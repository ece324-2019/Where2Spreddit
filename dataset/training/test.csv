"update my gf likes me to go by different names.. tl;dr: most of you were right, she was sleeping with matt.


here is  a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x4b5s/my_gf_likes_me_to_go_by_different_names/


i want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded. 

after i made my post, i waited 2 days to say anything to her because i wanted to get as much input as possible. i also took that time to prepare myself to separate.

i started reading comments right after i posted. i replied to a few but after so many telling me that she was cheating on me with me, i started to feel sick. i called my boss to ask for friday off for personal reasons. i spent the day driving around, looking for potential apartments. we don't live together but i wanted to make sure if things went bad, she'd have a harder time finding me. we also have some good memories in that apartment and i think i would be sad if i had to continue to live there. 

this brings us to saturday, the day i promised myself i would say something. i invited her over for breakfast but instantly regretted it because i was getting so nervous that i completely lost my appetite. she walked in the door and instantly knew something was different. i was hoping to ease into it, but i ended up blurting out, ""i met matt blank"". she tried to act casual about it, but i could tell she didn't expect me to know about him. for the next 3 or so minuted things were calm, i talked about how i see the past 4 months completely differently. she started to cry and say she was sorry, i don't mean some tears but full on ugly crying. i told her i'm going to work on forgiving her, because if i don't i think it will eat me up inside. i won't forget what happened but i'll at least try to move on. she started to talk about how she'll work on building my trust again. i interrupted her by saying that that isn't necessary, as we were no longer together. 

if i wasn't so emotionally crushed, i would have been amazed at the transition. she started begging me to give her another chance. i stood up and went to my room to grab a few boxes of all the gifts she gave me. i told her that i had already made up my mind to break up with her. after some back and forth, she realized that i was serious. i knew the exact moment she knew i was serious because she went from crying to yelling. it started off with insults and when that didn't work she tried throwing the truth in my face to hurt me. it started off that i was fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, and i had a useless job. in the middle of her tirade, she said matt's dick was way bigger than mine.

as she was yelling at me, she ended up saying what happened between the two of them. i'll summarize below:

she started sleeping with matt 3 years ago, they were on some sort of work trip and ended up drunkenly sleeping together. from there it went from once in a while to once a week. matt called things off 4 months ago because he met a girl. i think she was using the vacations because she missed being with matt. 

i don't really remember the rest of saturday. i spent sunday with my friends which helped, i told them what happened which was nice to get off my chest. i went to work as normal yesterday, at some point in the day she slipped a note under my door. i'm not sure what it said because i burned it. ",8
"if i report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to hr for basically slut shaming me?. i've \f21\ recently encountered a new sexual partner. we used a condom, but after words i felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time i have ever hooked up with someone i just met. my previous sexual partners have all been someone i have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. while condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a sti, it cannot provide absolute protection. a few days ago, i noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an std. i have never had one before and i have no idea the symptoms, but an std was all i could think about. 


i went to an urgent care because i wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or uti) and if not, i wanted to send my urine off for an std screening.  my doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which i was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


it came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. she says based on my symptoms, i am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and std screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


as i'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" i sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""with all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". i looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". at this point, i was pretty fucking angry. you could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. i thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

i was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn i get slut shamed for it? i posted this in a forum about sexual education and i was getting advice to report her to hr. i don't want to go after anybody's job, but i don't want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

will i be the asshole if i report her to hr or should i leave it alone?

edit: for everybody asking, i was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. i just kind of stared at her because i immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information i shared with her so openly. so after a couple of seconds she said ""i appreciate your openness and honesty tho"" (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so i just said ""thanks"" and left. i was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. trust me, i wish i would have but i wasn't even thinking about going off on her. i was just embarrassed. 

also, she was a nurse practitioner. i know a couple of times i referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was np. 

and for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that i'm having more fun than u 😘


update

before i start off with the update, i want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) i am not heartless, and in the original post i even directly said i did not want to go for her job. that was never my intention and i even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you're obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. i also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody i just met, so ""closing my legs"" or ""quit being easy"" doesn't fucking apply. in game if thrones, every single ""whore"" had one thing in common and that's that they enjoyed sex. so if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) for teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. what you decide to do with your body is really nobody's business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

now to the update: 
i called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or np supervisor. they didn't have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the nps was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

first and foremost, i explained to the manager that i in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. i did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or pip to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

i explained to her everything that happened and before i could even say who the np was, she knew exactly who i was talking about...which confirmed that she's most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

i then explained how i confided in her and that i came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. i explained that her words didn't hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers and future interactions with her other women patients. 

the lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she'd ""call the doctor (her supervisor)"" right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. she also said she was placing a note and that the np wouldn't be back in the office until next monday. 

with all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! you've truly been so helpful. 

and for the people calling me a slut for this, i hope to god this same thing doesn't happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",3
"beaches are fuckin shite. right, so you got to the beach, where it's really hot and there's sand everywhere. then you need to get semi naked in public, then you need to walk to the water on sand that's hotter than the depths of hell. you get in the water, and your feet are instantly stabbed by millions of sharp shells. what's that? you need to piss? do it in the water like a fucking toddler. ya need to shit? well fuck right off and hold it in for several hours. but then, something brushes up against your leg: slimy, squishy vegetation, and it feels fucking disgusting. then, after you get out of the water, you find that all your shit has been blown about by the wind or stolen by beach bums. even if you still have all your stuff, you must make a choice: go home full of sand, or change in an out-house, that smells like someone died. oh hahaha btw your car is full of sand now.
 * edit: apparently when i was a baby my parents took me to the beach, as soon as i touched sand i started to cry. i never really liked the beach.",6

"by bodyslamming a girl who wanted to hug me.. i was in a new high school with absolutely no friends whatsoever and because i was very socially awkward i tried to avoid any direct confrontations with any individual whatsoever so i never really made any friends.

however in my fourth block there was this girl who i just seemed to have clicked with because out of all the students in the entire building she was the only one i really actually talked to. skip a couple of weeks i'm coming into my class when she decides to greet me with a friendly hug. 

in this moment i was completely frozen because i never really physically interact with anyone, especially females. so in this moment, i go full brain dead and as she's approaching me with open arms i decided i was going to try and be funny and pick her up from her waist and throw her over my shoulder (don't ask why i thought this would be funny, because i honestly have no clue what the fuck i was thinking) but the second she sees me go down and try and pick her up i could just see the complete and udder confusion in her face as she was just simply wanting a quick hug, but as i pick her up just to make things ten times worse, i shout,

""wwe supah slammmm!!"" 

and she's screaming and for some reason my heart just dropped realizing what i was doing and instead of lightly setting her down, i just fucking drop her and she slams right into a cluster of desks making this massive crashing sound in the middle of the room. i went to ask her if she was okay but she started crying her eyes out basically asking me what the fuck was wrong with me.

tl;dr i shouldn't be allowed around people.",4
"wi my girlfriend's landlord just entered her house when he thought nobody was home.. my girlfriends landlord entered her house after he talked to her as she was going to work. he believed nobody to. be home, but i was here laying in bed. i woke up to him coming into the apartment to use the bathroom and then leaving. when i said something as he was leaving he ignored me. i text my girlfriend about it to see if she had given him permission to enter and she said no. he did have permission to enter the building at 11 am to show her apartment, but this was at 9:30 am and he had no tenant to sho the apartment to. he just came in, used the bathroom and left. he didn't even finish flushing the toilet. 

when i confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. he then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. and when i explained to him that i had every right to be there because i had permission from the tenant to be there, he said ""okay, i'll let you go this time."" 

my girlfriend feels uncomfortable here because he just entered the unit without her permission. how can we make sure he doesn't do this again? 

also, the dude didn't even finish flushing the toilet and left a turd in it.

"by deleting reddit's #1 top post of all time. happened just now. sorry for my possible slips as english is not my mothertongue. i mostly only lurk around, but this time i decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

i've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. usually when i get depressed at home i start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because i like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

see, since i'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""accounts"" folder and terminating the ones i don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). the thing is i used to have an imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so i decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since i didn't get it by registering at the service directly. i'll omit the details of all the cyber sex i went through with my keyboard and the browser, but i somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so i pretty much forgot about the whole deal. but little did i know.

later in the day i get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. in addition to that i still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. being the total jackass of an idiot that i am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, i decide to google the #1 top reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on imgur (yeah, the one about the senate, with a total of whole damn 310k updoots). i open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise satan himself. of course imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? it can't be this bugged, right? (i hadn't clicked one by then yet). so i click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this tifu.

i'm sorry. i didn't want to. please, forgive me everyone.
i'll commit sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.
if somebody working for imgur sees it here, please, report it to who it would be most appropriate.

edit: link for clarification (try clicking the original ""senate"" post's title link).

edit 2.0: **i guess *i am the senate* now**

edit 2.6.5.32: i submitted the bug to imgur's contact form just in case...

edit 4.1.15: **just got from work to find a message from u/_bindersfullofwomen_(https://www.reddit.com/user/_bindersfullofwomen_) on the behalf of imgur's team, so the bug seems to be closed by now, the picture's back too** that's pretty cool and fast of a reaction for such a huge service, especially for me since it's already post working hours for me (i know, i know, time zones'n'shiiieeet).

"girlfriend (22f) mad about my (24m) answer to scenario, what do i do?. so girlfriend and i had just finished having sex. we were laying there just cuddling and not saying anything, i was dozing off and then she randomly said ""your love for me is unconditional right?"" and i mean i say that all the time so i didn't think much of it and i said ""yes, i will love you no matter what,even if you had one eye or 12 fingers"" and it was clearly a joke. she kisses me but then says "" so if i turned into a donkey right now you would still love me?"" .... i was confused because it was such a random question and i laughed and just said ""i don't know about that, i'd love you as a pet i guess""

she sits up and says ""are you fucking serious?!"" at this point i'm completely lost. i just sat there and she says ""as a pet... that's it?"" i said ""i mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?..."" she says ""still love me like you just claimed that you did, it's funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey i would still love you unconditionally and i would not treat you like 'a pet'"" .... i had no idea what was going on and how we even ended up in this argument. i just said "" if you were a donkey how else was i supposed to love you aside from being a pet?? am i supposed to treat you like my girlfriend still??"" she says ""i'm not saying you would have to take a donkey on a date.. but you knew it was me so why would your love me suddenly change just because of my appearance?!"" ... i just stopped talking because i didn't want to say anything else wrong. 

i'm just confused. she was so upset that she got her clothes on and slept on the couch. what did i say? i have no idea what exactly she was upset about. am i not looking into this deep enough? i'm genuinely confused as to what i did and how to fix it. i don't want to say something and make it worse.

"for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when i found out the child wasn't mine?. my ex and i had been together for 2 years.  it was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  i also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually i broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

a few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  she was practically beaming with glee.  i agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  didn't want my child subjected to that.

the one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  she very happily agreed.  her reaction actually washed away some of the fears i had about her possibly cheating on me.  so she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  we find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped i honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

this was a week ago.  she moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  she, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how i'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  that i have plenty of room in my home and i should just help her out.  i feel like i've been through the emotional ringer these past months and i've been though every emotion i am capable of feeling.  from realizing i was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly i feel so emotionally raw and sometimes i agree with them.  that maybe i should take her back and just care for the kid.

was i unfair to this unborn child?  am i a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  she cheated on me, but is this a situation that i should suck it up and take care of them anyway?",3
"for telling my grandma she looks like ronald mcdonald because she wouldn't stop telling me i look like a bull with my nose ring in?. edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought i'd make an edit. my piercing is not a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. septum piercings are usually tagged as ""looking like a bull"" (i don't agree with that) but i have my hoop in my nostril.

here's how it happened. every time i see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of ""take that thing out of your nose, you're ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull."" the last time she said it to me i politely asked her to leave it alone or next time i wouldn't be so polite. to be fair this is the first time i spoke up because i'm not confrontational but the older i get the more i stand up for myself. and for that matter, i shouldn't even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. i immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like ronald mcdonald. a lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but a) i warned her and asked her to stop and b) she's insulting my appearance so why is what i said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? i'm usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn't even make sense) does not ""ruin"" my face and even if it does it's really not her place. i'm a grown ass woman and i refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman. 

so, was i the asshole?",3
"tsa detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the er and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.. i'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

my father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a port(https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/cdr756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  we came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (new york) facing the customer directly at our shop. they sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. i'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. however, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

today, they were flying from tn (i don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to houston, tx, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   he had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (brooklyn, ny) and in texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which i will request from his doctors tomorrow)  he also brings a printout from the tsa about traveling with a port and cancer which i will find the exact link to when i get more info.  

my parents arrive 3:45 to a tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
both parents have tsa pre and get on line at about 4. they are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  the agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the id, etc.  my father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. meanwhile i assume he is not speaking his best english, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. i'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which i think adds to the confusion. they wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. they don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  they go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   my father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  he calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  he tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (his first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) they take him into a small room away from my mother. he is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  the agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. the agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  my father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  i have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. he couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

he tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) the agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   the agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. my father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  they bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  they wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  they agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  they take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. he asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. by this point the plane has left.  they go to the er to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

he has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  my father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  port is ok but they want to check him out again before flying.

i would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. if he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? they have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. i am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so i have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that i can go over with her later, so i'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
my family is very quiet, i don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  i would if that is the only option, however.  i don't know if it's relevant that we are muslim, either, i assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  my father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  he doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  i would love some advice.  apologies for length.

"my 22f boyfriend of 3 years 23m and i just had a huge fight over a tampon.. yes. you read that correctly. the subject matter is... a tampon. to preface, i took a plan b recently and with that comes your period. so today i woke up at about 7 am as i began my menstrual cycle. going to skip the tmi, and simply say i had to run immediately to our bathroom (located in our room). unfortunately there were no tampons in our bathroom they were downstairs. i asked my bf to please go get me one from downstairs and he refused. just a straight up ""no i'm sleeping and tired leave me alone"" i tried to explain to him that it was an emergency and i really needed his help in that moment as i was essentially stuck on the toilet and he just replied with ""no use a towel or something and you go get it"". i started crying bc i'm a fairly emotional person and it really made me sad that he wouldn't help me when i really needed it. he is the reason i currently got my period anyways (plan b). well i guess my crying upset him even more so he got up and said i ""do too much"" and tried to slam the bathroom door so he could ignore me. in the process he clipped my legs and as a result turned my whole body which turned the toilet seat, essentially breaking it off. i know all of this sounds bad, typing it out really shows me how disturbing his reaction was. i guess i'm just trying to be level headed and see if there are any opposing perspectives. was i being too dramatic or am i justified in wanting to break up over this? his reaction in general tells me that he does not know how to conduct himself maturely and respectfully. but to play the devil's advocate, he is a d1 college athlete so he is on a very tight schedule with long days resulting in him being tired most of the time. sorry if this is rambling just looking for opinions before i move out and back home across the country. bc if i decide that there is no coming back (my parents wouldn't let me lol).

edit: he is home from practice. not sorry. not remorseful. still blaming me for doing too much. i can't stop crying. i showed him all of your responses and he said you're all wrong and i'm stupid for taking advice from reddit. i'm heartbroken.

edit 2: i fuckin love reddit man. i'm sitting here crying but every response i read makes me feel a little stronger. i'm the biggest cry baby ever and i really thought i loved this guy. so naturally i'm super sad. but i need this. i needed to be shown that this isn't normal or ok. thank you guys.

edit 3: ok guys.. tmi warning.. some are saying why didn't i just put some toilet paper in my undies and walk downstairs. i slept naked and woke up to blood all over my legs. ran to the bathroom and didn't want to get up and get blood everywhere. it was coming out profusely and i didn't want to get up until i was able to insert a tampon.",8
"by stripping in front of my girlfriends bff's nsfw. it's as stupid as it sounds.

yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her bffs. they usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

around that time i'm usually at the gym so to not disturb them. but yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so i went there an hour earlier.

sometimes after i come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
so i come home early and hear the tv running and i assumed, that she didn't hear me.
that's when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

i busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. some get red and look away, some stare at me like they've never seen a man's privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved wtf. 

the silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. i uttered a loud fuck and she instantly replied with: „good plan, bad execution."" her friends all laughed and even i had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

i even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

tl;dr: busted naked into my so's girl evening.

of course i ran home naked to surprise my girlfriend.

yes, i plan to marry my so. plan includes me naked-manning her girls evening again with her ring around my cock and a bow tie.

"for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (about $700). i had a party at my house last night. i have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. my step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but i'm not a casino and while i'm not destitute, i can't afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

so was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

edit: sorry guys i can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because i've been banned.

edit2: wow since i'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) i might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. i'm really that bad? i just thought i had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>if this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. forget our votes, listen to those. also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

if the moderators allow me to update, i will absolutely update and tell you how many friends i've lost. almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. and he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). in addition, i will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (az) and ask what trouble i might be in. i will also update on that when i can. people can't be this dramatic in real life...i'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and i'm still blown away by some of these comments. call me yta all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

edit4: well i was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  makes info hard but i'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why i can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? another friend says wow, that's cool i have $1.25 in my pocket, can i donate to your change jar? you'd say yes. now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey i just put .80 into your change jar, now i'm taking the whole thing."" you would say no. it's how i've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. i've given people quarters to play, i've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. i've taken in maybe $100 over five years. maybe. that's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


edit5: a good question:

>info did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? if no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

no he did not, the first time i ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  i don't mind if people play it, i even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

edit6: another good question

>also, need more info. you stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). did you let them keep it? if so, why are you making a double-standard here?


i would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. i do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why i'm asking here. but i do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits i wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

edit7: 

>info
we need to know where the money came from. did the money in the machine come from you putting it in or playing the machine

so this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). she said it gets full at $800. it was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, i always guessed $500. in five years it's now 7/8ths full. i play it from to time to time so i'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. i think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night i've ever seen that window empty. i know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so i may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if i'm way off base.

edit8: this is the best yta take so far and i can't let it get buried.

> i really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. i love the comments that say ""your edits make you yta! alone. where did the money come from btw?""  i truly can accept the yta votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. i wasn't profiting off this machine. i've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. i can't afford to give a random dude $700. i don't need it now, but i have savings account i don't need it now either but i might some day. and now i've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. so good thing i hung onto them right ? (i can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. i never cleaned it out because honestly i like the way it looked with the coins in the window. this thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. some nice ntas have suggested i have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. i actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (i got it five years ago) so i always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. as an example, over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. i had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. he was heartbroken when he didn't win (i might have given it to him since he was so cute) but i gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so i always, always give people money back if they ask. i never intended to profit off the machine. no one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>i bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who dm'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, i was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. my slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said i could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. in my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. so it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. there wasn't a jackpot at all. i don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. the guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  i still don't care if i'm yta till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. and fuck that guy.


edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that i will not be allowed to update this post. so the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. so had i been a real casino i would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. so yeah, i was totally in the right. fuck this sub. fuck the moderators. and fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. most of you however were cool.",3

"my school is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (ga). i found this out about two hours ago. my  high school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

in the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; all students who drive to school using a personal vehicle must give the school a copy of the key or key fob.

after i read this i thought it was a misprint or a mistake. so i called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

about 30 minutes later i checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. they went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

i personally find this to be a invasion of privacy. what can i do to stop this?

edit: campus is the only place around to park at without paying $100 for a parking pass.

update: the school removed the policy after a car was broken into using the keys from the office. thank you all for the help",2

"neighbor tresspassed on my property and posted online my custom carved wood in my yard as free for taking. it was taken by someone mistakenly thinking it was hers to give away. how can i proceed legall?. long story short, i live in ny. my bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. i had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. this lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) i came home to my wood missing and i found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. i contacted the guy, and got it back. i then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the ny state government property lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. i told her to never do that again and mind her own business. her response was ""i am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" after that passive aggressive bullshit i went to the police. i filed for tresspassing. the cop said i could get her for possible larceny. idk how that wouldnwork if she didnt take it herself. i'm just wondering... how far can i push this? i am now completely uncomfortable with doing future projects in my own yard and the entire town i live in now knows my exact address attached to my name because of this lady. the cops said they would go to her home and ask her side of the story... i have pictures of her post, pictures of my property line and screenshots of many people i didnt know very well, asking me if her post was in fact the wood on my property that i had posted on my own fb that i was in search for, linking my exact name to that exact address. i work as a bartender in town, where i have many strange men i dont want knowing where i live. she posted it to my towns facebook page. maybe if she was more kind i would have let bygons be bygons but now, i'm thinking ""the world sure can be a bear""",2

"i 22f read my parents' texts and found out my immediate family pretty much despises me.. i honestly don't even know where to start here... i haven't lived at home for the past four years of undergrad because i function better when i'm not around my family all the time.  i think and function differently from them, which is something i thought was ok and not a source of conflict until this morning.  i'm moving in a month for grad school so i moved back home for the summer to save a bit of money.  the entire summer both my siblings and my parents have been very nasty (mostly in the way of exclusionary and passive aggressive behavior) towards me despite minimal confrontation or conflicts occurring.  it's been really upsetting but i've tried to push it aside.  i've heard them talking about me behind my back on multiple occasions and even seen text messages over my sister's shoulder between her and my mom calling me disgusting and really just trashing me in any way they know how.

i am aware that what i did was wrong / i shouldn't have done it, but my dad went to the grocery store and left his phone at our house.  everyone else was sleeping and morbid curiosity got the best of me, so i opened it (he doesn't have a passcode) and went through he and my mother's texts together.  i don't know what exactly i was expecting to find, perhaps a few sparing texts about me, i don't know, but i was completely shocked to find that the majority of their conversations are about how much they despise me.  like this is to the point where they purposely plan family lunches/dinners/movie nights/etc when they *know* i am working or otherwise busy and invite me even though they know i can't go so that it's not obvious they don't want me in attendance.  i'm not even worthy of a name in their conversations, as my dad merely refers to me as ""the bitch"" and my mother follows suit.  my mom says things like ""it's so funny how she acts like her life is so great but she can't be genuinely happy because she is the most miserable bitch i have ever met.""  they say i bring down the mood, i walk into the room and i'm a bitch, etc.

there are also several texts where my dad will message my mom complaining about how annoying i'm being and she will respond saying my sister and brother are also texting her the same thing and they'll laugh about it.  so while i'm in the room with my entire family, they are texting about how insufferable i am.

i think the worst thing of all is that my sister outed me to my entire family.  i came out to her in december after being closeted for years and it was a very huge step for me to do this as my family is not very supportive of the lgbtq+ community and i was terrified to tell anyone.  i told her i wasn't ready to share this information with anyone and she turned around and told everyone in my family about it.  they are ""sickened"" by my ""lifestyle"" and have no issue with her mistreating me because she disagrees with my ""lifestyle"" (yes, that is what they are calling it).

growing up i was always straight-laced, kept my head down, and did what i was supposed to.  i am good in school and got involved with community service/volunteering and excelled in varsity sports.  i've also worked since i was fourteen.  i pay for all of my expenses and never ask for a thing from my parents.  in college i had a 4.0 and i got into multiple top phd programs straight out of undergrad.  i won multiple prestigious awards in undergrad whose ceremonies both my parents never bothered showing up at.  i am the black sheep and they abuse me for it.

i know snooping was wrong and i'm not sure what i expected to find doing something like this but damn, this hurts like hell.  i've always felt generally ostracized and sort of disliked by my family but i tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety going into overdrive and brushed it off.  but these were not mere hunches, they are true.  i feel sick to my stomach and absolutely numb, and i'm honestly not sure how i should proceed from here.  should i try to bring things up with my family?  should i just bide my time for the next few weeks until i move?

tldr: i knew my family was talking about me behind my back so i read my parents' texts and found horrible messages about me and also found out that my sister outed me to my family.

**edit:** thank you so much everyone for the outpour of support, kindness, and advice.  i initially really just needed to get this off my chest and find a soundboard in the reddit community but you all have rallied and helped me significantly.  i am trying my best to respond to your numerous comments, messages, and pms offering support and love but there are a lot to go through so please know i see you and appreciate you very much!

some people have shared that i've come across as very superior- and pretentious-sounding in the comments.  i want to apologize for that and express that this was not my intention.  i was simply trying to share that i've had multiple achievements that i would like to *share* and *celebrate* with my family, but instead they seem to scorn me for them.  success should be shared amongst families, not be a divisive factor!

**edit 2:** just going to answer a few of the common questions i'm seeing in the comments here.

* yes, my family is religious.  they are catholic.  i am not religious but keep quiet about this and still bow my head in prayer at supper and participate in everything they would like me to.
* no, i do not spew my political beliefs to them or anywhere near them.  in fact, i hardly talk politics.  i do not post my views on social media or engage in political discourse on social media.  when my parents are talking politics, i merely listen respectfully and offer no opposition to what they have to say.  i pick my battles, and politics / religion are not battles i prefer to have.
* yes, i have friends.  no, my relationships outside my immediate family are not negative.  i generally get along well with others at work, school, and in social environments.
* my relationship with my extended family is positive and healthy.
* no, i am not adopted.

**edit 3:** copying and pasting a response to a comment on the thread.  a lot of people are confused about how much my family's mistreatment of me ties into my queerness.  here's a bit more context that i definitely should have provided earlier:

the issues with my sister started after i came out to her! this is definitely something i should have clarified, i'm sorry. here's the story:

i was dating this really awesome girl in december who has been out and proud since middle school. i was falling for her and realized that it wasn't fair to her to have to be dating someone in the closet, so i decided it was time to start taking steps towards being out. i figured baby steps were the way to go, so i started with my sister. my sister and i have told each other a lot of private information in the past and i thought i could trust her with this. i was initially hesitant to tell her because she has made ignorant homophobic comments in the past and casually uses slurs such as ""dyke"" and sees no issue with it. however, one of my good friends told me that her family was the same way and when she came out they realized how horrible their behavior had been, felt awful about it, and apologized profusely. so i figured that if my sister knew about me, maybe she would realize the weight of her unkind words. i told her and she was definitely surprised/caught off guard by it and acted a little awkward. but after that nothing happened and no mention was made of it. she began just acting a little stiff and awkward around me which over the course of several months has escalated into resentment and bullying. now mind you, my parents have been resentful and harsh towards me for the past several years, but my siblings at least usually had my back and i felt like i had some support with them. but once i came out to my sister, things slowly started to change.

in early july, we were at our cousins' house and i was in the bathroom. the house is small with thin walls and i overheard a conversation in which my sister and brother were expressing their disgust towards me because of my sexuality. so i realized at that point that my sister had outed me to my brother and now to my cousin. at this point i realized that she was really betraying my trust and clearly didn't care much for my privacy and well-being, but i still didn't think she would tell my parents, knowing their thoughts and opinions on gay people. well, she did. i'm not sure when exactly, but in their text messages they were excusing her mistreatment of me because they understand that she does not agree with my ""lifestyle.""

i'm going to paste this comment in a third edit on my main post because a lot of redditors are confused at lacking context. well, here is some more. this situation is complex and something i am struggling to make sense of myself, so before you make an unkind comment calling me things such as a ""bitch,"" a ""whore,"" and a ""cunt,"" among other slurs, please realize that i am in the dark here as well.",8

for example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish honda. when we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. she was furious we didn't bring gf's land rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. gf doesn't like to drive on long trips and i'm not allowed to drive the land rover (per her parents) so we brought my honda. 

gf's dad has never spoken to me directly. even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""what does he do?"" so we went in the house and i gave her dad the usual, ""hi, merry christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

one more example: last year i made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. it was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and i even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. gf's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to gf they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

we managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which i'd normally consider a win. but today i keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if i'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. gf and i have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but i know they'll never accept me. if we get married i'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. gf has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but i can tell it bothers her too. they bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and i think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

so, not to sounds like an asshole, but am i wasting my time? is this relationship doomed? gf always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but i'm not sure that's true. she always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. but i know i'll never be good enough for them, even if i'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: my girlfriend's rich parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.",8
"i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone. i am sick, devastated and don't know what to do.. first time poster so i apologize if this is rambly. to preface: i started dating david (not real name obv) at the beginning of february.  only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship i was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well that i didn't think much more about it. i fell hard and he did too. things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and i can't afford the place by myself). he and i have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and i have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time i've known him, so i didn't really see any red flags there. everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

last week i came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and i played it off like i had no idea what he was doing. fast forward to two days ago, i was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (i don't care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. so when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, i quickly peeked through his search history. there was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly ""teen"". i didn't think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then i saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. ""p*do pics"" etc had been entered around 5 times. 

i quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, i had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. i couldn't imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; i know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. so last night i peeked through his photos on his iphone and was traumatized. there were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while i'd fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. i felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

a bit further up in his photos i discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. they all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. i was numb, i was angry, i was devastated, i couldn't think and i was so disturbed at what i was witnessing. i have never seen cp in my life and i can't get these horrible images out of my head. i scrolled pretty far up and didn't really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the ""petite teen"" category. 

i guess i'm just posting here because i have no idea what else to do. i don't know how to confront him and i know i must separate from him immediately but i'm terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and i don't want to get in trouble. he must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  he practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially i am fucked by this. 


please help reddit, i feel so lost.

tldr: i discovered cp on my boyfriends phone last night. not sure how to proceed with anything.",8

"by forgetting babies exist.. so i've been spending a lot of time around dogs. i've recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. my reddit is covered in dogs from various sources. my facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. basically everywhere i turn, i see dog. not a bad life to live. until yesterday (yifu i know). i walked one of my mother's friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. it wasn't very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. it's hot. i've just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. i want to blame dehydration for this fu, but really i know i'm just an idiot. a couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. my first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. i don't know. it's a hot day and i've seen dogs in pushchairs before. maybe they didn't want its paws on hot tarmac. maybe they're just a little extra. regardless, the thought that babies exist didn't enter my tiny stupid brain. as they got up to leave and walk by me, i decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words ""what breed is it?"" and gestured towards the pushchair. they looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. it was a baby. a human baby. i'm so glad they took the traditional british approach of confused stare and silence. if they had said something i think i would have disintegrated on the spot. it was a long walk home after that and thankfully, i didn't pass anymore pushchairs. 

tl;dr i asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the internet.",4

"by making myself an uncle nsfw. so this started 2 weeks ago

i went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a gf.

 naturally i start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. i get to teasing him about him not losing his v card, my mom is not liking the conversation. his gf ends up coming over, i stopped the teasing i'm not a monster. so i'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. i tell her not to worry about it i'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

i get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. my argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised ying and yang i grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. he grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. saying how a party would be good for him i even offered to go, (i'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, i told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (i know how that sounds). so i finally convinced her she agreed.

so i decide that i need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. i knew my bro was losing it that night. fast forward to the party, i drop him off so my mom thinks imma be there. i pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. well holy fuck did i get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  so now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and i'm becoming an uncle.

tl;dr convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his v card, he got his gf pregnant. 


update 1: so she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. so we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. i'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. my brother is getting tested for sti's i was all over him about that. also thanks for the gold and silver (i have no idea what that does). thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

update 2: everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. my brother does not have any sti's or std's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,i'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. there are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can dm and i can explain what i did if curious, how i got out, how my life has changed and all. 

update 3: *in maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! mother is crying brother is in shock and the gfs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. everyone pray for this child. 


update 4: they are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, i helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. i've started a savings account for him, and my gf and i are going to move into a place with him and his gf to help them out.",4
"update this man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, i have a specific question regarding something i want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.. i would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). sorry for not updating you right away as i was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

so here's what happened. i liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. so i hired a guy which i'll call him frank.

after waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

a few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom i recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. we went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. shockingly he was completely understanding. he told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both frank and i a settlement if i agree not to sue. i called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed frank for his drone plus way more money that i would've ever paid him. he also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that i wont pursue any legal action.

it was a happy ending and i was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but i must admit that i feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. never have i felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. while we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! so the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and i'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",2
"my brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. what actions should i take against him?. hello. i'm a first-time poster, and i'm also on mobile. i am 19, and i currently live in new york city.

my parents died when my brothers and i were young (eldest was 11, second (the brother in question) was 7, and i was 5). they left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. i turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. it was in march 2019 that i finally got it. it turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. i decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. i wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. i called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after i deposited the money. my savings account has also been taken from. i'll admit, i really should have been paying more attention, but i was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and i got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. we tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. he had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

when i confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. he spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. i know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. it's just line after line of uber eats, postmates, and game purchases. my grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. it would take years for him to make that money back on minimum wage. should i call the police and have him arrested? is there any way to get that money back?


edit: okay, i've decided to call the police and sue the bank. i know how to get my hands on bank statements, and i'll record him confessing to the theft. but i don't know how to hire a lawyer. where do i start?

edit #2: okay i just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. my grandma sends him to the store with her atm card sometimes to get money. he memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

edit #3: thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. i got a ton of messages and i'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

i've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. we're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. haven't gotten him arrested yet, but i told her if need be, i would call them myself.

i like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. my mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. she explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. she had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an atm.

edit #4: so i went to the bank. because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. no case to sue the bank with. there's nothing i can do to get the money back. i'm ruined financially. all i can do is sue him and put him in jail, but i'm never gonna see that money again. i'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and i'm sorry if i haven't responded to your messages yet. also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. this will be the last edit i make, hopefully.",2
"for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?. i'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. i've lived there for 6 years. my neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (i actually don't know her first name but i'll call her katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. we exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

so i don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, i don't have as much money for takeout anymore. i'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. i'm gaining weight and i never feel great.

this is where katie comes in. i can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (i know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). i've even complimented it a few times. so i got the idea that i'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or i can pick it up from her!) at night. she's cooking anyway and then i'd have varied presumably delicious food.

i asked her the next time i saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). the next time i saw her a few days later, i asked her if she was sure and upped the amount i was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and i should get a housekeeper if that's what i want. she also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like i was being creepy (i wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). i think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

so, aita?

edit: people keep assuming i'm sexist because i didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. it's not an assumption for me. he and i have lived across from each other for 6 years. the cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and i've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

edit: okay. it is abundantly clear that i was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as i hate to admit it, creepy. my instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, i'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. thanks.",3

"buying my son's halloween candy away from him. my kids go trick or treating. we live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

when they're young we tell them santa brings every boy and girl a present on halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he'd leave in exchange. 

when the kids get old enough to realize santa is a hoax, that's when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

did this with our oldest two and it worked great. they'd give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the santa thing. we explained the new deal. 

he said ""so then it's my money and i can buy *whatever* i want with it? a new skateboard even? *anything*?"" ""you bet."" ""swear?"" ""yep."" 

he goes and brings us **all** his candy. even every kit kat, his favorite. i was shocked, but he'd been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must've decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 i'd spent all week. 

next day i brought the candy to work. then we went to walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. we met at the check out. 

there's my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred kit kats for $10.00. 

i started to tell him to put it back, but he said ""what? you said i could buy *whatever* i wanted! you swore! i want my candy back then."" 

his candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. and i did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

so... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

i don't know who's more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this.

"(nyc) i am being harassed by the orthodox jewish ""police"" in my home. this has been going on for almost 2 years since i moved in. i am at my wits end, what can i do to stop it?. **edit2: putting this here since this is locked. thank everyone for all the advice/support. i will be following some of the advice recieved and update once i have one. if this works i'll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what i've been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance i'll have no choice but to move. thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. that has been expecially helpful because it's put my situation into perspective. yeah it sucks but worst case i can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn't the case for people within the community. and even though the nypd has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i've found myself in for what it is. will update when i can.**


*edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home seven times. and this is common.*

i live in brooklyn ny. i purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. i honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

since i moved in though, this has been a huge issue. i don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. i honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. the issue is that they have been using the jewish police to harass me. 
to give you an idea of the shit i am dealing with i'll tell you what prompted this post.  i chose to have a superbowl viewing party today. about 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were five people here) i get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. we were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). my condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people i invited from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. i don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that i have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

i am fucking done. i want this to stop. i have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. i have tried calling the nypd every time they show up. this has not worked. i have complained to my condo association. no help. i have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city and state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and nothing has worked. i keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home that i own with my permission. 

im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. i am just so fed up with this bullshit. i am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a home i own on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

"neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp. my boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. i've done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. my front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn't very visible from the street. i painted it to match the house as well.

few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife's never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which i chalked up to her being shy or whatever. however, recently i got a note taped up to my door that said she's going to sue if i don't take the ramp down, as it's an eyesore and ""reduces curbside value."" i have no idea what she means since you can't see the thing unless you know what to look for and really get up in my property, as confirmed by neighbors and friends.

"for propositioning a girl in the gym?. please hear me out before you judge because while i did say what you're thinking i didn't say it in the way you're thinking.

the gym i go to is very small. not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. this means working out fairly close to people even if you don't mean to. yesterday i (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (one would do a set while the other waited beside them) the girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend ""ugh i hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.""

i shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. i was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so i'm not entirely sure if it's an actual well known exercise) 

the same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf ""look there she goes again, and her forms terrible."" which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

at this point i call her out. i said ""oi, you."" she immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. so i called her out again specifically ""you in the purple top."" 

she turned round and asked what i wanted. the following conversation happens:

me; do you want to fuck me?
her: what?!
me: i said do you want to fuck me?
her: what the fuck is wrong with you?
me: well you keep staring at me, so i'm assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

she went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. i carried on with my workout and didn't see them again.

when i told my friend what happened, he said i acted like a dick and that as a woman i should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. he also pointed out that i embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

my defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn't talk shit if she doesn't want called out on it.

i'll admit that i'm a pretty confrontational person and i could have reacted better but i also think she should mind her own business.",3
"by suggesting to my bf that he get testicle implants. i've been dating this guy for a few months. he has a fetish for petite asian girls, that i know. but he also has a thing for big breasts, which i attribute to his ""hentai porn"" fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. 

in the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. he would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me i'd be ""perfect"" if i got some saline implants to fill a dd cup, as a ""joke"" of course. (dd is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34c, but still insulting to me.)

so i finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. i told him most petite asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. he did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great i'd look in a double d while we were out having brunch. 

so i snapped, and i said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. well he didn't take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. he hasn't returned any of my texts since. 

tl;dr: i underestimated how fragile my bf's ego is concerning his balls and i insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.

edit/update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. i tried calling him to apologize since he's ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(

more edit: i'm very sorry if i gave the wrong impression of him here. words are very limited. he really is a good guy otherwise. i know and i hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. but i really like him (and his balls big or small!). i did not mean to hurt him this deeply and i'm just so sad right now that i hurt him this much. i feel like a terrible person. i shouldn't have reacted with cattiness that i didn't even mean because i like his balls just the way they are!

one last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies. not sure where this will go but i guess i'll see.",4
"grandmother with dementia charged $13,000 usd for clothes at strip mall in florida. my grandmother who is 91 with severe dementia was charged $13,000 for five pieces of clothes at a strip mall in west palm beach, florida. we have limited the amount of money she can spend (she wrote checks for the clothes) and so the checks bounced. i have contacted the store owners who sent a 'receipt' for her purchases which is hand written on a piece of paper (no store business information) and just says 'dress $4000' and 'skirt $3000', etc. 

&#x200b;

i strongly suspect that the owner just made up these prices (that normally they would be sold for much less) and my grandmother was incapably of discerning any of this. my grandmother can't drive and has a full-time caregiver who was with her (and did nothing to stop this).  the owner is now asking me to pay what is 'owed' on the clothes.

"acne can actually make a person more attractive.. i have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive. however, in my experience, for certain people it honestly kinda of fits well. have you ever met a person who you couldn't imagine without glasses? i'm convinced for certain people its the same with acne. to clarify, i am not talking about severe cystic acne. painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it. but people who have some minor scarring/breakouts it can really add to the character of their faces. this kind of laid back, natural, hippie kinda look. i can't really put my finger on it. it would be almost boring if you saw them with immaculate skin. and even though its already a golden rule, if they have confidence with their skin its even a bigger bonus.

edit: 

well this has never happened before. it's been kind of hilarious to read these comments going from: ""you're an absolutely disgusting vile human being"" to ""i 100% agree with you"". i'm also surprised at how unpopular this opinion really is! but i guess i put it in the right place lol. i'm not sure people should be thanking me either. i can be quite shallow as well. this is just one those subjective quirks i really enjoy and thought needed to be pointed out. but really if you read the comments some of the things you guys are into is pretty unconventional. beyond all these superficial traits though, i think the biggest thing to remember is that sometimes love just happens to you. you don't get to choose it. so stop worrying about who you're gonna pick. and as a the great redditor u/chief_economist once said: sit down, be humble. or was that kendrick lamar? anyway.",6
"by flashing my breasts...not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job.. i've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""early stages"" feels like i joke because i've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

as part of the hiring process for company x, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. it's a lot. i also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but i *really* hate my job. what can you do?

anyway, i pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me i'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. to ensure i'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, i have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

now, when i'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, i'm working from home for my current job. because i wfh, i'm not always the most presentable. we're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. i look bummy. i'm a bummy girl who works from home. to be clear though, i'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

anyway. i didn't take this into consideration when i opened up my computer for these tests. i *really* didn't take it into consideration when i opened up the program to begin the tests. i only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

and then...because apparently i have no shame??? i decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). this was a super sobering moment, guys.

i really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. so, i stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. while getting up, i haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. i took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. that's when i realized i wasn't wearing a bra (why would i be. i'm wfh, remember?), and the shirt i'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. i started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. i pull one out, put it on. dig through my closet for that single shirt i was looking for. find it, put it on. bam. ready.

i flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). getting myself all situated, i went to push record to start the exam.

there was no record button.

instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. it read something like 00:09:04.

it had been recording the entire time. the whole time.

me cringing at my reflection? recorded. me smelling my sweatshirt? recorded. me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *recorded.*

i had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. for an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

i can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when i realized. i definitely whisper-spoke  ""*fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. maybe a blacked out? i don't know. what i did know in that moment, was that i was royally fucked. the recorded video submitted when you closed the window. there was nothing i could do.

and then...because i'm a dumbass, guys. i went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

so. that's it. there you have it. i might now have nudes on the internet. i might get my recruiter fired for nsfw videos. or, who knows? i might get the job.

tl;dr by not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. i may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire hr department.

today i have strep. strep as an adult is terrible. i told my boss i could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. that night on the phone she said yes please work from home. first thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. it is a google chrome timer extension. i told them that i would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but i was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. she said ok, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since i wouldn't install the timer and that i was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

"update: my babies and i escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3am last night... i'm scared, my kids are confused... i don't even know how i feel right now but nothing seems real.. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/av968z/my_babies_and_i_escaped_to_a_shelter_for_victims/

thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. i was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

a little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

the dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. my kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he ""loves his new house"". he asks for daddy nightly saying ""i just want daddy be happy. i just want daddy not be mad any more"" and it breaks my heart but i just tell him i love him and hold him when he is hurting. i realized even being here i am happier than i ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. i don't feel like i'm constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

the shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. my 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and i've seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

they have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. the attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. they are also filing a long term protective order. 

we have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

i will be starting work again next week. my hr manager contacted the store up where i am now to have me transferred because of the situation. i am so thankful the company i work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though i've had to take the last few weeks off while i get things in order. 

the shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on wednesday for both children while i start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. the daycare facility is wonderful and i'm so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while i start work again! 

since i am able to start work again too i was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

i was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. i was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

a detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while i handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. the detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. so, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a class c family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when i was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a class a and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

he has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying i kidnapped the children and also filed a false cps report. i handed over all evidence to cps as well and they immediately closed it saying they ""can tell he is not being honest"" as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. he did text me a few days ago saying we didn't need to get attorneys though and let's just go file a custody agreement, but i didn't respond. if i even let him see the children until things get worked out i risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

his mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to florida so i would never see them again.... 

so, things are moving along. it has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but i've never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. i feel like things are pulling together even faster than i imagined. it's stressful... by the end of the day sometimes i just want to cry still, but it's not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

i hope one day i can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources are available. it's not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what i ever could have imagined and hoped for and i will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing.

"my faith in humanity isn't restored when i see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen. call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. disabled people and bullied people aren't your charity case.. you see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, ""there are still good people in this world. she was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen."" or ""star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate"". sure it seems sweet at first but when i think about it all i can see is someone doing something ""nice"" for their own personal gain. when these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? who gets the interviews and good press? why, the people who did the ""good deed"" of course. most of the time it seems like they don't give a damn about the person who they did something ""nice"" for, instead it's about ""look what we did! we are so nice! we are so good hearted!"" it's all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it's almost never about the person it should be about. it's not sweet and heartwarming, it's almost sort of heartbreaking because i've seen instances where people will do ""nice things"" for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. it was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. if you want to do something nice do it when nobody's looking and don't accept any congratulations for your good deed.

eta: like i said in a reply to a commenter, sure its a ""nice thing to do"" and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it's a nice gesture all around, but disabled people aren't mindless angel pets. they have brains and lots of them don't like to feel pitied or patronized. especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. i'm not saying ""don't ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives"" i am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. also if you're gonna do something nice for someone make sure you're being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. don't be nice one day and then cruel the next. i know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that's not my main issue here. the motive isn't the issue either, it's the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. instead of mistreating someone, doing one ""nice"" thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. my issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. i really don't give that much of a shit about ""prom queen"" or shit like that anyway, i'm using it as an example. i'm almost 20 years old and when i was younger i never ran for those positions anyhow. another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. that way he won't feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. make him feel like he's not a helpless invalid.",6

a little backstory. me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. i blame him for it and he blames me. i won't go into detail here. we ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. while this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. we rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. one thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. and unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. in the 8 years since we've been divorced i have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and i've never given him one of my days even if he begged.

well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. his parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at disneyland and he want's to take the kids. well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. he asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and i shot him down. it's my week with them and i get to spend it with them. i told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that i need to ""think of them"". i told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200b;

well, this last sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. when i asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. when i asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to disneyland"". asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them i was not letting them go to disneyland with him. he's trying to paint me as the bad guy. i sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. my daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

i'm not though. i think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. i demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"".

"by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital nsfw. i'm still trying to process what just happened. today was my daughters 19th birthday and i wanted to surprise her by coming home early with a cake. i brought the cake home, slowly tip-toed to her room to surprise her and heard something i will never unhear. she was having sex with her boyfriend and saying ""please stop it hurts, stop it."" i ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. i was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. i threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. my daughter was frantically explaining to me that it's a fetish and he wasn't actually hurting her. i told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and i rushed him to the hospital. he's doing okay now and isn't suffering any major injuries but i feel awful. i'm not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and i truly thought he was hurting her.

"you don't deserve medical treatment if you don't intend to stop doing the thing that's killing you. i'll preface this by just saying i work for a hospital so i'll keep it simple by giving an example; 

guy smokes a pack a day religiously. guy gets lung cancer. guy has chemo and ends up having a lung removed. guy **continues** to smoke a pack a day with no intention of stopping. i've also seen this in people who have chronic breathing issues because they smoked for many years. they bitch and moan that they can't breath, go to the hospital and use up oxygen tanks and everything else all while refusing to stop doing the thing that is killing them. if you don't wanna change to help your body heal then you shouldn't be allowed any treatment to keep your decrepit body going. this is just one of the simpler examples but that's it in a nutshell.",6
"by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong'. this happened about a week ago. it still gives me shivers.

obviously, i never thought this would happen to me of all people.

i spent a lot of money on the app store and i think they blocked my card and so i had to call them up to restore my account.

a female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. even at this point i had no clue what was coming. until she asked,

""what is your most prized possession?""

i froze. my head goes blank not because i forgot what i had written for the answer, but because i knew exactly what i had written. the answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

i wanted to hang up right then and there, but i knew she was looking at the answer i had written.

so, i mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""i'm sorry? you have to speak up sir, i can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (fuck), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (fucking kill me)""

""dong schlong. thank you, sir.""

i was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

i've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

tl;dr: i wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and i had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

edit:

holy mother of schlong this blew up... thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

"update texas my mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. however, the police is still alive, and when i showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. how can i get my cat back?. link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

hello,

first off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. i didn't feel like advice to steal my cat back was 'legal' (thus, being in this subreddit), so i took one users advice to talk to the director of animal control in my mom's city.

she basically told me that the police have no idea what they're doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. she said that the only thing i can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as 'stolen property'. she said the police will understand what to do if a i reference my cat as 'property' and not an animal.

i went to the police station and the police threw me around again. despite i tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn't 'property'. after 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom's texts. 

the cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, i can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my 'stolen property'.

we get to my mom's house and she's not there. we look around the outside of her house and find no signs of kitty either. i call her and ask her where she is, and told her that i was at her house with the police. she said, in quote, ""i took the cat and ran off into oklahoma and i'm not ever coming back."" 

the police said they can't help me since they don't have jurisdiction in oklahoma. 

i went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so i left because i can't afford it. on my way home, i contacted adult protective services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. so i hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

i also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into oklahoma. my mom played the 'poor me' card, so my family bought into it. and somehow, i'm now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... when i got home, i cut everyone out. all of my family. i separated every single tie i had to them.

i've had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if i'm being open about the situation, i was a victim of childhood abuse. that cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me i won't be able to get him back. i ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now i'm getting help for my own mental health. this situation broke me, and right now, i'm trying to recover.

thank you everyone for listening. 

**tl;dr:** my cat is gone and i'll never get him back.",2
"you should be able to honestly tell your so if they have gained weight to the point of you losing physical attraction towards them and you shouldn't be labelled as a ""bad person / a*hole/ etc"" if you do so.. **tldr** : you should be able to straightforwardly and respectfully express to your so if they gained weight to the point you start losing desire for their body if you both consider sex  and physical attraction vital for your relationship.

**edit - before anything else please read:** 

\- so, let me start by saying i deleted most of my text as those lines don't really serve purpose. they were indeed too long to even consider reading through. 

\- the other thing is: i have to admit that this post was rushed. and yes, i am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). the funny thing is that while i might think some commenters are oversensitive i have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and i can also get oversensitive. i don't regret what i wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. some of you made the assumption that i must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. that's right. and sometimes i turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw i'm female for those who thought otherwise). the reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. i can understand that what i said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). and at the end i'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. i should have considered more factors. i want to apologize about that honestly. so thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now i'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. i'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. so thank you for offering the experience. i appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. i'll try and digest them properly in the following days. i'm still think that i'm right about some aspects but not anymore do i believe my reasoning is flawless. i wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**content:**

honesty is not kindness. honesty is honesty. period. i don't mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn't put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. you can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. if you can't take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. and yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

you can't just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ""soft"") - and how you react to that is your responsibility. the partner doesn't have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it's a sensitive topic to you. i wonder why it's so sensitive…

looks does matter. we have a right to voice what we like and by putting away our own ego we should be more flexible dealing with and communicating it.",6

"today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from. the mystery fence(https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nqdq)

delaware, usa. no homeowners association.

we live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. it's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. there was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). i removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

well i come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. the leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

i don't know who owns it, so i called the real estate agent. he was just as shocked as i was when i told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. he had no idea. he'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. i asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. she didn't.

"for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?. my 19-year old daughter vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they've never don't ever see each other besides a few quick weekend visits. moreover, they've only dated for a little more than a year. 

i told her i was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. but i maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

the problem lies when vanessa asked me for money. you see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, i decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). that combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

since i gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. i told vanessa that i was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

she now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in it). she said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

i told her i cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. if/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, i'll be happy to contribute the money. but it's not just a free handout.

she's got really mad that i rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. to her credit, her brother and i have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while vanessa was more the troublemaker), but i do love my children equally. i told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiance, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. that if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, i will fully support it financially.

well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. my wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but i told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and i rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and when she has to move back home. i don't want her to think i support this decision.

she told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my vanessa, she's staying out of it. i, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. for sticking to my guns on this?",3

"for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?. a few months ago, my brother and now sil announced their intention to marry. the invitation to the wedding stated ""no dress code. wear whatever is comfortable for you."" in hindsight, i think they put that there since the event was at a lake. i didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, i should dress respectably for such an occasion, and i have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. i chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

yesterday was the wedding. when i showed up, i noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than i was. i'm talking polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. i did feel a little out of place. my brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my sil was wearing a modest white dress. the only comment i got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying i looked like i'm marrying the sil, but that was it.

a few hours ago, i got a call from sil. holy shit, she is pissed at me! she was asking why i dressed like a pimp, i upstaged her and my brother, and i stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. i referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and i was dressing respectfully. she was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. i told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. she asked if i was that retarded. i told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. i hung up. she spammed my phone with calls, so i blocked her and texted my brother i'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

was i in the wrong?

edit: clarified she said i stuck out on the photos.

edit 2: my brother said i'm welcome to come over for dinner later. i unblocked her number. no call spam, so that's a good sign.

edit 3: had dinner with my brother and sil earlier. she showed me the pictures, and i can kind of see what she was talking about. i told her i'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because i did notice i was out of place and i should have tried to do something. she said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. so yeah, i don't think we're gonna be on jerry springer as far as i can tell.",3

the doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so i'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived.

tldr: my family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

i think rm is crazy and needs a mh checkup. seriously. i am very worried for her wellbeing. 

my mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. i told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. my mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

when my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. i've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
my mom called rm and rd and r to come over to talk. they came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. she made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and i could tell this was pissing rm off. some points of the confrontation:

1. why are you calling my daughter these names?
rm: i didn't say anything. she's making        up lies. 

2. why are you even in the apartment that much? you told us that you go there once a month to check on r. you also said she visits you every weekend?
rm: the kids don't know how to cook, so i help. also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. why are you going through my daughter's stuff? why does she need a lock? why are you limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*i shall also mention that roommate's dad was sitting in their car on the driveway during this whole confrontation*

but things got heated up really quickly. rm started insulting my parents:

- she said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said i am unruly and that the clothes i wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). this annoyed my brother, and he showed rm ig pictures of r wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. rm shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- she then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""god complexes"". this pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" this pushed rm off the edge, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted to slap him. 

this lady tried to slap my 24 y/o brother in front of my parents. 

they argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. this time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. she came back to where we were standing and literally threw the dress in my face.

my mom had no more patience left, and back slapped rm across her face. i've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and i burst out laughing. even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of rm. rm started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

when they left we had a big discussion:

my parents were angry that i never told them about this before. they said that they got me that apartment so i could do what i wanted. they wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
however, they are very proud and happy with the way i dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. thank you all for the advice. i appreciate it alot. ❤

they were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of r cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

my parents agreed that letting r live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. my parent's started the eviction process today. 

anyways, it may be hard to believe, but i do stand up for myself a lot. it's just that in this situation, i didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because i had respect for their friendship and i didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. i learned from this, and i have growing up to do, but now that i know i have support, i won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

i also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't indian). no one is living rent free in this situation. 

i would also like to say that even though i wasn't friends with r in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

also my parents are liberal ass indians. they have lived here in america for over 40 years. they didn't want to spy on me at all. they don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

edit 1: i forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, i don't think it does. i'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. also, it's my parent's money. they'll do what they want. this gives me no excuse to have a gpa less than a 4.0, js. 

edit 2: i took out the part where rm tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  it was funny though. 

edit 3: i added a tldr. 

i included most of the important points. if something doesn't make sense i'll reply in the comments. 

the cops are yet to show up.

"my parents chose their new families over me so i moved in with my aunt. now they want back in. but i hate them. hi.

so i 16. moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

my father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. my mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

after all that i became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that i didn't exist and play happy family.

after a year i became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home i would never interact with anyone. both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. i wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon i was labeled as the black sheep of the family. every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. i was just so fed up that i packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. i took a bus and went mia for 4 days. ofcourse the police was called and when i appeared again i hit another lecture.

we got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and i told them i hated them. i called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

in the car i could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. we informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

my parents ways half assed our contact. appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. recently they tried to build more contact up but i was not interested.

i won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did i invite them to the celebration. and on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. i didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. basically i have cut them out of my life.

i am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. she got upset and called me crying and..... i just didn't care. it was like listening to a tv character cry. it wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again i didn't care.

as far as i am concerned my aunt is my only parent. she encourages that i build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. they tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and i just said no and left. i still resent them for choosing a new life over me. but i don't know if i am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. i don't want them in my life but would i be making the right choice? ""idk

edit : because people think o just made it up and i am a moody teen

you know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? that was the feeling i constantly had at their houses.

i know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. my parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. but not in the sense ""i want to have her longer"" but ""i took her last weekend! it's your turn"".

also planing fun activities for the day after i leave. my father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. they had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

they shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

when there are family functions i am often excludes. e.g my dad had a family bbq and didn't invite me 

they forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar starbucks gift card even when they know i don't like starbucks. 

so no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",8

"by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp. technically yesterday and not today, but yifu sounds like some odd anime genre so...

so it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. i was dropping her off at about 8ish and i was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. for the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

anyway, stopped at the summer camp. my daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. i signed my daughter in and then i.... just drove off. in my defense, well, i got nothing. honestly, i just forgot the dog there.

so my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. i now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). she also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. she got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. all in all, could have gone worse.

edit - i get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  sorry, but no can do.  pics include other people's kids and i'm not going to post that.  also, i think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and i've said way too much shit i regret on reddit for that to happen.  just use your imaginations.  she's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  she's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

edit 2 - for those asking.  yes, camp called me.  twice.  and left vm's both times.  number was not one i recognized so i didn't pick up or check vm (i know, tifu!  number is now programmed in).  both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if i could come pick the dog up.  i clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  and yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  huge huge props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

edit 3 - for those asking.  i did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  so i left them an awesome review on yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

edit 4 - yah, i get it.  this could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  yes, it was a mistake on my side.  that's why i'm posting it here and not on r/todayiwasawesome

edit 5 - holy crap.  came back to see this hit the front page and my inbox has 500 messages.  i just want to take a moment and say thank you to my mom and dad for having sex with each other and making this moment possible.  

tl;dr - dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. dog had a great time and i think she's now a camp counselor.",4

so for this year, i posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my fb. it was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). i wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""i'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who i am. i hope you are proud of me.""

a few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. she asked if i  loved her or if i wanted to get a divorce. she told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my fb. of course i love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so i felt guilty and took down the post. was i out of line here? i genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, i just wanted people to know what a great person my late-gf was.",3

we have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. no matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

essentially...
- if i try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if i am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

"my wife tried to hide my daughter from me. am i wrong to feel this angry?. my wife and i are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

when i was in my 20s i donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (i literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). i've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. always. and she has always said she's okay with it.

fast forward to yesterday i answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" obviously i have no idea what the fuck is going on, so i ask her to explain what she's talking about.

turns out this girl is my daughter (i understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when i didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. after turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. she called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. apparently my wife told her that i wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman i loved could be so fucking heartless. so for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when i was home.

i tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that i did not say any of that. we organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night i blew up at her. honestly, i've never yelled at anyone as long as i can remember, but i couldn't hold it in.

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r12hs/pa_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and_threatens_to


my post was not hugely popular, but i have a small update. thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, i read all of them, even the ones i didn't reply to immediately.

i called the police last night. an officer came out to my house, he read the messages, saw the photos, and said, ""yeah that's illegal and i don't think it gets much easier to prosecute than this."" he had my fiance send him screenshots of everything and then the photos separately. he took my ex's information, our information, and the surprisingly ample amount of information i have on his girlfriend. 

my ex is currently on both probation and parole, so the officer is reaching out to his po today for a current address since he refused to provide it to me. he'll be calling my ex today, and if he hangs up on him or gets smart, he'll be prepared with an address to just go talk to him. he also knows where he is working this evening while the officer is on duty, so that is a last resort.

he is also going to run the evidence and our statements by the da's office today and get the green light to proceed with charges, which apparently will include an actual arrest once everything that needs to happen happens. i'm not clear on the details exactly, i just know that they are almost certainly going to be charging him with a misdemeanor 2. 

additionally, i am almost positive that my ex's current girlfriend, who he has been with for roughly 9 months now, was involved in some manner. she is an rn, so if it comes to light that she was complicit, she could also be charged and lose her job. i don't know how it would impact her license as an rn, but i did work for the hospital she works for currently, and any charges, no matter how minor, result in termination. the officer confirmed this, as well. 

and i took everyone's advice - i contacted my attorney. he is drafting a cease and desist letter to send to both my ex and his current partner. he is also going to request a copy of the police report to add to the already massive stack of evidence of reasons why he should not get custody of either of his kids, he should remain strictly on visitation, if he's lucky enough to even get that.

thank you everyone, i have a small amount of hope that this will work out favorably. my current partner doesn't care what he has to say or what pictures he sends, he sees it every day. he also knows that my ex is vindictive and is grasping at straws in an adult temper tantrum. hopefully this will end the years of this crap from my ex, as this is not the first partner he has done this with. it's just finally a charge in pa!",2
"by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging. happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

i was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. i noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

normally, i wouldn't think twice about it, but i was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

we pull up to a stop light, and i hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. apparently he didnt see me, because when i said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, i let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

as i turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. the way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

as i'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. it didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

she then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as i'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. the way she viewed it, i was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

the cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

tl;dr i stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

"if your are ""literally shaking"" from the recent national tragedies, but you have no direct affiliation with the victims, you need to get over yourself.. i have seen a few overly dramatic people on twitter and reddit going on about how they are ""literally shaking"" from the recent spree of mass shooting attacks.

while those attacks are worth a long in depth civil discussion by itself, if you aren't directly affiliated with the victims, you need to get a grip with yourself and stop making everything about you.

like you are taking national tragedies, and making it about yourself. if it bothers you that much, get off your ass and speak to your local lawmakers.

it just really annoys the shit out of me. like i may like guns, but at least i respect anyone calling for action against guns. that's action. you're voicing a stance, and that's good. 

you saying ""omg, i'm literally shaking"" is just fucking worthless reaction to tell anyone.

very classy. you're mad about me saying anything about these attacks, but you realize the recent orlando attack was a gay nightclub, right? is that irony lost on you when calling me a ""faggot""? 

otherwise, thank you for the mostly civil discussion, even if you really disagree with me. only a few people grossly misunderstood me. i also do have empathy for innocent people getting slaughtered minding their own business, but i don't have room for people seeking attention over something that has little to do with them.

"i (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. idk what to do anymore.. i'm posting because i cannot share this with my family and i can't talk to my friends either.

wife and i have been married for 4 years, together for 12. last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. my brother was my hero. he was there for me when my parents abandoned us. he was there for me when i struggled with depression. he's like a father figure to me. 

so my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. he told me that it was very important. we met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. he told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. and he also started suspecting it. i was really shocked by this revelation. because my wife never told me about this. and i never imagined she would cheat on me.

but when i confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. she didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. but my brother claims it was consensual. 

we ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. i just want to kill myself. my brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

i'm really torn. i don't think my brother is a rapist. but i'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. also, she never told me this. she had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. idk what to do now. i think i'm just leaving. but i want some advice to cope up.",8

"by chuckling away being overpaid.. obligatory ""this concluded today"" - i've been working for uncle sam for about 7 years now. i'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day i received a letter from dfas (the guys who actually pay us) that i was overpaid two whole cents.

silly i thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which i could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, the man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - it was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

laughing it off i taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom i work for and why i should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you f-35), and forgot about it. a month later, two weeks ago i get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address xxxxx, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

now i'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before i ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now i'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. being the class a humorous guy that i am, i send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, i kunted et al myself. i lobe me job."" covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

this was a bad play because apparently feds have no sense of humor.

two weeks later, one week ago i got called into my officer's office. not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, i was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

i'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""me, mind explaining to me why i received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, they spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so i thought i'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. patriotism, y'know sir?""

""well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - we need these floors clean for reason and were looking for a class a go-getter to clean them.

apparently captains have no sense of humor either.

"by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.. this came to a head on sunday night. i've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. she would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. this was fine for a few weeks. then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. i dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. that this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. i wouldnt know.

my mind jumps to affair. the love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. i figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. i basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. she declined, said maybe when she gets back. like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. so i follow her. there is a dennys down the road from our house. she gets out and goes in. im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. i go inside and i cant find her. nowhere to be seen. its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. she finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""how can you do this to me!"" the fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. my wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""you're caught, where is the guy?."" ""what?"" ""dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""there isnt a guy."" ""why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" at this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. in the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""i had to use the bathroom."" uncontrolled sobbing. ""what....you had to what?"" ""i had to go to the bathroom."" ""we have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""i dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""a dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. i just never noticed, never second guessed it. she stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. so many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. her  shame was brought down by bananas. i could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. so, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

tl;dr my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

"by swallowing my little sister's birthday present. i am so beside myself with shame that i almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

but reddit karma is my mistress and i must heed her sweet call. 

so yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), i was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

now, i cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. i looked at that ring in my hand and i just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a bugs bunny cartoon. my primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

so i did it.

i think it was the next split second when i saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that i realized what a horrible mistake i had made. 

so my little sister runs screaming from my room and i hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as i admitted that i, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. no, i didn't know why i did it. yes, i am an idiot. no one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

so brief intermission from my sister's birthday as i make a quick excursion to the er, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them i was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. they took a couple x-rays and i hung around the er for about 8 hours before they broke the news that i was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

i shat out the ring this morning. 

happy birthday sis.

"girlfriend was arrested w/ a dui but blew a .06!!! cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!. so..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. she didn't drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. when the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). on her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. a minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. she admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

this is when it gets interesting. 

the officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. he then declared that she was drunk without having her blow to test her bac, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

then, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! that's below the legal limit (we are in wyoming). and the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her bac was. 

my question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? we have no money and probably can't afford a good lawyer. i could barely afford her bail. she is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn't deter her from pursuing her dream. 

any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. we have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn't tell her the miranda rights (found out he doesn't need to)


edit: thank you all so much for the help

"for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   i've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. you can skip to the tl;dr if the exposition is too long.

she's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which i honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. she can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

if you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' when someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(it doesn't stop there, she knew i had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as i walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. it's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

that's not it, either. she *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, bam, i'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

it's gotten to the point where i don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, i've saved up more being with her than i ever had in any other relationship. the only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

our anniversary was recently, and i had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so i suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""i'm not learning how to make sushi because then i'll *never* get a real date ever again."" we ended up going out instead.

it kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. she's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like olive garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that i'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because i've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

she also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste i've ever seen so i kinda think it's just an excuse.

i just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

tl;dr: so, reddit, am i the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because i practically have a private chef of my very own?

edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, i just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

edit 2: i'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. i'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

edit3: no, twitter, i don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. i buy her herbs and succulents. what flowers do i buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

also, yes, i wash the dishes

#final edit:

okay guys. this will probably be my last edit. this post exploded unexpectedly and i've tried to respond to as many comments as i can, but there's just too many of you. if you've asked me a direct question and i haven't answered, i'm sorry. my inbox is a mess.

i really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and i can honestly say that i've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. it's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

so her mom picked up the girls and i took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. she was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and i apologized for being stupid. after, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so i asked her to marry me.

she said no. she did it kindly, but she still said no. she said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

i'm pretty heartbroken. i thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

so, reddit, you were all right. i'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

"for not paying for the extra meal i accidentally ordered at a wedding?. my sixteen year old son and i went to a wedding. when we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. there was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but i never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. i sent in the rsvp card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

at the wedding, my son and i got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. the waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. the waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

i later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that i had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. i told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. they said i should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that i should have asked for clarification if i wasn't sure. but i wasn't unsure, i never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. ten and under i would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up i would never think would have a kid's meal. the bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but i've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. i think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

if i refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? i know wedding meals are expensive, but i think this was their mistake.",3

"by putting a rock in my ear, then leaving it for roughly 13 years.. bit of context; i was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. i'm 26 now. 

well it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and i had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. it's where i got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?

while i sat amongst rubble and dirt, i had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.

again, i wasn't bright. 

well. i drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.

that said, i flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly i can't remove it. not a single adult was even aware i was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.

so when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.

i lost my mind.

my dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. whatever really.

either way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that i was overreacting.

okay. sure.

let's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and i'm in highschool.

this is where the real fun begins. equalbrium (equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. i could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. was a nightmare, really.

i get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that ""imaginary rock"" i had long ago forgotten.

all i hear is scrapes.

scrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.

i'll admit, i immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. that's another topic entirely.

well wouldn't you know, though? the doctor said i was faking, examined my ear, and said i just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. right. it was probably june at the time.

my mom didn't really believe him, but i decided ""balls to it. let's get some hydro-perox!"", because fuck hospitals really.

skip along the years a bit more, i'm 18 and i know for a fact there is something in-my-fucking-head. i'm losing it. so i hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, ""there's definitely blockage. i'm not sure if it's a rock, but i can certainly try to help.""

so this professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of scissor-hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. it was audio torture, hands down. rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.

the end results? ""you'll need to see a specialist"", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.

i'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.

the sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and i began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when i reflect back.

let's time jump one last time. i'm 22, couple months away from 23, i have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. great.

but now, out of the blue, i'm losing hand-eye coordination. well damn, you know? i attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.

i lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that i could dig this chunk of earth out myself.

three different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. but that last one was phased from the situation immediately.

this was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and i locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.

eventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. in an instant i froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.

jackpot.

now, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.
the pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like i was passing a kidney stone from my skull.

all in all, 2/10. wouldn't do again.

but now it's totally out and i have it put away in a ziplock bag.

i had no real recovery issues i guess. as soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. now it just rings occasionally.

my balance won't ever be the same i feel, but it's fine enough as is. otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, i have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and i get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.

not a bad trade out.

"by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral. this happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time, and i was having a pretty bad day, i was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. if youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so i do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....then i here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so i wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so i pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, i take down his number so i can repay him later on. at this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months. my auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon.
my son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

tl;dr got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and i somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

"obgyn will not stop calling my dad to confirm appointments, even though i'm 22 (. (using a throwaway in case my dad reddits, would prefer him not to find my account)

in indiana

i'm in grad school, but still go to the same obgyn in my home town, out of familiarity and convenience. i was planning to switch once i finished school and settled down. i have him listed as my emergency contact. 

for some reason, they keep calling him to confirm my appointments, despite me telling them three times to never call that number and to please call my cell phone instead. things came to a head yesterday when they called to confirm my appointment for an ultrasound and he cancelled it without my knowledge.  

(my father and i have a tenuous relationship, but that's not related to this situation. i will also be switching docs asap)

this has to be a hipaa violation, right? i can't imagine they're not doing the same thing to other women. this could get someone seriously hurt, if they were seeking birth control or anything behind the back of an abusive parent/spouse. 

tl;dr obgyn keeps calling emergency contact for appointment confirmation instead of my personal number. worried it could get someone in a more vulnerable than me hurt",2

"by labeling the breast milk in the fridge ""freshly squeezed titty juice"". the repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.

my wife and i have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment it came out.  we found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

while i was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  that rest was very short lived.  the baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

when she read ""freshly squeezed titty juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  she woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  raised with no manners or respect.  she then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

my wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  she passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

i didn't get upset because i'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

tl;dr  i labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  now i have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks i embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days.",4

"my fiance took my birth control pills and stabbed holes into condoms to try and get me pregnant.. i'm in my late 20s and i got engaged for my fiance (29) who i've been with for 9 years. our relationship has never really been tested and we get on really well. but recently he brought up that he wants kids. i said no i'm not ready and probably won't be for a few years. he got really mad and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes. i just moved on from it and didn't give it a second thought. 

a week later i couldn't find my birth control pills, they are usually in the bathroom cupboard but i couldn't find them anywhere. later that night he wanted to have sex, i said i couldn't find my bc pills and he said it's alright he'll use a condom, i supposed that was alright so he went and got one from the bathroom. for the next few weeks we just used a condom and i didn't take the pill. in hindsight i should have got more when i couldn't find the original pack but i couldn't be bothered (my fault) 

on a few occasions we were having sex i noticed the condom was split, he clearly noticed all times and didn't say anything so i said stop. the next day i was putting the recycling in the trash, as i was putting it in i seen my pills at the bottom. i instantly knew he had binned them. he knows i deal with the trash so why we he be so stupid to just put them in recycling. 

it all made sense so i confronted him about the pills and condoms and he couldn't answer me. he just kept walking away. i was so mad at him, it's not right. you can't just force someone to be pregnant just because you want a baby. does he have to carry it for 9 months?

"for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?. i'm 19f and live at home with my family. my younger brother 'mike' is 14. he is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. the boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. they have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. my mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""i saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""they were in our garden 5 minutes ago i think now they're headed to the skate park"". i think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

one of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'jake' is there. we once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
now yesterday i was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. jakes mom had called my phone two times but i didn't answer cause she was annoying me. my boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. we were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. it was all nice and peaceful and suddenly i hear a really loud knock. it really made us jump because it was just so sudden. i turn to look and there's jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. i nearly hit the ceiling i was so angry. i go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt i just wanted to ask because i haven't seen jake in almost two hours ect.ect. apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. i really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. i also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

my boyfriend thought i was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. she also thinks i shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  i feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but i feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",3

we were alone and i just asked if she loved me. i called her mom for first time in months. i wanted to know what her feelings for me really are. i just ranted to her without letting her speak. how i needed her attention and it's affecting me. i played sports just for her attention and so that she would be proud of my achievements. i asked her why she wouldn't attend my awards ceremonies or attend parents nights at school. i would stay out late just so that she would call me. i flipped and told her she should have never had me. i fucked up.

i made my mom cry that night.

she told me that she did love me. 

she revealed that she was raped by my dad. he was her boyfriend at the time but she didn't consent. she became depressed and carried me full term. she is still recovering from her depression. my grandparents wanted her and i to be raised as siblings, in order for her to continue with her life. at first she tried to be a mother but it was really difficult raising me. this is why she has been distant from me. she doesn't know if she wants to be my mom or act as my sister. in the end she just gave up. i remind her of her rapist but she knows that i am gentle and kind. i didn't know what to say, i just hugged her. it was a hard truth to swallow. i told her that i will always be there for her. she told she didn't know i was hurting inside. i told her we can start again from scratch.

my mom joked that i scare away her boyfriends and she loves my cooking. i cried as i went to sleep. i can't blame her anymore and i should make a better effort to be more involved with her. i want to support her. i'm not going to break off contact with her. i going to try and persuade her to join me in getting some family therapy.

"update: i just recieved a demand letter from enterprise rent-a-car stating that if i do not return their rental car, i will be charged with embezzlement and grand theft auto. i never rented a car from them. (san jose, california). thank you to everyone for the advice. i'm also a she by the way (many of you thought i was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

after my initial post, i saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because enterprise is the one at fault and i shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. so i did exactly this, and she told me that id i want her to give me more info, i would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that i am not the person who rented the car.  if not, she would report me for embezzlement and grand theft to the sacramento police. upon hearing this, i decided to file a report immediately online with the san jose police department. i know many of you said i shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, i did not want to take any chances where i could end up with a warrant on my head.  i thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  after filing it, i emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  when i spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that i was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

on may 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. she showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had my information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with cash. (i thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) the manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the sacramento police later that afternoon. the following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as fraud, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  at this point, i was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. i then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to sacramento see who the hell this woman is. however, turns out i didn't have to because 2 hours later...  
  
  
  
the san jose police did show up knocking on my front door. ( 2 policemen and 2 chp officers) before opening it, the first thing i did was grab the copy of the police report i printed because i seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). when i open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if name of woman i do not know lives at my home? i tell them no, and that i have no idea who that is,  then they ask if i am alymg and i tell them that i am. they then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of fremont that morning. the accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. they then show the license to me and it's an exact replica of my drivers license, and i ask them how this is possible if i have my license in my wallet? they then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (the black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) i then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when i hand them my report. i explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from enterprise.  so basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. i told the officers that i have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. i then asked them who is the name of the woman i do not know and they told me that she is the who stole the car. however, i'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we do not look a-like at all. idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. but after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

i do have her name now though, and after doing a google search i found her facebook and other social media accounts. i'm very tempted to message her but i've decided to leave this to the police because i have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she does know where i live) however, i do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

"by making a grown man cry at my work. i debated whether or not this belongs here cause it's more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. but my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

sidenote: this happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

i work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. i had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. he was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes i get who tend to speak down to me just because i'm a girl who works in a hardware store. anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so i said i could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. he agrees and he opens his wallet and i notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. trying to make conversation i decide to comment on it:
(op: me | og: old guy)

op: oh is that your granddaughter? she's so cute!

og: oh no... that's my daughter.

*fuck, i basically just implied this guy was old.*

og: oh cool! she's really cute! what grade is she in?

*guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

og: she's dead. she was hit by a car. a week after the picture was taken 

in my mind i fucking panicked. i literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. and this is what i came up with:

op: oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! it's too bad she died!

the guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. in record time i get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""have a nice day!"" and he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

guys. 

i told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

and that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" that's what my fucking brain came up with. 
fml.

tl;dr - subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**update: holy shit.**

i did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

to answer a few comments: 
*why didn't you just say 'i'm sorry' and move on?*

because that would of been the smart thing to say and as i have referenced, i am a complete and utter dumbass. also, i am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so i was trying to backpeddle as fast as i could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*why would you comment on the kids picture? that's weird.*

yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. but like i said i am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. this happened when i was still pretty new to the job and i had never worked in retail before so i wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. after this happened i learned my lesson and i have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*why do you work in customer service? you clearly don't belong in that department.*

like i said this happened a few years ago when i was still pretty new and i have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. i now train people for the job and i am also a assistant supervisor of the department. i usually tell newbies this story when i am training them so they don't make the same mistake as i did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*did you ever apologize to the guy?*

no, and that's the one thing i regret most of all. i've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. i truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. while i'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

&#x200b;

i don't know what the hell has happened but things have turned into an absolute clusterfuck.

i received some really great advice from people and honestly thought talking to him was going to work out well. i was still pretty nervous though and not sure how to bring it up. his mood has been pretty touch and go lately so i was worried about picking the right moment and kept putting it off until later in the night when he tried initiating sex and i thought that was a good time to start the conversation.

i basically said i know you've noticed something's been off lately and thats because i haven't been entirely comfortable during sex since you got your new tattoo. i absolutely love it for what it is and what it stands for but it's just difficult for me to stay in the moment because it's really hard not to look at it and be reminded of what happened. i stopped here to see what his reaction would be so far and he was just silent for awhile and then said ""so... what? you want me to get rid of him?""

i ***explicitly*** said ""no i would never ask you to do that"" and then told him it might just take me some time to get used to it until its not so noticeable anymore and in the meantime maybe he could keep his shirt on during sex or we could try some other ideas. this is where shit started to hit the fan. he said all that sounded ridiculous to him and that i was being extremely insensitive and selfish and ""honestly sick' for even associating his little brother with sex and asked if i was fucking sick in the head.

i fucked up here. i shouldn't have said this but i don't handle confrontation well and i pretty much lost my cool at this point. i told him to go jack off to a picture of his brother and tell me how that makes him feel. he completely exploded at this point saying that was a disgusting thing to say (i agree) and started calling me a number of names. he then started to get extremely personal saying i never cared about his little brother and that i'm probably happy he's out of the picture.

that is hand down the most hurtful thng he has ever said to me. i still cant bellieve it and i don't think i'm ever going to forgive hm for that. like seriously what the fuck? just thinking about it is makng me fucking shake. he knows exactly how i feel about his brother and how hard his death was for both of us and for him to stil say something like that? he can seriously go fuck himself because i'm definitely not gonna be doing it anymore.

he then started shoutng that if it was seriously that big of a deal for me that he would get the whole thing layered off but he hopes i know i'm basically killing his brother all over again??? i was crying so much at this point i didn't get a chance to respond before he stormed out of the house and just took off. i have no idea where he's gone or where he is and i honestly don't even know if i care at this point. he's not answering his phone or responding to any messages.

i still can't believe he reacted the way he did. he was like a completely different person. not once in the four years i've know him out of all the arguments we've had has he ever spoken to me like that before. i was up all night on the phone to my sister and she was just as shocked as i was.

then this fucking morning i get a lovely fucking call from my boyfriend's sister who called me disgusting and heartless and evil for forcing him to remove the tattoo. apparently he's been going around to his family and alllour friends telling them i've given him an ultimatum of me or his tattoo.

what the fuck?!?! i explicitly told him i would never ask him to do that. when i told his sister this she just called me a lying fucking bitch, wished all my siblings dead and then hung up. feckin lovely.

i seruiously don't know why he's reacted the way he has or why he's going around lying about me making him get rid of it. i'm still in total shock and just so confused. i hoped typing all this out would help me figure things out a little but reading this over has just made me angrier. i don't see what i could have done differently? i shouldn't have made the jack off comment, that's clearly what set him off but that doesn't explain why he's lying now to everyone.

i'm just at a complete loss right now. a day ago i thought of this guy as my future husband and now i just don't know. i wish i never said anything.

i've spent four years of my life with this guy but this is a side of him i've never seen before. im so upset right now my imeddiate thought is to just cut things off completely. how the fuk would we even move froward from this? am i the one in the wrong here for the comment i made? i know i shouldn't have said it but i personally think he completely overreacted to it. and how am i supposed to convince our friends he's the one lying here? anything i sy is just going to sound like i'm lying in response to their negative reactions. i seriously have no idea what im supposed to do here. i feel like this is going to ruin my life.

"by wearing a halloween costume to school. this is a case of me being a chronic dumbass.

i thought that because it was halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but nope!

not a soul.

nobody wore or did anything to celebrate. i know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion i spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. i'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state i'm only at school like 50% of the time, and i thought ""maybe this time i can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy halloween.

its safe to say i was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if i see someone else with a costume on i might feel better but this was overkill, i'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that i likely wont be made fun of but costuming will always be my passion and someday i will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

eta: sorry guys no baby tax. i'm not comfortable posting photos on a public forum, especially with some creeps and assholes on here.

wow i'm an idiot i should absolutely update what happened at the wedding sorry i got that mommy brain

she still wanted everyone to wear black, but she did go lax on style. so like, kind of a redemption arc? the photos look nice, if not a little dreary. she thought black would make things look classy. she looked beautiful tho so mission accomplished.",3
"for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?. my sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  i was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. she got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. she said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so i can see how long it takes her if i want to know so badly. so, i did. i got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later i was done. i guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what i did in half an hour.  she once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine i lied about how long it takes because i hate cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

"update i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. hey folks.

in proper internetiquette, i'd like to first say thank you to the community for your incredible response to what was a really bad day. i received so much support, constructive criticism, advice, and just genuine human connection. your concern, discernment, thoughtfulness... this is one of the best reasons for the internet to exist. even your scorn, some of you. i'm a big believer in ripping off the band-aid, and ya'll really let me have it. but when i said before that i wanted to take all of it in, i meant it. i intend to walk away from this situation a better person than before. tl;dr at bottom.

to the meat and potatoes: **i got my money back.** it wasn't as difficult as some of you feared. it was a simple text exchange yesterday, no heavy words. i also got a thank you from the newlyweds separately. i was surprised by the bride, but i welcomed it. you should welcome all positivity. i said my congratulations again and moved on with my life. i feel like, thanks to you all, i explored every thread in the tapestry of how i should feel and what i could say. it brought a well-measuredness to my thinking that otherwise would have taken maybe months to come by. you saved me from miles of tortured internal dialogue during my daily commute. you saved me from rash actions and words i wouldn't have been able to take back.

i know some of you will wish i went off. but i want peace, and what's the metaphor? bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity? i just don't need that kind of negativity in my life and what i'm trying to say is, i know now that i was just as responsible for how terrible an experience i had. this isn't a self-blame thing, i'm not being low-self esteem. the fact of the matter is, i could have said no, and i could have established a pattern of saying ""no"" to things prior to this that would not have led me to being treated the way i was treated. from so many of you i've learned that this is called self-worth. self-worth would not have seen me say endlessly, ""sure.""

don't get me wrong. i still 100% believe that if someone asks you to do something on their wedding day that you can do without undue burden to yourself, you should do that thing. it's their wedding day. and this goes double for people you're very close to. but you should also know your own limits, and you should teach those limits to others in how you allow yourself to be treated. and yeah, i accept that some of the things asked of me that day, in the context of being very close friends, seemed really shitty, and it felt that way. but from the moment the last groomsmen invitation went out, i should have reassessed the relationship. measured my value without the context of groom's friendship and focused on that.

i think part of the reason why i took so much on was to prove that, even in the face of being called unworthy, i could stand tall as the good friend and person i know i am. maybe some small part of me thought i could prove to the bride that i was someone she should have always counted on. show the groom how a groomsmen should be. this was foolish in a lot of ways, and it ended up costing me all of this torment. you should do good things not to prove a point, but because it adds value to the world. this can be done in a way that doesn't eat you from the inside. i know this now.

so what's the plan from here vis-a-vis my relationship with my friend? i think he made that clear. if i was so important to groom, i'd have been by his side that day, but i'm not so important, and so i wasn't. this is fine. it was his decision, and i told him myself the day he told me i was originally on the roster, ""no matter what anyone says, you need to choose the people who will get you down that aisle."" it's not the place of anyone else to judge his choices. certainly not me. not anymore. ultimately, this means i maintain a respectful distance, but will emphasize the distance. i have no intention of chasing after others to be in my life. when you find the right people, there is no chase. and one day, i'll let him know why he's the usher at my wedding. i don't think that's vindictive more than it is reciprocation. we won't have hella cursive name cards.

i want to impress upon you, if you are still reading this, that you have been part of my evolution. i was already in a place of growth and recovery and building, and god damn if this experience and your input wasn't a hell of a step towards becoming a better me. i'm not going to be a doormat, but i'm also not going to be fucking heartless. if people need help and i can help, i will. i'll just love myself better by knowing when to stop. i know that i'm a good friend, and a great person, and i'm not going to let my mistakes, or anyone else's, change that.

i know that i still have my problems and i'm working through them, and if, when reading my experience, you felt a bit of yourself in me, i want to encourage you: i used to be so self-conscious about myself, i'd sit down with my knees pressed inward and and my arms crossed tight because i didn't want anyone to notice how much space my fatness took up. i used to think that the only reason women smiled at me was because they were politely hoping i'd go away. i used to think that, to have friends and be accepted, you had to give them every bit of value you possess. i'm not that guy anymore, even if the wedding proved that i still have old tendencies, and if you're going through something like this, you can change, too.

i mentioned i was always an overweight person, but i should also say that i've lost 122lbs to date and i'm going to keep going (my goal is another 50lbs). at my average weekly rate, i'll hit my goal in less than six months. if you're struggling similarly, i want you to know that you can do it (dm for emotional weight loss support, please no essential oil pitches). also, this was supposed to be a thing where i counterpoint each of the previously stated insecurities in the above paragraph with some stark successes, but tbh women i'm in to still don't seem romantically interested in me, or i can't tell if they are (dm your relationship tips on how to figure this mystery out), but i'm not so insecure about it anymore. i know that when women smile at me, it's because i made a really bad pun and their better senses betrayed the smile. finally, and this is key, i know who my friends are, and i know that i never had to do anything but be my fucking self and they'd gravitate towards me (you might be thinking of a fat joke here, don't). i know that my real friends asked why i was working the wedding. they asked not why, but how in the hell wasn't i the best man, let alone not be in the wedding party. they tried to get me to stand up and dance when they noticed i was down. they invited me in to pictures. they said they wished i'd had a better time. they commiserated with me the morning after the wedding. they told me, in no uncertain words, that they appreciated how i go above and beyond for people. they told me that, at some point, i have to ask myself if doing this was worth overspending myself. focus on these kinds of people in your life.

you'll have your lingering questions about this. i'm sorry that this post became more of a introspective reflection rather than going in to more details about the wedding drama, of which, naturally, there was no shortage. if you have more questions, ask them and i'll answer. if you have more advice, i'm all ears.

i just want to close with this: so many of you offered to be my friend, and i want to live up to that. the heaviness i felt was lifted, message by message, in your every positive thought and shared painful experience. you helped me feel not alone. i want this to be the standard for everyone moving forward. please, treat each other like good friends. if you are ever down, if you ever want advice, if you need to hear an embarrassing life story to bring levity to your situation (my life story is filled with movie-level embarrassment) please dm this account. i'm here for you.

&#x200b;

tl;dr i got my money back, i learned a thing or two, i'm your friend.

"(update) school kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. lawyers are expensive.... original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

the past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. now i can't go into a lot of the details after but i can go over some of the details that happened during.

we contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. we first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. so he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which i thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

he spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. during this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

so our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. the lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

now i can't go into a lot of the details but i can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. i just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. we are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school.",2

"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?. necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

&#x200b;

edit: while it is nice to know that i'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". i disagree as it was not my intent and i never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. he's also very mad about being called an asshole. while he is my son, i find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. i'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",3

"meta at any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.. this seems like a really weird meta post, but i just wanted to warn people that captain sparklez, a youtuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole trails episode talking about this sub. it's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

it seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. the thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

this isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. honestly i knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds i know to this day. but it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

i *am* the asshole, i already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. sorry, teenagers, but i kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. i wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but i would also be looking at their advice differently if i knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

just be careful everyone. and please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. this doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes."" i just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",3

thanks for the help!

she ended up taking me to court. her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before i even met her, and she married me knowing it). her lawyer claimed otherwise, that i had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. this was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as i had email communications with her acknowledging my record. she insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

she dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. he was a decent guy. ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. it's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

"my boyfriend (21m) hates my (20f) vagina with a passion. i recently became sexually active with my boyfriend and he told me that sex feels very pleasurable but he doesn't like my vagina. he said it just looks unappealing and he doesn't wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. he gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so i didn't push him to continue until i finished and i said he could stop. he doesn't like fingering me either. he basically just said that he doesn't like looking at it or anything. he said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

so i thought i had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. my inner labia are not long or stick out and i'm an innie or whatever. i taste and smell fine. i think he just doesn't like vaginas. but he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it's just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. no attention down there. i do cum but i have to touch myself because he won't do it. it's just basically like he's having sex with me and i'm masturbating like rubbing my own clit so i can get off too. i don't wanna force him to do anything he doesn't like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? he's 100% straight and he likes boobs and he's attracted to girls and he likes when i wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. he just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. his penis is not beautiful i still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. idk it's weird. 

my friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. my friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they're always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. my friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. my boyfriend doesn't even like to ever look at my butthole. my boyfriend thinks it's disgusting if i get too wet and he said it's like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if i drip onto his sheets and dirty them. he will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that's it. i get jealous sometimes. i wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. it sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. it's like he hates me for having a vagina or something. he's never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted. g",8

"by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but actually close to a year ago. last october to be exact. 

so backstory. i had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. they just didn't want one thing: us having sex before marriage. they had a lot of reasons. and we were actually planning on it. but we both weren't virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. so of course, temptation got the better of us. okay, end of backstory. 

she was a senior in high school and i had just started college about an hour away. we rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. we would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. everytime she would leave i would get sad, but knew i'd see her again. 

one time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. no answer. she said she was gonna text her. made sense to me. once she said we had, we got right to business. she put her phone on the bed, and i didn't even 

things went on for awhile. lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. lots of fun. and by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. followed by some vibrating. it was her phone ringing, but we couldn't find it. then we found it under my ass. we laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. it was her mom. and within seconds, my girlfriend's expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

turns out that she hadn't clicked send on the text she sent out. so her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. and in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone ""daddy"" who was definitely not her dad (the mother's words, not mine).  

she told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
my girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. i attempted to calm her down but she wouldn't. so i drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying ""how could she do this"" and other things along those lines. my girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. her mother absolutely said i was not allowed over. 

so we got back to our hometown, i parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn't get caught. she drove home. i called my mom for a surprise ""i'm home for the weekend"". she came and picked me up, and i bawled in her arms. i told her everything. she comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

we got back to my house, and i laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. i cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. for the longest time, i thought i never would hear from her again. then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. she said she was coming over and we needed to talk. once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. she said her parents were calm now, and then i was gonna be able to come talk. i was nervous, but i loved her so i did it. 

when i got to their house, i walked in and instantly just started apologizing. i went on and on about how ""we won't do it again"" and how ""we're just stupid teenagers"" and most importantly how i was gonna ""rebuild their trust"". eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. we opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

at the end of it all, i learned they just loved their daughter and didn't want her getting hurt. but they trusted me. and we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. and everything is cool. sometimes i worry it's still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. 

tldr: my girlfriend and i took phone sex to a whole other level.

"my (f 25) boyfriend (m 27) got angry when i asked him if i could put a face mask on him.. we were lying in bed and i was putting a face mask on. all i asked was ""can i put some on you?"". i just thought it was fun, i didn't think it was a big deal at all. but, i guess it was emasculating or whatever because he scowled at me and raised his voice saying ""do i look like a bitch to you?"". i said ""no i'm sorry"". i tried to just get him to relax and he did but i could tell he was irritated the rest of the night. he kept glaring at me and his demeanor was colder. it honestly bothered me, i wanted to cry i had to hold in my tears. i hate to be talked to like that by him. why would he snap at me over nothing? i wasn't trying to make him feel like a ""bitch"". i mean jesus christ. i don't know. it hurt my feelings. am i just being sensitive?",8
"i (37m) just inadvertantly stumbled upon some suspicious activity with my wife (36f). so our phone bill came due but it was more than usual so i gave it a once over to see where the extra charges came from. turned out to be new activations, no big deal. although, while on the main page i noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. i expect her to have a lot of texts. i got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when i text her at work cause shes busy.....who could she be texting? i decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

i honestly dont know what to think. my curiosity got to me and i started plowing through old phone bills. this number started showing up on august the 8th. since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. often into the wee hours of the morning. shes never mentioned any new friends... 

so i get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and i start helping her find it. i found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. i hate being that guy but i did it. checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. some dude . she has him programmed first and last name. checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and i also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

i love my wife and i trust her completely, i think. i dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. and actually now that i think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. 😕 i really dont like the direction this is heading. am i reading to much into this? we've been married for 6 years and have 2 kids. we havent had a date in months and havent had sex in even longer than that. not for lack of trying on my part. shes gained a little weight and says she just always feels gross. anyone have any advice?

tl;dr wife texts dude over 16k times since august; shits pointing towards infidelity but i'm trying to rationalize her actions...",8
"i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him - update. hey! a week ago i posted about the fact that i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and i wasn't sure where to go from there. i was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! i think i was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

the following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. on thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. i was so nervous i thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. he said that he's sorry he wasn't around much the days after but i was like no it's fine i haven't been home either, i knew it wasn't on purpose. the vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said 'like maybe you have a good soul if that's a thing' and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. and then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how i felt and he said 'sorry i'm not trying to make this a big thing i just want to make sure you're okay with everything and i want to make sure you feel respected'. i was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. i said that i was fine and that i felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. he said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we're both happy living together whatever happens. i said i agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

it was all really sweet and nice and i think that whatever happens, he's a respectful guy and we'll communicate and we'll be mindful of each other. at one point while we were talking he did say 'sorry we've gotten off track, but i felt it was important we didn't just discuss what happened, i wanted to get to know you a bit. it was a spontaneous thing so i'm glad you agree that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it, and there's no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. we'll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that's all we can do. and maybe we'll have sex again too if you're also up for that.' 

god he's great. anyway, sorry it's nothing too exciting but i had a few pm's asking for an update so i wanted to let you know :) i'm really happy with the outcome and i'm sure we'll be good friends at the very least.",8
"there were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today.. this came up while discussing movies with my sister. i asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. she said something like ""i'm not sure if they got the roles cuz they're good and female or just because of the latter"" and it really opened my eyes. 

the current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like wonder woman being exceptions). i found terminator, power rangers, castle, etc. way cooler when they made them equals with men and not simply trash them. also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? i remember when the chess player judith polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. now, with a separate chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. but i'm digressing.

power rangers vs the new ghostbusters is my point. females were part of the original pr team in almost equal numbers. they usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. that. was. awesome. the new ghostbusters isn't. 

now i'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

edit: to answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, i'm not making this up. women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. although this was challenged by judit and now by hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",6

"my(25m) girlfriend(22f) wants to share our incomes, thing is, i make roughly 7 times as much, advice please. so here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. my girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, i finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company i did my internship at and within a year i got a promotion and a large payraise and i am now making roughly 150k a year, while she makes 20k a year.

now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place i bought so i pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, phone bill, netflix and so forth.

now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently i pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

now she seems to be jealous i got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs i put the majority in my savings account.

in my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

so what do i do, i hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if i am honest i am questioning my relationship as there is no way i am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

edit: so, there are so many comments i am having a hard time keeping up with it. if i don't respond, know that i am trying to at least read your comment. but currently when i read and respond to 1 comment i get 10 more! haha. i just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... even those who yell about mgow or something and those who are if the opinion i need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in! i had not expected my post to blow up like this though hahaha.",8
"my38m wife 24f of 3 years, took my daughter14f to visit her parents in russia. wife doesn't want to come back. like above. sorry for ranting and any grammar errors i've been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. also this is a throwaway so i don't completely dox myself. 

my wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of st. petersburg, russia. 

my wife herself was born there, and came to the us when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (this is not a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). i was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

as she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the us. it just kind of happened that way. (she entered on a f1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we've been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the us with my family and one in russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

until last week she hadn't seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as i have custody. 

as school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it'd be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. she wanted to bring my daughter with her - i initially was opposed to this - but i caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

through her trip she hasn't been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on whatsapp and photos etc. which is understandable - she's on vacation and i don't expect constant alerts, but i would have liked a little more of an update. my daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

yesterday morning i had texted my wife that i'd be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. she read the message but never answered. i told my daughter the same and she never responded. i assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

i had a hellish day at work so i went right to bed so i could be up early to go get them. 
i wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and i look at my phone to message them. i see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn't know how to get home. confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 panicked i reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. she finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn't want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that i took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - i go off on her through text. she tells me off and stops answering me. 

i reach out to her mom through whatsapp (who doesn't speak english at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. her mom said she didn't know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

panicked i go to reach out the us consulate in saint petersburg only to find online it was shut down in march and the nearest is in moscow. i reach out to the moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a huge help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

my wife still hasn't answered me since our blow out. and her mom said she hasn't seen or heard from her since this morning.

what the hell am i supposed to even do with this? the lack of responsibility and carelessness she showed is astronomical to me.",8

"my dog keeps getting attacked by an emotional support dog in our apartment.. \wisconsin\ there is an 8 month old male german shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. i have a six month old australian shepherd. we live on the fifth floor and the gs lives about four doors down. we run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

he has attacked my as in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. he attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the gs was hostile. the worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. when we walked inside the gs was off his lease and immediately started attacking my as. the owner did not immediately intervene. i got down to try to get between the gs and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. after about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the gs off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. i took pictures after the event. i had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my as's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

i first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. they said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. i spoke with the owner of the gs after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their gs just for on the grounds. the attacks have happened so often that i do not think they can easily control their dog. my as is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from gs's if he sees them in public.

after seeing the gs and the owner for about a week after these events, i kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. i spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. she said that the 8 month old gs is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. i suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. she said she is not comfortable with that.

i do not know the logistic of esd's but i do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. what should i do in this situation? i feel that if i go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume esd's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).

&#x200b;

**edit:** this post got a lot of responses and i'm so thankful for it. i read all your comments. unfortunately the post was locked before i even got off work so i didn't get to reply to all.

stemming from the advice i got i contacted the apartment again via email so that i'd have a paper trail, i explained that she said she would not muzzle him due to him ""being a esd"". i also provided links to local government sites stating that esd's are not the same as service dogs, and directly asked that they intervene at this point. i am awaiting their response.

i also called the local department of neighborhood services. i filed my case, she said they will assign someone to it who will contact me and begin the investigation into it.

in lieu of this, i then contacted the pet store where the worst attack occurred. the owner was very supportive on the idea of starting a case against them. she remembered the incident and said that i had made a purchase afterwards, so she looked up my name and found the exact time we were in the store. she said she will trim the cctv footage into a clip and email it to me.

so now i will have footage of the attack in the store, a picture of the resulting marks on my arm as well as my dogs bloody paw, and the email exchange with the apartment. i feel pretty ready to get this started now.

thank you to everyone who came here to help. i really had no idea where to go with this. i'd just like to say that my goal is not to have their dog euthanized. i blame the owners completely for this. i'm sure with the proper training he would not be so uncontrollable. my goal is for the gs to be muzzled while he is in public, and hopefully to be removed and given to responsible owners if possible. thanks for everyone's care and advice!

"i (f25) found out my fiance (m27) is with me for money/family business. to preface. my family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. thus i am a trustfund baby. i try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
i met my fiance mark when i was 20 and working as a waitress.

we began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

now mark is not poor. he is upper middle class. and while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. i thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. what i want to say is that i never had the impression that mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

in the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and i stood up for him and fought with my dad. they came to love and accept him. when mark graduated dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

sunday i was supossed to work in the evening and i was going to stay with my sister. but i got a fever and was basically just non functioning so i stayed home. instead of staying in our bedroom i made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (i didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so i just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

mark came home when i was fast asleep and i was woken up by loud voices in our garden. i pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark was there with a few friends. just as i wanted to say hello i noticed that they were talking about me.

his friend kept laughing and calling mark ""the man!"". then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and i am free"".

at this moment i felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. i kept hearing them calling me trust fund barbie and stupid and so on. i didn't know what to do so i just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. i texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

i haven't returned home and just told mark that i was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
my sister has been really worried but i just feel so ashamed about everything. my family was right mark is a gold digger and i fell for it. even if i tell my family what happened i have no proof. my father can't fire him just because he is a dick. as far as i know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him i think. i just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

edit : we are non us. mark wasnt talking about anything else. he has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it i helped pay it off. there is no way he wasn't talking about me

edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. i opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. we have called up dad and i will talk to him tommorow. i will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

edit3: some questions have come up.

i don't drive that's why my fiance didn't see my car. i mostly uber arround

i worked as a waitress for the experience not for the money and i don't anylonger

i don't work for my father i am a company shareholder and i have to go to the general quartal meetings but i don't work for him.

last edit : i am really tired that you guys are defending him saying that it could have been a joke. guess what. it's not fucking funny. you don't degrade and disrespect your partner for laughs. you don't go along calling them stupid, trustfund barbie, stupid bitch and you definitely don't make remarks yourself. i don't understand that macho bravado as many of you have called it, but i don't think that's okay so stop with those comments. it was deeply hurt full.",8

"for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face. my newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. it requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

enter lady with four kids: a newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). she really really should have brought an ipad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. the mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. she was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. ffs at one point when i wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. my newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and i did not feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

i tried being polite about it ""sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""ma'am!"" -points to kid- the lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. rinse and repeat. i told her she needed to stay with her mom. little punk deadass says ""i don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


finally, i'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? why is your baby crying! make him stop! i don't like that"" and her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. so now i'm out formula, kid still screaming, and i have a huge mess that i don't have a great way to clean up. 

i'm at my wits end. i raise my voice at this kid. ""look what you did. i am not your mom, i am not your babysitter. you are bothering me. get out of my face!!"" 

people looked at me like i was the biggest bitch on earth. a lady speaking spanish actually did call me a bitch. the little girl starts crying. i'm not apologizing. the mom confronts me, i tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill i'm prepared to die on.

"update ga just moved into a condo, neighbor is raising hell over my nonexistent pet bird.  original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8chp37/ga_just_moved_into_a_condo_neighbor_is_tasing/)

tl;dr of previous post\- my next door neighbor is absolutely convinced i have a pet bird and has made complaints to the hoa, animal control, and the police because my supposed pet bird is so loud it is causing emotional distress.

i got another complaint from the head guy running the hoa that my \(now multiple\) birds are causing severe emotional distress to my neighbors and their children, who can't sleep at night because of my ""flock"" of birds. the wife sent a recording to him as proof of my bird\(s\), and to tell him to tell me my smoke alarm is also beeping and needs the batteries replaced because they can hear it from their unit as well. 

now, you can clearly hear a smoke alarm beeping, as well as birds chirping on the recording. however, the beeping is coming from their unit, as i can faintly hear it if i press my ear to the shared wall. and the birds that are supposedly my pets? the ones that are so loud that their whole household can't sleep and it's causing severe emotional distress? those are the birds outside. it's literally the chirping of the birds outside they're hearing. now, i'm no disney princess, so i have no effect on wild birds\- or imaginary pet birds\- for that matter. i mean, my singing is so terrible it actually scares them away.  and i'm not sure how any person that is not a complete moron would mistake ordinary bird chirping for ""a flock of loud, abused rain forest birds"".

i've sent a letter to the hoa telling them to kindly pound sand and stop harassing me over the wild birds that i have no control over. i'm also going to record the birds from my porch and from inside the condo so if they say i have birds again i can prove that it's just ordinary outside birds making reasonable outside bird noises.  i'm looking into get a bird feeder as well, because it's allowed by the hoa covenants and fuck these people for being utter imbeciles and blaming me for the natural behaviour of wild animals. 

now i'm just going to sit and wait for the next problem they have with me,  because i don't think these nitwits will take kindly to being proven wrong over something so stupid.",2

"my ex proposed. i said no. he is now talking about suing me. advice?. just want to say this is going to sound insane but i am not trolling/making it up.

me and this guy were together for 3 years. we're 19 now. we never talked about the future until a year in. before then i'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

in short, i wanted kids, he didn't. i wanted to stay in ireland, he didn't. i wanted to get married, he didn't. when i realised it was a bad match i broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. this happened a few times over the next 18 months in this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

we knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something i would want further down the line, i wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. if i were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then i might have an issue, but when i'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

when i went to see him this time i was again, considering breaking up with him. aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that i really don't like. so when i arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, i assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so i wouldn't cause a scene. i don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

in the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. first he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff i liked and what my taste was. i assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so i told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. i also said ""go cheap"".

the other thing he asked me was how i felt about public proposals. i told him immediately that i, personally, disliked them as i felt i wouldn't be able to say no, even if i wanted to. i feel like public proposals are ok when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not ok at all. i assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

i never thought in a million years that he would propose.

so you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

the ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. he got on one knee, and held it out to me. we were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

i said no.

well, i didn't so much say ""no"". i ran out of the restaurant.

he drove me there, so i got a cab back, and drove home that night.

i realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but i didn't know what else to do. i could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all i knew was that i didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. i felt like i couldn't even speak, i was so upset about the whole thing. so i just got up and ran.

i just want to take the opportunity to say here that i really really don't care about the rings. honestly, when i want to get married (which is absolutely not when i'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and i'd say yes. i wouldn't even need a ring. i know i'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what i'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

i didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. he said that he thought a proposal was something i'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. he said that he was out of pocket for the rings. he'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. he linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). when i asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped i would cover the cost of mine. he said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. he'd hoped that i would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but i said no. he also said i'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if i was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

we both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on sunday.

he has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that i have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which i had no part in spreading. he says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. so €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

i think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but i am not a law student or a lawyer. he is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

what do i do about all of this? do i need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

thanks in advance :)

&#x200b;

edit:  he knew i wanted to get married but not to him. he not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. he openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and i told him that this was why i was breaking up with him the times before this that i have ended the relationship. during the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like i'm gonna propose"" (that one was last april)

"update i 25m got ghosted by my girlfriend 23f of 2 years.. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvawkw/i_25m_got_ghosted_by_my_girlfriend_23f_of_2_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

thanks everyone for your support. i actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. i didn't know she'd be there. she said hi to me like nothing was the matter. like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. she looked great and i wish i hadn't gone to the party. i was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. but seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

after the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. she said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when i was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. just like that. she said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). she said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

i said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. she apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. she said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

i just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. so she just decided pretending i didn't exist was the best way to do it. 

i can't say hearing all this helps. i don't really even have much closure. but people wanted me to update and so i did.

thanks for all your help guys. wish it was more interesting than it really was.",8

"by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today.... when i was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. so spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and i thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  i had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
the googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until i had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out i pushed it even further in. i was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. i could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, i stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. after a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

skip forward to this tuesday;
i do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and i was submerged under water, after i emerged and pulled my boat out i could hear a slight rattle in my ear and i knew instantly what it was.
it's now friday and the rattling happens every time i turn my head and i still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

tldr: put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... it didn't

so this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don't believe it, which is fair enough cause i think it's abit mental aswell.

however i'll get a doctor's visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and i'll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.

alot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and i can honestly say i don't have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think they're as big of thing in the uk.

"i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately.. i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

this is a throwaway account, due to certain circumstances i worry for my safety of myself, family, & friends so thus the throwaway. 

i am currently residing in wisconsin.

i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

**information:**
my very first inkling something was up, is the day i believe this happened he came running crying into my arms when i picked him up, previously he was excited to be dropped off and picked up because he loved being there. and they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

after this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

that night i had picked him up, i changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. this is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or ""washes his hands"" with the baby wipes. this time he was not himself. he was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. as i took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, ""no! no no friends boyfriends name!"" and began crying hysterically. 

my heart sank. as a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. i know something was done to my baby. 

i looked my friends boyfriend's criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. this man is dangerous, and i didn't even know this.

**my concerns and what can i do?:**

notably in wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does cps investigate the person reporting? both myself and the party involve?

will the investigators / cps take this matter seriously when regarding my child's age?

how do i go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

what kind of things will they (either cps or law enforcement etc) look into?

if reported, and nothing happens, what things can i do to protect my child(ren) and my family? 

for a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs i can keep my eyes open for?

any advice, any help at all will greatly help. i'm absolutely devastated and need help as i'm at a loss.

**edit:** i need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why i'm scared for myself and my family.

**edit 2**: i am currently on my way to my appointment with cps and law enforcement that specializes in sexual abuse cases i will update later, thank you all so much for your kind words of support and advice, i honestly appreciate it and will update on the outcome.",2
"for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?. context: so a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called ""jan"". i am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. i'm a tall and lanky male at 6'1 and 155lbs. jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


recently, we had a watch party at jan's apartment for the michigan football bowl game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. my buddy and i were talking about whether our qb should declare for the draft or return. i said ""i sure hope he comes back, dylan (our backup qb) is still young and is still pretty scrawny."" 

jan has a huge crush on dylan and didn't appreciate that i called him skinny. 

this caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying ""what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you're literally built of twigs?"" ""you would die playing football. tbh i don't think you could even lift a helmet!"" 

at first, i took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. i usually got my leg pulled about my physique but i never took it personally. until she started making it personal.

""look at you, you're like one of those starving african kids on those tv commercials""  (i'm brown but not african)
""that's why dylan is a chick-magnet and my ex dumped you. you look malnourished""

she kept going and now i was beginning to boil. i wasn't even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. but then i snapped.

her: ""go lift some weights. it's okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.""

me: ""if you could tell me what your current diet is, i'm sure i'll put on weight in no time.""

*silence*

her: ""what are you trying to say?""

me: ""i'm saying that if i'm a malnourished african then you could be on the biggest loser. and i'm pretty certain you wouldn't win.""

her: ""no wonder ex didn't want you. go fuck yourself.""

me: ""and no guy wants you. the last dick you got was moby dick. fucking whale.""

at this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

since this was at jan's place, i figured i should leave (michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). i finished my beer and left. i got a facetime from one of my friends who is jan's roommate. she urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and i went too far. i didn't feel that way and i don't want to apologize.

am i the asshole?

edit: grammar

info: we were both drunk but i'm pretty certain she had drank more than me

"for asking my wife to have an abortion. my wife and i (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. we don't have any kids and don't want kids. we had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. she's on the pill, but accidents happen. she said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. naturally, i was surprised by the news and her change of mind. i asked her if she considered getting an abortion. she said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. she told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. i told her i wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. she started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. she wont answer my phone calls.

i'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. i was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. i know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but i can't help but have a negative view about it. a few years ago i tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but i couldn't. i was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. my wife is aware of these points.

i just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. i also don't like kids. my wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows i wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. i understand why she thinks that, but i still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little i would be involved in raising him or her.

for asking my wife to have an abortion?

edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. if she ever wanted to stop taking it, i would support her 100%. i realize that i'm an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. it honestly never occurred to me until now (i think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). i see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. i'm going to get snipped asap.

edit #2: she and i talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. here are the main takeaways:

* i apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. i also apologized if she felt like i was pressuring her when i asked her to have an abortion. i didn't mean to pressure her, but i know words aren't always received as we intended. she said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows i was totally caught off guard.
* she apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. she said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes i don't feel like she tricked me (i don't).
* we mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. we've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",3
"my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile. hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

i don't really know how to begin so i'm just gonna dive right in. we've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and i have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. this took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. his parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. to the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

the problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. he has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. he talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. cool, i thought. that all sounds beautiful. 

we didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. it was on a day i was working so i couldn't go with him and when i asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. i was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

i did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

it was definitely a shock but i reacted positively and told him it looked really good. it was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

it's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. i can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. bf is super proud of it and i honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

my only issue with it is during sex. 

it takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. it doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo really stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

not to mention this thing is like the mona fu*cken lisa. 

any position that we're facing each other in, i always end up making eye contact with it. and every time i do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. every time. ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, i doubt i would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of any six year old. 

it's honestly ruining our sex life. 

i haven't told my bf any of this because i feel like i can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (i know lasers exist but i doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where i'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried i'm not attracted to him anymore.

i am attracted to him. i'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

what can i do in this situation? the thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. but looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

should i talk to him? am i overreacting? is our sex life officially dead? 

thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- my boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and i can't stop making eye contact with it during sex.

update: this has gotten a lot more attention than i anticipated. some people are saying it's reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. i'm not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. currently debating whether i should just let fate take the wheel on this one. 

otherwise i've received some really phenomenal advice on how i should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward. i was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship-ending issue before i made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through. so thank you so much. 

i'll make a new post to update how things go once i've talked to my bf about all this. if he doesn't see this post first i think i'll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

"il neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). landlord hasn't done anything. i rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex's parking lot is included in my rent. i have a parking pass that i display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

i have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. i have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. i have also kept a log of every time i notice this neighbor in my spot & when i've contacted my landlord. (for what it's worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he's gone to reserve it, so i don't think this is just confusion - i don't think he owns a spot at all).

this past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. i confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. i once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, i shouldn't have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

well, apparently neighbor didn't listen, because last night he was in my spot again. i called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn't come or were talked out of it by him, because when i woke up this morning, his car was still there.

additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an hoa, & my landlord always claims he'll ""notify them"" when i make a complaint about my neighbor. 

i'm growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as i pay for this spot. with that being said, i'd appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. what can i do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. what actions can i take to ensure my neighbor doesn't get me towed from a spot that i am authorized to use?

update edit: i just spoke with the hoa. they confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn't even have a parking spot at all. hoa also said he should've never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won't happen again. finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that i can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot.

"for ruining jeans for women?. i work at an office where i'm allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the ""no jeans policy."" she frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

problem is, for the past few months that i've been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. that is, until a few days ago. 

i love wearing jeans, and have always felt i could make them professional too. i was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. she said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

i said ""well, the girls get to wear jeans.""

""no they don't.""

then, my coworker, amanda walked in wearing jeans. i pointed that out. my manager confronted amanda, telling her that she wasn't allowed to wear jeans. 

in the moment, amanda appeared playfully mad at me. but i went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but i think she may actually be mad. i apologized, saying i didn't want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

aita?

edit/ update: wow, did not expect all of the responses, though i can't say i'm surprised about the polarization. at work today, it wasn't bad. only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. i do feel bad that i ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day i will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",3

"my family is abusive and i want to emancipate myself. i'm a 16 year old girl. i live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. my maternal grandfather also stays with us. my parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - i was in the car but i survived - and i was taken in by my maternal aunt. my dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

the last two years have been hell for me. not only because i still can't get over losing my parents (i cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. my mom was actually estranged from her family. she was white, and my dad was black. her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. they have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and i guess i'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

they have told me just that on several occasions. that my existence is a mistake. i get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. and i'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. sometimes it gets physical. sometimes it feels like i'm trapped in a minefield. i have to be so careful about where i step cause the repercussions may be explosive. my ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. he has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

i can't live like this anymore. i'm an absolute emotional mess. i wanna emancipate myself but i don't know how to go about it. i know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 i'm close with a set of twins at school - i'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. their parents own a farm and i work regularly with the family. i'm also into photography and i've been doing real good with shooting weddings. they are very lucrative and i've saved up a substantial amount. with summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but i also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

the parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. i've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. i don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

i would really appreciate advice.

thank you

"if your dog has cancer and you opt for chemo, you're a bad person.. an old dog lives to be 15. they are also the most loyal and perfect friend could ever possibly hope for. we truly are not good enough for dogs. on the grand scale of intelligence in this world, they are also complete and total idiots. they don't understand medicine. they don't understand that you are trying to extend their life. 

all they know is that on a regular basis the most important person in their life, their owner, is taking them to a strange, smelly, terrifying torture arena. they are stabbed, poked, prodded and their veins are filled with poison. the next thing they know they have gone from terrified to nauseated, fatigued and just feeling like absolute shit. and you, their human, are doing it for what? to squeeze out a tortured 1 - 5 more years?

they don't understand and they can't consent. let your beautiful friend enjoy the last few months in peace and then send them off surrounded by their family. you're not trying to save your dog, you're being cruel because you don't want to let go.

edit time!! everything above this is the same as when i originally posted it. below is my addendum. 

so, it has come to my attention that i was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. for more information on pets and chemo i went to this site, seems reliable(https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

in keeping with the spirit of this sub i'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, ""if your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person.""

i know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. the reason i think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, especially in instances when the animal is suffering.

in closing, i get it. putting your pet down is a very personal decision, but i still get to think you're a bad person if i think your reasons are shitty.",6

"instagram is ruining everything (a rant). i think that instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. let me explain:

1. **ig is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. while social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. no political or important dialogue is happening. i would argue that even pinterest is more worthwile since at least diys teach you something.
2. **ig is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** why we are all pretty much aware from our own instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **ig is bad for your mental health.** because unrealistic standards are set on instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in ig. this also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (see also this article: http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/(http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). i also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **ig makes people vain.** taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. it's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. this makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **ig gives the worst incentives to people.** the reason i am ranting right now is that i saw a vice video about a poppy field in california that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for instagram (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka)). they then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". so these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. this shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. now i don't think that they are inherently bad people but i think that instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

i would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. so just to clarify, i do think that one can use instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. what i wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. and while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives i feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. i do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. however, i feel that while some good instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",6

"american colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.. according to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. in america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


in those 8 years of school, i must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. there are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and i hate using this term) a sheep. to my understanding, american colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (not 100% sure on that) so, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of stem field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


edit: ok, i understand and agree that philosophy is important. however, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. i just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. hell, my school has bio ethics, i haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

it honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",6

"for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?. first up please know i am trying my best to be kind in my wording. i run a small operation where i guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. i have served all kinds of clients.

i got an inquiry for a group called ""womens+ adventures"" and because it was during pride month, i thought maybe it was an lgbtq+ group. i chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and i started the training plan.

the group wanted to work up to ""a 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. going off what everyone reported, i decided gray's peak. one of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

when i arrived for our first group hike, i learned ""womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than lgbtq+. no issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

the first hike was... awful. it was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. when we got started hiking, it was very slow. one woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. one ate all of her snacks after the first break. lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

after we got back (6 hours later) i pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. she insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that i didn't believe them. when i suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. i gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd hike went even worse. i had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. so i called the head and told her that i thought it was best if i refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that i am fatphobic, i'm mocking them, etc.

please, please keep in mind that i have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. i consider myself to be very patient. one of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

i refunded the money and ended contact only to find my social media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. you can guess what i was called. i felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me i was an asshole for not powering through, that i should have given them three chances, that i should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

"bank gave away my entire banking account. so last week, a check i wrote bounced from an account i have that i rarely use. it's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. i called the bank where i was informed that i closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". i told them i sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. after them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. i finally got them to open a fraud case. 

here's the crazy part. i call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. i finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. this woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. she lives in florida and i live in colorado. we do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. so she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. i figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. open and shut case.

so now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. they asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but i have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. the icing on the cake was i got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

do i have any legal recourse? do i just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? what advice do you have?",2

the funeral was held in korea last week, i went with the kids. her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. they also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

however this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. even then there is a big language barrier between us. my ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them.

"a good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. now his adult son is suing me (virginia).. so basically, i lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. he was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. we watched football together, drank together, and all that. i even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. the point, i guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. i think this point is important.




he recently passed, which sucks. then i learned he left me a little something. that little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since i had no idea he had that kind of money. that 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. so it's not like i'm getting the majority of his estate. but then his son, who i'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  i ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




i have three things going for me:




1. my friend was mentally acute. he had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. our town's not big, and i know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. hell, i even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. these people can be witnesses i think, though i don't know how civil suits work.


3. his adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. she came around from time to time, and knew her dad and i hung out and stuff. the first time i met her, her dad and i were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the south so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





basically, my point is he and i were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? also, what kind of lawyer should i hire? the lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but i don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.

***i have to say when ""titty boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox i got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***

tl;dr: somewhere along the line while i was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to titty boobowitz in gmail and i never noticed. then i attempted job hunting. no wonder i got no responses.

edit: just because i didn't make it clear - i emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and i appreciated the heads up. we had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. i'm relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to tons of idiots like me. at least i didn't put ""attention to detail"" anywhere in my resume.

"by joking about ancestrydna and 23andme.. this actually happened over christmas last year.

my family, including (paternal) my grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having christmas dinner. 

my grandfather brought up that he did ancestrydna (or was it 23and me?). i don't remember the exact one, because i can barely think about it. it's hard just writing this up.

it was really cool to hear what he found. he found mostly scandinavian spread out over the british isles, particularly wales. we knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% persian! very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. he's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. 

the only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of king george iii. the reason why i question this is king george iii is recorded as one of the few kings who never had a mistress. 

however, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of king george iii (we are descended from the woman). he mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

anyway, off topic. i thought it was fascinating, and i love hearing what he's found. i brought up possibly using my christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. i don't think i was really going to do it, i usually use the money to pay bills.

silence. and it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

my sister and i look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. my parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. we look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. i have weird hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. my sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

i always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. i never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair i have such cool pretty eyes. 

well, okay.

dad starts first. dad (d), mom (m), sister (s), and me.

d: there's a chance 3ar3ara_g0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

d: your grandparents know.

s: okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

m: no, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

me: he's still out there?

s: but obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

my dad and mom look at each other. 

m: it was my brother.

i felt so sick. i felt... dirty. i had to run to the bathroom to throw up. i couldn't stop shaking. my sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. we probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

the rest of the vacation was just weird. if it weren't for my nephews, i'm pretty sure i would have just gone home.

oh my nephews are wonderful.

well, we came home, and i had to battle with the ""do i want to know?"" thoughts. i could get a dna test. but i couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. but it weighed on me too much. i had to know in order to move forward. so i asked my dad if he would submit his dna with mine. we weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. it was hard asking him to not say anything to her. he should be able to talk to his wife.

so we submitted the test. 

i am my father's daughter. i cried when i got the results. it was a huge weight off my shoulders.

i made a decision not to tell my dad - i wanted to surprise them. i kept saying i hadn't gotten the results back. i did tell my sister though.

i gave them the piece of paper on mother's day. i was going to wait until father's day, but i couldn't. so i got a blank card. 

inside i wrote: ""mom, open the paper."" she opened it and i had written happy mother's day, and happy early father's day. 

lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

thank god.

edit: left out half a sentence, oops. 

it was my uncle on my mother's side. i have met him. my sister and i were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

my parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there i guess was his reason. plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

my mom didn't go no contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. why that long, i have no idea. those are her reasons. 

she did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. i guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

grandmother is dead now.

this happened in louisiana.

"for being cold to my ex-fiance and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?. so, right now i'm in kinda a shitty situation. i've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. all of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but i don't feel that way, heres the story.

i knew my ex for almost 10 years. we go back all the way to high school and have been friends. after we graduated i said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. we dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. i won't lie, i loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. she, however, seemed super worried. i sat down and talked with her about it. i told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

these past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.

suffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not said a single word to her. i have pretty much told her that i want her out of my life. i also demanded a dna test the minute the child is born. if it is mine, i'll help her support it. if not, then i am never seeing her again.

i've been cold to her. her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but i've refused any contact with them. at one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and i kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. any time she's tried to ""reconcile"" i've shut it down,

my friends are saying i'm in wrong here. according to them she's pregnant and because of that i should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. i disagree fully. but i could be wrong. am i letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",3

"unnecessary/random sex scenes in movies or shows are annoying.. i hate whenever i am watching a show or movie and an unnecessary sex scene comes on. especially if there are multiple sex scenes that aren't needed. sometimes i'm watching something with a family member and a scene like that comes on and it makes everything so awkward and some of those scenes are so long and dragged out. i just feel like those scenes are being added into shows more often because they think it'll get more viewers (kind of like horror movies who use too many jump scares to try to make things more creepy, but it just becomes annoying)",6

"update coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex's dog euthanized. can i help prevent this?. link to first post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

glad to say i've got a happy update!

the coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). i wasn't working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

the ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. he's also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. the dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn't shown any human or dog aggression. 

police and animal control are very good around here. they assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they'd require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can't be ""bitten"" by the dog without violating it. and the department says they don't allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog's owner but not the police/animal control. 

so the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. i'd call it a win!

thank you all for your advice and support!",2
"it's fine to not like kids, but constantly talking about how much you hate them is just you being an asshole.. seriously. like i get it, kids can be gross and annoying and stressful. it's fine to not like them, it's fine to not want to be around them, and it's certainly fine to not want to have them.

what some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. even if you're not saying it to their face, even if they're too young to even understand you — you're just an asshole. 

also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. they have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. they are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. and just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

i'm just honestly sick of people treating little kids like they aren't people yet, like they're less deserving of the same respect you would give to an adult. it's so douchey and automatically makes me want to stay 3000 miles away from you.


edit: okay i need to clarify some stuff. i'm usually just a lurker on reddit, i'm not used to all this attention and i'm not completely sure how to deal with it.

i think people who shove their pro kid opinions down people's throat are down right awful. people have every right in the world to not want kids and as i've mentioned in the comments, i totally get why so many people hate kids. you're allowed to hate them! they can be nasty, annoying, mean, etc. in this post i was trying to express how people who treat children like they are subhuman are assholes. i'm not trying to insult anyone's lifestyle.

also, i deleted all the edits thanking the people who gave me awards because someone commented that it was annoying and i realized i wholeheartedly agree haha. sorry about that! like i said, i'm not used to my posts getting attention.

"for telling my new neighbours that i've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends?. i've been away since thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently sunday afternoon where i live.  here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that monday to friday, which means i had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. 

my 30 something year old neighbours moved in on friday when i wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when i was collecting my mail. she goes ""don't check your mailbox on weekends. they don't deliver on weekends. so don't check it."" (in a rude karen voice, if you know then you know.) already, i know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and i'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so i said ""i know, it's just i've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so i had to check the mailbox."" i don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

she seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. then we both went inside and that was that. about 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking i was held captive in my basement which i don't have, so i explained to them what i had said and they just laughed and left.

just before, i was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think i was kidnapped

"my 33 m wife 32 f hit me at a family bbq. everybody laughed.. i don't think i'd ever felt more pathetic than i did at that moment. we'd gotten into an argument. she wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). i'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. i didn't think i should drive. my sister was also urging me to go. she was standing right there when my wife hit me. it was square across the face. i'd just told her there was no way i was driving since i'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. my wife called me an asshole... then wham...

my sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. everyone around us laughed. maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but i can't say for certain. nevertheless i felt humiliated.

the thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. it started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). it was infrequent at first. she was always super apologetic. over time it escalated. she started throwing and smashing things. screaming. berating me. hitting, kicking, and punching me. i don't even know how it got so bad. it just is and i feel trapped. who in their right minds would believe me? who would ever think she was capable of this? sometimes i feel like i'm hallucinating it all and i'm just losing my mind. she was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? i don't even know.

now people do know and it doesn't even matter. it's funny. i'm funny. it's so fucking funny. look at him getting hit by his wife. so damn funny.

i want to disappear. i would if it weren't for my kids.

"aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why i have missing fingers?. i have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. it's fine. i can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days i can't, that's the dyspraxia). however, i won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. i only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

i'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but i still find it annoying. i really don't get why you'd think it would be an ok thing to ask someone about, but hey. i wasn't raised in a barn. usually i nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

anyway, i started a new job about a month ago, and i honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. i felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and i decided to make myself laugh. when the first new coworker asked about it, i completely lied and told her that i chewed them off as a baby. i then decided to tell the next person who asked that i cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that i was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. all genuinely ridiculous reasons but i'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. i didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. maybe they just thought there's no way i'd lie about how i lost my fingers.

within about 3 days, i learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. i'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3d printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

anyway, i told this story to my brother today and he told me that i was an asshole because i caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. my argument is that i'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because i didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, i was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think i actually severed three fingers with dental floss when i was 3. i'll accept my judgement, though.

"- i missed my daughter's award ceremony because of my son, she's still not speaking to me. this might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

i've been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. he's not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. he's been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it's helped somewhat.

their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son's main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

my daughter was graduating from college last year. a week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. i was obviously incredibly proud of her. she asked me to come to it and i said i would. 

her college is two hours from here. i hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. right as i was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. i couldn't leave, and he wasn't calm for hours. i'd left my daughter a voicemail saying i wasn't going to be able to make it. 

she called back that night absolutely livid. she called me a shitty mother, said i had two kids but only cared about one, that i'd missed every game and performance she'd had as a child and it clearly wasn't going to change as adults and that she was just done. she said she knows he can't help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. she hung up and that was it. i've barely spoken with her since. she didn't send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. she hasn't shown up for holidays and i've heard she's engaged but didn't call to tell me. she's cut us out, and in the one of three times we've spoken since she said it's easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn't have to bother getting her hopes up i might come now. 

- i've offered family counselling and all other manner of things. i know i wasn't a perfect mom growing up - i didn't make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. i'm heartbroken but i don't think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",3
"my wife (25f) let her idiot friend (28f) negligently discharge one of my (30m)rifles. i'm angry with both of them and my wife is acting like i'm being unreasonable. advice?. obviously, i keep some guns. just for hunting and sport shooting.

i've got four rifles right now and i keep them locked in a safe in my barn.

before we got together two years ago, my wife had never really been around guns and at first wasn't too interested. after some time (and me explaining my philosophy on why i like to hunt), she has started to express an interest in learning to hunt for herself.

so over the last couple months i have been showing her how to handle and shoot a hunting rifle. taking her to the range, doing some dry practice at home, etc. she's been learning a lot and doing a great job. and she has been very careful to follow proper safety on her firearms which makes me a little madder about the situation this morning.

she had a friend come over this morning. i already don't have a high opinion of this friend. i think she is kind of an idiot, but she's also got that unfortunate personality trait where she tends to be way overconfident and think she knows everything about any given subject. i've gotten into a few mild arguments with her over it. but she's at least harmless so i never worried about her too much.

so this friend came over today. i figured the ladies would just chill out or something and i kinda found my way outside to work on my car, mostly so i didn't get sucked into a conversation with the friend.

at some point i saw them leave the house and head to the barn, but i didn't think much of it. half an hour later i heard a gunshot from inside the barn.

i freaked a little and ran into the barn. i found my wife and her friend, her friend holding one of my rifles, and they were both looking at me like they realized they really messed up.

in the immediate moment, after i saw the ladies were okay, i took my rifle out of friends hands and was mostly concerned with where the round had gone, luckily it just landed in the dirt a few yards away.

so with all that sorted, i wound up heading back inside and took my rifle back inside and got it put back away, and then with the immediate concern gone, i started to get mad.

i'm not necessarily proud of the language i used, but i'll try and portray it accurately since i am asking you alls opinions.

i asked the girls ""why. the. *fuck*. was one of my guns pulled out?""

friend didn't say anything at all, but my wife started explaining that friends husband wants to take her hunting sometime, so she was showing her a little bit about how to use a rifle.

so then i asked why it was loaded. i *know* i clear my guns before they go back in the safe, so i know there wasn't a round in there. and i keep my ammo in a whole different safe then the guns, which incidentally, was opened.

wife explained again she was showing friend how to load it. friend loaded it successfully, obviously, looked down the barrel, and ""accidentally"" pulled the trigger, according to my wife.

they were making a ""woops!"" face that kind ignorant upset me more. and it didn't help matters when my wife's friend started telling me that ""every rifle she is used to"" has a different kind of safety mechanism and-i don't know, i stopped listening to her there and told her it was probably best that she leave.

i locked up my guns and ammo, collected the keys from my wife and went back outside for a smoke. friend takes off shortly after that and my wife approaches me.

she approached me and just said ""sorry"". i was still mad so i told her something like ""yeah...'sorry' isn't quite going to cut it here.""

and then i asked her what she was thinking, because she *knows* better than this. i know she knows better because i taught her!

i told her she made a string of very bad decisions that started with opening the gun safe, handing one of my rifles to someone who very obviously doesn't know how to handle it, then opening the ammo safe, *letting her load a fucking round* and then letting her swing it around!""

my wife started getting defensive. she told me i've taken her shooting on our property before. the effect was the same here, right.

i told her, yeah, we've gone and shot empty bottles and stuff, but we got out into the woods and do it in front of a hill that we know works as a backstop. we *dont* just load a gun and fire wherever!""

wife told me that she *did* make sure her friend pointed in a safe direction at least, meaning out the door towards the ground. and i got a little mad again and said something along the lines of ""yeah, and it's a good fucking thing you did or else one of us would probably be in a police car by now!""

my wife finally said it was just an accident and i didn't have to make such a deal over it, i told her that this was an accident that *would* have killed someone if her luck had been slightly less.

she walked away and as she did i said something to her like ""do not go in the gun safe again without asking me."" she got re-pissed at that and asked why i'm treating her like i'm her ""dad"". i told her that those guns are registered to me and i don't want to go to jail if she hands it to someone who doesn't need to have it.

and thats where we've been all day. we're kind of just avoiding each other. that sort of argument is very uncharacteristic of my wife. she is generally a very responsible and level-headed woman and she is also pretty good about taking responsibility when she makes a mistake. this is the only real shouting-argument we've had and it really bothers me that she's throwing blame on me instead of recognizing how serious this mistake was.

like if she had at least admitted that she made a serious mistake i probably would not have added that bit about staying out of my gun safe.

i *do* for myself feel bad for cussing at her, because i never do that. and what she said about me acting like her dad hit a nerve to. so i'll probably apologize for the cussing here once i'm a little less angry.

so what should i do to handle this now? first big argument, and my wife seems to want to downplay how big of a deal this is. i don't want to talk down to her, but i do, really want her to acknowledge what a bad decision(s) she made or i'm not sure i'll be able to trust her handling one of my guns again. there is also the matter of her friend. like i said, my wife is normally a very responsible and mature woman, but when she gets around her friend it's like she gets......stupider, for lack of a better term. that is something that has bothered me about her friend before, but i've never said anything because it wasn't that big of a deal before.

how should i approach this? how do i get my wife to stop avoiding me right now for one, and how can i get her to recognize the seriousness here without her feeling like i'm trying to be her dad?

i moved away from home to be with him and i don't know anyone here. all of my outings have been with my husband. this weekend, a friend of mine is visiting and i told my husband i would love to have some time off so that i can meet up with her. he flat out said no and that he refuses to use his weekend to take care of the kids and the house. his reasoning is that he works hard all week and expects me to stay home or take the kids with me. am i wrong to be upset over his reaction?

"posting an update to my story using the throwaway format about my sil(14f) accusing me(26m) of impregnating her.. since this is basically over now i'm posting an update on what all happened. the old post was deleted for not using the throw away format so a quick summary. leaving out a lot due to this being mobile and way to much shit went on to cover here.

my sil who is 14 got pregnant and when her parents found out she lied and told them that i was the father.  my wife left to be with her family when this broke and her father was in a rage.  i got a lawyer.

the lawyer i got told me i needed to pack up take of work and stay somewhere we're my wife and her family wouldn't know where to find me.  boy was he right.  the next day our apartment was broken into by my fil and completely trashed with a baseball bat.  my neighbors called the police obviously and he ended up getting arrested but bailed out by my mil the next day.

my wife's entire family constantly texting and calling to say how horrible of a person i was.  my lawyer met with the family and their lawyer to tell them i denied all the accusations and that i wanted a dna test done.  after the meeting the texts and calls switched to calling me a coward for accusing my sil of lying.

this went on for a few more days before the mounting pressure finally broke my sil's resolve.  she came clean  and told everyone who the real father was, being a 15 year old at her school that told her to make something up.

when this news came out i still had to go through some whole bs investigation to show that i wasn't actually a secret child predator.  

i'm self employed so we will see how bad this whole episode is going to screw up my life and i'm definitely pressing charges against my fil for the damage he did to my apartment and threat to my life he posed.  

contrary to what most people on here suggested i do i am not going to immediately divorce my wife.  our marriage was amazing before this happened and i don't want to throw that away over a stupid 14 year old and her boyfriend.  i've seen my wife a few times and told her i understand why she did what she did and that i still want to be with her given that i will not want to be around specifically her father or her sister for a long time and that before we move in together again we get marriage counseling.  she agreed to those terms and we have been to a few sessions separately and together now.  

thanks for the input i got on the old post.

edit:  lot of people are acting like this whole situation continued even with dna evidence proving i was innocent, that's not the case.  there never was a dna test and likely won't be now that sil admitted and the actual father confirmed it.  the threat alone of a dna test is what made her tell the truth.

i also said i'm not immediately divorcing my wife, it may come to it after we have tried counseling but i don't know at this time.  yes i'm hurt by my wife not believing me but at the same time we've only been married for a year and a half and she basically raised her sister while her parents worked and has always been very close to her.  

my wife didn't cut contact with me through this i did at the direction of my lawyer.  i left my phone with him and looking back through it now she never accused me of anything was just asking questions trying to figure out what was going on.  

my fil acted out on his own by breaking in no one knew what he was doing and i don't have any sympathy for his actions and am pressing charges for everything he did.  he broke in not used my wife's keys to get in.  the door frame  was completely destroyed.",8

"by buying my mom an amazon device.. i want to start by giving some background here. i basically live, eat, sleep and breath amazon. i need something, straight to amazon. i use kindle and audible daily. want to stream music, amazon music. want a new movie, prime video. run out of something randomly, ""hey alexa......."" laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. so when looking for a place to store photos, i see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with amazon photos"". naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. automatically upload photos from my phone? even better. 

rewind to september 25th, my mom's birthday. i thought about her gift for a while, but when i remembered she didn't have a smart tv, the answer was easy. i hop on amazon shopping and use my amazon credit card to purchase one firetv stick. she was so happy she could watch netflix on her tv now. yay, success! or so i thought. 

yesterday i get an email from amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the fire tv family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did i imagine that it would sign in to my amazon account without even asking for a password. surely she'd have to use her own account. 

fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. sitting in my mother's kitchen, i glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

i spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. i happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. i'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. i took probably 40 pictures that night for my so to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my entire family to view. i have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

nobody helped me. the remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where i'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. i didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, i just ran away. 

the worst part, i asked alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, i'm not sure about that."" fuck amazon.

update: i promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. i talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. however, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

i'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an amazon ad, i just wrote it how i wrote it because i thought it was funny. i wish amazon was paying me for this crap. 

i'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. yes i fucked up, i was a dumbass, that's why i posted it here. yes, i should have known this could happen. call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my so do. it's fun. i don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. it happened.

"my parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. i am sick of this shit (florida). for clarity we're both minors. i'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. she has never been right since we were little kids. always violent. she bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when i was 5 because i wouldn't let her ride my bike. all of my life i've been putting up with this shit and i have had enough.

she hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. my parents wont do anything about it. she's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. i really don't know what is wrong with her. she's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. my parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. they refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". which brings us to today. my parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. whatever, not important.

anyway, i was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. we decided to go to the dollar tree to get some snacks. demon didn't buy anything. as we left the store i could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. i confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! i don't know why. don't they make meth out of those or something? so i told her i was going to call mom. i pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! i was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was i going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. i took her down and had her pinned on the ground. that's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will not stop otherwise. i had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. she got me in the throat and i was letting her go! i was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

it took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. it hurts like a bitch. my friend gave me a bunch of tylenol and it still hurts. i came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *i* do to upset her?! i was so angry i told them i was calling the cops and my dad told me i couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! is that true??? 

something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and i'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  please help me. 

update: well shit went down basically how i expected it would. my mom called me very upset that police had came. what happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. i asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her baker acted because i was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and i guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. my mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. she said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved.

"neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the two spaces in front of our home. after asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving all their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.. california here, getting that out of the way. and full disclosure, its not my home. the home belongs to my parents, but i house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus i love my parents and want what's best for them). i will just be saying my home or my driveway so i dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


these neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with all the memories. i thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

my parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. he has it parked in the middle so that it takes up all the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. it has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. why? i don't know. perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. all i know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

i want to also mention they have a full garage. they also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. and a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

i politely asked him to move his car when i saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. he followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. several days later i visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

i spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since i had asked him to move his car as payback. they said he's really mean and to just let it go. this did not sit right to me, so i later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. i explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

bad idea. i assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. i assumed mom would just tell 'billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. turns out he got it from mom and dad. i get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how i did not just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

i didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. my mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an fu to my mom and dad. that's also when their car got keyed

so since i made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. now the parents are retaliating too.they finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. the one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. the beater was moved so its parked on the other side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. sorry for the run-on sentence. did that all make sense? i hope so.

this has been going on for a few weeks now.

is there anything that can be done? my parent's just seem to want to let it go. not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. my parents travel a lot and my work makes it so i cant always be there to sit the house for them. they fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. i used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


tldr - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. the neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. parents fear retaliation.",2
"for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?. for the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. i'll call her princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. she is a medical researcher (studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. i was apprehensive because i know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

we have a 4 bedroom house. me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler freddie. i told sister that princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed ok with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. princess even said it would be ok to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. it's getting a lot colder now and i'd never let freddie sleep outside. 

i told princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

in all honesty i was right in thinking having princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. she goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

she's also rude to my kids. my daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but princess was lovely enough to say that if her bf had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and i had a word with princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. i made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. i also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that i wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. sorry but how can i be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

edit: a lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. i won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. firstly to the people who have claimed i was acting snobby about princess's job. that wasn't the case. i wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that i could say she's ''only a researcher''. on the contrary, i specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. she earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. she just wanted more money to herself. 

also, the people who claim that i was being nasty to her because i didn't like her and things like that. i don't dislike her at all. i was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, i've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. i was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. she has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because princess constantly bullied her. 

regarding the dog's room. there isn't any furniture in freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

and for those who think i was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. we tried our best to make her feel welcome. gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. we gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, i went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. within her first week here, princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

regarding the weed and clubbing thing: i've nothing against weed use. i smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and i'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. if she was doing it away from the house i would not care at all. i wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. i'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. however, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

last but not least, i didn't call her ''princess'' on here offensively. i wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",3
"got a friend or family in the hospital? consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/ereader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.. note: *this is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

i was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. this made me realize what i would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- hospital hvacs systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. i was told they could only bump it up or down here at my va hospital. also, this was the first time i received an iv treatment and let me tell you they are cold... had an iv in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and i am pretty convinced i could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**warm, comfortable socks**- reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *credit*: /u/getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so i followed up and asked my nurse about this.  turns out, the va hospital does have socks available and my new rn was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


**condiments** - i believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. this problem might be compounded by medication. may have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **edit** i recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  generally, it would be wiser to consult with the rn or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**open toe slippers**- luckily i had flip flops on when i was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if i only had tennis shoes. probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**long, braided phone charger** - my wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. i can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. i recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. also, i am using a 5ft usb hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**entertainment**: a book, ereader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   the tv service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. if they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. the gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *edit* /u/stjerndale recommended audiobooks.  great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**gift cards**: *credit: /u/1900grs, /u/halftimeheaters.*  gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*bonus lpt*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  they take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  this bonus lpt is intended for *adult patients.*


edit 1

**power bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  this was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


edit 2

**eye mask & ear plugs** - /u/ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/suedeveil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**moisturizers & chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/fatjennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  i will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing.",9
"the argument ""schools should teach me life skills and not algebra"" is stupid because nobody would pay attention anyways.. our school had a mandatory class on personal finance. nobody cared. not a single kid remembers a thing from that class, and i can almost guarantee that it would be the same way for most other schools. people just wouldn't take it seriously.

let's edit this a bit because people have made some fairly good points. i would say the most of the time, the kid using this argument is the kid who wouldn't pay attention. i hear it a lot from people who are bombing algebra and are just pissed because they don't think it's useful (it might not be but that's not the point). usually, what they're saying is ""i hate algebra"" and trying to sound smart about it.",6
"update: i think my (22m) girlfriend (20f) might be cheating on me with my roommate.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/aj79wj/i\_think\_my\_22m\_girlfriend\_20f\_might\_be\_cheating/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aj79wj/i_think_my_22m_girlfriend_20f_might_be_cheating/)

tldr: my girlfriend was really close with my roommate, i suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

basically, after i kicked my gf out of our party, i assumed we would all lay low for a few days. i was wrong. the day after the party, my roommate (i decided to call him chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but i ignored him. less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing chet couldn't have been avoided, because while i was a good boyfriend, i study and sleep too much. ok. she then told me she would be willing to work through this if i was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. i didn't respond to the text.

that night i had a dinner with my parents i couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. i came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. i figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. wrong. i noticed later when chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into his room.

i haven't seen either of them, i think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. i don't even know how to feel. honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and i'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",8

"by swiping on lesbians on tinder for 2 months.. this has been going on for two months and i just found out today. throwaway account because many know my real account and i don't feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

so i signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. i set up my account...set my interest in 'women' and started swiping. now when i signed up for tinder i linked my facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if i set my gender to woman. i had completely forgot. i'm not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but i was getting barely any matches and couldn't figure out why. figured the algorithms were just screwing me. over the course of the two months i would think ""wow short hair must be the new thing"" or ""so many bisexuals on here"" but never really thought anything beyond that. then this morning i woke up to a new match. she said i looked great, to which i replied thanks, you too! but then she replied with...""how long ago did you transition?"" i thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. that's when it all came together and i realized i've been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

"if you're working in a technical role (it, engineering, etc), write everything you do down as if it was a user manual. ignore those who say it will be used to replace you. it is far more likely to be used to show management ""you can give me that promotion, as the next guy is all set"".. it's also going to help build skills in communicating things clearly, precisely and in a way anybody can understand. you'll also be amazed how many times writing something out instructionally can lead you to think ""wait, why do we do it like that?!"" - identifying opportunities for improvement.

edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. for some extra help / elucidation:

-	i found this very helpful when i was starting my career. the biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out ""on paper"" to better see where things need to change, where i didn't know all i could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	i am indeed now a director. our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. it's those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; i can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. as a manager, it's a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. i'm never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it's because they've found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	most importantly, where i'm from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they've been forced to ""work themselves out of a job"" then they can sue for constructive dismissal. i know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it's not a common motif. as such, i do agree that if you're in a country like india, china, usa, where some of these protections and freedoms aren't so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. in others, like germany, uk, most of scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

but yes, as with anything - this has been an experience i've personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation. i guess as a second tip - if you're working for a company where you feel the management are always trying to find ways to screw you over, maybe it's time to find a new company to work for...",9

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men. it's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. but every woman i have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. and a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

and if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. if men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. but most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. its ludicrous.

tl;dr: women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. this is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. sorry this was so long.

edit: okay obviously i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so i would like to clarify some things. 

1. this thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. i have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. people who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. i am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. but there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. people refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, i think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have a lot to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. it starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",6

"for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after i got rich?. my mom left my dad when i was 17 (i'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. we all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. she had 2 more kids with this guy. 

when my mom and dad broke up i moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. the major reason for this was because she told me to leave as i kept fighting with her new dude. i really did not want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and i was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. when she told me to leave...something in me changed and i am still unable to forgive her. that solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. and my sister and mom were close so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

since i was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc i like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. they gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, i majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. the profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, i'm living a life i never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

i moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. i am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and i'm grateful so much bc i was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

for the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. she is getting increasingly more insistent that i go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. she keeps telling me that 'even if i don't forgive her i should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

because day to day i have no interest in helping her or her family? imo she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. i just can't forgive her though.",3

i'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&#x200b;

pretty soon after i posted, i received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. i knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so i googled the law firm and lawyer's name. i couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so i reached out to them. the letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. they asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. i don't know exactly what's happening as i have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200b;

in other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that i also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. we still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

"by being funnier than my so and allowing her to post it on reddit.. this happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. 

last night while my so was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. she is a bartender and didn't want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. so i jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

while i'm making my journey, i decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. i'm in a pretty great mood. i had the day off and my so was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some new girl. 

my journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. just open desert. so while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. ""what can i do to add a little romance to this situation? cover the bed in some dove chocolates? maybe some flowers?"" 

i make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. miraculously, i made it back home before her.

finally i decide, ""nah, romance isn't nearly as great as comedy."" so when i get home, i break open the box and spell out ""anal?"" on the bed with the tampons. 

so gets home and goes straight to the room to change. i follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

she takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. now she won't stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is ""famous"". 

i've created a monster. 

tldr; spelled out ""anal?"" with my so's tampons. she thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. reddit agreed and now she thinks she's famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.

edit: wow! my first ever medal. thank you kind stranger. now at least i can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.

edit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.

edit 3: we are ending this ""contest"" at 11:59 pst on 7/17/19. it looks like i am going to win but since she is not able to edit/update her original post, i would like to say a few things... i had no clue this would blow up like this. i thought i'd get 10 upvotes and send it to her as a joke when she was being obnoxious about having 2500 more karma than me in the span of a day while i've been in here for a year. this has made our day off together one of the best ones in a while. 

that being said, please go show her some of that love i know reddit is so capable of showing. she is truly my better half and deserves all the attention and happy comments.",4

"for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

so, i got into cornell last week. honestly i think it was fluke. i'm not smart, at all. i got a 28 act, a decent gpa (because my school grade inflates considerably). i had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like cornell. but anyways...

my twin sister is the opposite of me. she's a genius, she has way more impressive stats (34 act and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. i didn't and still don't mind, it's true. the only reason i can fathom i got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while i applied to arts and sciences (i don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (cornell). she checked as soon as it was available and called me bawling. i consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

well anyways, i pretty much resolved that i was getting rejected, so i didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. well, i guess surprises do happen sometime, because i'm a cornellian. i got in. i just don't know how but i did. 

i really want to go guys. but this would devastate my sister. all week she's been crying and solemn and sad. she's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  she's decided to go to nyu, but she just hasn't been herself. i haven't told our parents (i think they assumed i didn't get in because she didn't). 

am i being selfish? should i just go with her to nyc? we always thought we were going to school together but like... it's cornell. i couldn't in a million years imagine i'd get in. i've been researching obsessively about it and i can't shake the desire that if i don't go, i'll regret it. ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which i would love to get away with from the huge city that is new york). it seems like a dream opportunity. 

am i being a bad sister? i know she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. it would crush her. i really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. for going to her dream school? especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

tldr: dumb sister (me) gets into cornell. smart sister didn't. she's depressed. it was her first choice. i want to go tho. aita?

update: so everyone here told me that i should go, so i decided to tell my sister. 

well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't i tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

but seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. she went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. like uncontrollably bawling. i tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

i going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

update 2: please let me know if my updates are annoying; i only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so i thought least i could do is update 

so after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. it said:

> i'm sorry for how i reacted; please don't be mad. i'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. it's just that after i got rejected, i at least had the consolation that i get to go to school with you and we can go together. but now you're going to be where i wanted to be and i'm just so sad. i worked so hard and did everything i could to go to the best school i can and i just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. i'm sorry i'm ranting i just need more time

i'm not going to lie guys, when i read this, i cried. a lot of you are saying that i obviously i have to have attributes that made me desiresble but i really don't. i don't deserve my acceptance. i did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest ap classes available, etc. meanwhile i see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. she deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. i'm really strongly just considering going to nyu with her. everyone at cornell will just be just like her and i don't stand a chance. and i know if i go to cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and i just don't want to lose my sister :(

update 3: so i told my parents and they did not react how i would've expected them to. first, they tried to insist that cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be impossible; if we applied to the same school within cornell, like we both applied to arts and sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. they couldn't have mixed them up). 

then they went on to explain how i should go to nyu with my sister. i thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to cornell if i didn't get in. my sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would i not go to cornell, and they said how it was unfair that i basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. i don't know if i'm being dramatic, but that hurt. i knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that i don't deserve my spot sucks. even though they're probably right.

i stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. she asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that i 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. my parents were shocked because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. this started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. i'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. i realize that i have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. i'm glad i have my sister actually believe in me.

i still don't know if i want to go to nyu or cornell, mostly because i just don't want to go to school without her. she's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. at the end of the day, i always thought the nyu was going to be the school i was going to, so i wouldn't lose much by choosing it over cornell. i'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. thanks again everybody for your comments; i wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that i got in.

update 3.5: no new news but i just wanted to say that i'm reading every single comment and i apologize if i don't get to you individually and i appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! you guys are amazing :)",3

"watching incest porn. *throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

this happened yesterday. i was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. i will state, for the record, i do not advocate incest. my girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. all i wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so i went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. that's all this was. research. 

so, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. of all people. if there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment i look straight into it. i answered the phone. the old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

cut to my dad and i driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. then, there came the silence. it wasn't the awkward kind. but i guess we just kinda said enough at the time. my father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. he was in the mood to get jiggy with jeezy. but instead of hearing voices worshipping the og upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital q&a: 

*""you like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

my old man unknowingly activated the car's bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever i was listening to last. in this case, it was fucking incest porn. now, i never closed the video before i left the house, but i did pause the motherfucker. yet, somehow, my phone went skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. it was my dog. i should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

i called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. i told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation i all but confirmed it. here's the problem, when i asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because i took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". i told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

i found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. i found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. she is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

i'm pissed right now and don't know what to do. that dog lived with me for over 5 years since she was a puppy and now because they've had her for three weeks they think they get to keep her. what can i do? i have all of the papers that prove i own her (dog licence, proof of ownership, medical records, etc) and she is chipped. i also have that police report. what do i need to do to get my dog back?",2

"the best thing you can ever do for a box cake mix is use real butter instead of oil, milk instead of water, and add one extra egg.. the difference those 3 small changes make in terms of moisture and texture is amazing. turn that $2 box mix into a $100 professional bakery dupe and no one but you has to know.

edit: since this has blown up beyond anything i could have expected, i feel the need to address a couple of things. there are about 1000 of you screaming ""just make it from scratch!"" and y'all are missing the point. whether you love it or hate it, box cake mix is a thing, and they're extremely popular. millions of people use them all the time. they use them because they're easy, inexpensive, and accessible. there are 8 billion people on this planet and not everyone knows how to bake. not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. and that's ok. but for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point. all i did was mention a couple of easy things to improve on that that people might not know *because maybe no one had told them before now.* some of y'all are getting awful snobby about cheap cake and it's not a good look. 

second, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda. and you know what? that's fantastic! if you have something that makes baking easier or makes a cake that you think is delicious, then do it! you bake that cake! baking should be enjoyable, and if it's delicious then why does it matter how you get there? everyone has to start somewhere so play around with it, experiment, learn what you like, and what works for you. have fun with it. it's just cake.",9
"if i quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? i would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. ex wife as well.. so years and years of backstory here. ex wife has bpd and life with her has been a continuous struggle. we are in the middle of a divorce because while she's lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. but she crossed that line and enough was enough. divorce is bitter and ugly. 

for financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. i implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. the both blew me off and ""yeah yeahed"" me for almost a year. ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. then getting mad at me when i said i had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

i've had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. on a lark i called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in nm. he said i'm hired. i talked to my partner and he'd gladly buy my half of the business. with the 50% id have to give my ex wife i could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. i could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

kids would be cut off. i wouldn't be able to afford any help. they have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. but they'd have to grow up and fast.

would i be the asshole if i do this?",3

hello everyone, i said that i'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response i got yesterday. in many ways, i was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but i found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200b;

i spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. he basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. we had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning i went back to the flat and confronted her. she was there (neither i nor her work on saturdays), and i set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner i could.

&#x200b;

 basically, i said that i didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. the wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. she basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". look, i'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. i basically said that over the weekend i'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (i'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but i stood my ground and didn't change my course. not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200b;

i left, and there is nothing much more to say really. as i type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). i'll be grand, being totally frank i feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  the coming days i'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"".

"insecure gf caught flirting. throwaway for obviousness. this is gonna be a long one. 

where to begin? girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. friends, coworkers, acquaintances. even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

fine. i love her. i understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it's not that big of a deal even though i've lost sleep over it. 

girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. one of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. while i can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. some of these stories i've never heard before. call it insecurity but i've never asked a woman if she's had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. i asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she's put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. what?

a few days roll by and she's continued these talks with this person. we've had our arguments and came to an understanding of 'if he does or says anything that crosses a line' she will end the friendship. 

but where is the line? he's already had her describe herself. explain past relationships. sex talk and favorite kinks. taking until hours in the morning. where is the fucking line?

i told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me i have nothing to worry about. 

well. 

i just looked at her phone.

and while i wish i didn't. i'm glad i can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. they've been flirting. the questions via text were 10x worse. and her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her s/o. 

but what's worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that i'm being insecure and allow him to chime in that i'm creating disorder. then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. and her saying yes. 

not even 2 full days into 2019 and i'm about to break up with my girlfriend over a dude she met online not even 3 days ago. 

username checks out. 

do i ask for advice now or am i on the right track. i need clarity...

thank you for making it this far.

"for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?. my sister is 16 and heavily overweight. she's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. she's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! i'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the edm and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely hated it all. the other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

as a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago i decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. for breakfast i made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. i make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. i mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. i have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

it was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. she started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where i told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (she thinks apple pie is healthy???) my mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but i really think i was making an honest effort to help? i feel bad for yelling at my mom but i dunno, was i really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**edit:** i really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. i just want to emphasize that i'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, i just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. i will try to be more self-informed in the future. i've taken note of her possibly having arfid, thyroid problems, or pcos and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, i feel bad that i've made such a horrible impression of her. she has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, i made a comment on this post detailing how i did the cheese sauce and stuff. thank you very much for your suggestions, i really appreciate them.

update #2 following monday's notre dame game:

leading up to monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download snapchat, which i had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. i bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. he has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

anyway, so monday rolls around, i'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. i knew he'd have other friends there, all of which i'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. i get over there around 2. he has one friend already there and is expecting more. they trickle in and i'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. we cut up after the game, played some pool, james had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. i was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so i could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what i did. i did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. after some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

i asked james if we could talk outside. we walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""i know i kissed you the other day, and i don't know if that was something i should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. i've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and i think i may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" i was absolutely out there now. no turning back, i basically just told him i had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. he didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why i haven't brought it up before now. obviously i told him i had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the kiss! he reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. i could come to him with whatever was on my mind and i just teared up. it wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. i gave him a hug and told him i appreciated that, we sat down and i explained to him how confused i've been these last couple weeks. how this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. i sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. he is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things i said, they were all comforting. he told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. he is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. a few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.i don't know what i would call the gut feeling i had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out with him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  i felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. i have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. he explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but i shouldn't be pressured. i wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. i turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. full on made out for what seemed like ever. it was the most satisfying kiss i've ever had. this where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) i'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

by this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and i had to go. he walked me to my car and we made out a second time before i got in. he told me to get home safe and i did. i texted him to let him know i got home safe and hopped in the shower. i was so emotionally charged that i couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am. i ended up calling out of work tuesday. james and i have plans to hangout again this weekend. he wants to go out for food and a place called topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, i've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. i'm really looking forward to it and i'm just taking things day to day at this point. i know where we stand and i'm happy.

thank you for all of your support. i have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. i just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. you only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. i am learning this myself and i'm telling you, it's liberating.

i'll post any other updates here, above this one.  if anything big happens in the meantime i will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csi07o/41m_questioning_sexuality_after_making_a_new/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. i was very observant in our interactions, however, i didn't want to be so observant that i overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so i went with the flow and the vibes were great. we hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when i had the opportunity in conversation i mentioned that i had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and i told him that although i hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and i thought i might be curious to try it. i delivered this passively, just so not to put him on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. it felt like the time to make a move but i just didn't do it. we were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and i just didn't do it. it was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time i've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) we got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new nba 2k20 demo on ps4, i'll admit i'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but i kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. at the end of the night, around 11p i went to leave, i had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. i went in for our hug, when i pulled back i kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and i laid it on him, i went right in and kissed him. it was short, i didn't use much tongue, but i pulled back and said ""i guess i can say i've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, i guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, i had one on mine and it was fireworks in my stomach. i played it cool, i left and texted him when i got home that i was home safe and i thanked him again for a good time. he replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. he asked if i wanted to come over monday night for the notre dame game and a cook out, i told him i'd love to and i'll bring some ribs to cook.

we have texted as normal today and i can't tell you how excited i am for monday and to see what happens next. i know i waited awhile to update but i felt like i had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so i wanted to wait until i had more to report. i will post another update in the comment section here after monday.

thank you so much to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. i feel like i'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41.",8
"by looking up my school bully. so a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when i was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. i struggled like hell because i didn't speak a single word of english. the school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while i was there). anyway, i tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. one guy just completely hated my guts from day one. no idea why or what i did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. so that's he kind of person i'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my english in class, in front of the teachers and all. there was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while i was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. i naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. when to leave school and which exist to use. where to sit in class etc. once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. i just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  the only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. i would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. karma has to work right? the world can't be that unfair. 

fast forward 15 years. i haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. i didn't make any friends and i didn't develop stockholm's. i looked him up on facebook. 

he owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. he lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. he is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. this has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and i just can't get over the bullshit i was fed, karma will get him for you. i think karma missed.

"aita: for not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?. i (f20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

the last time i lived here was 2-3 years ago. back then i remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn't want her boys to see it. 

now it's not like i was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

anyway i never stopped using the toilet bin. 

now i'm back she's started a new thing. moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that i keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when i'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

i personally think i absolutely should not be hiding the fact i have a vagina and it bleeds. her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. i would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. and i just want to be comfortable in the house i'm living in.

edit: for more info, this isn't a random house i've moved back into. i've lived here since i was 3 before my parents got divorced when i was 7. my step mum and her kids moved in when i was 12(ish). i moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. 

so this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.",3
"by rubbing my ass into a security guard's crotch... out of habit.. normally, students can beep into my school with an id card.

it's rfid, and pretty reliable, so most people don't take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.

i'm a junior, and i've been getting into the building the same way for years. i keep my id card in my back pocket, so i just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. that sounds a little weird to write, but i promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and i'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.

only issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. as a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our id out to show him as we walked in.

coming in at 8:00am, after years of habit... i was on autopilot.

i approached the security guard, he said, ""id?"" and i nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (obviously i didn't hear the beep, so i guess my brain thought i wasn't close enough to the ""reader""?)

it all took about two seconds, and when i felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, i suddenly realized what i was doing... but before i could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all ""woah woah woah! miss! i just the need the id, please, not a lap dance!"" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.

i tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. couple of other students saw so i'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.

tl;dr: decided i could bribe my way into school without an id by giving the security guard a lapdance... i was right.",4
"my (18m) girlfriend (f17), is threatening to kill herself every time i express discomfort, and today when i got angry at her and ignored her texts, she sent me videos of her cutting herself. i feel extremely trapped at this point. she was such a great person when i met her and i thought we would be great together.

unfortunately, for the past month, she's started to insult me for everything. for example, i could not hear a line of what she said over facetime because of internet issues and she flipped saying i don't pay attention to her. proceeded to call me names or whatnot. usually, i just took and it moved on. however, today i just snapped and told her to leave me alone. so i proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and i check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

i just ignore it because i really did not feel like it.  then she tells me she's bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. i honestly think i'm traumatized from those videos, i can't seem to get them out of my head and i feel responsible for them. i texted her father, however it was late so he's asleep. thankfully she's still alive and i've managed to calm her down by apologizing, but i don't feel right. 

i feel trapped, and very fucking sad. i feel as if i'm a monster and i'm causing her to do these things to herself. i never say anything badly to her, i just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. i apologize for my rant but i don't know. my emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

i hope i can get some advice. for some insight, i don't ever insult her, not even jokingly. she gets annoyed that i don't give her attention, but i text her and hang out with her as much as i can possibly give, i am human and a student with responsibilities, i can't spend 24 hours with her.  

that's really all. 

update: 
just a slight update. i have been in contact with her father and i am being updated on what's happening. they are seeking professional help for her and i feel that is the right choice for her. i am very exhausted and haven't really slept, so i'll try and give updates as i can. fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm. in my case, i've decided it's going to do me harm if i continue keeping her in my thoughts and anywhere in my life. 

my mental state was much more positive and happy before this, and i'd much rather regain my positive nature. i am very appreciative of everyone in my messages expressing their own dealings with similar circumstances. i've read every story and the decision i made has been influenced by your own experiences. i will try and reply to all the messages, but i apologize if i miss anything. i'll keep you guys updated if anything new comes up. i have decided to move on with my life and and get therapy to help me through this, and i hope she comes to see what i chose to do a few years from now.

thank you!
if my spelling or grammar sucks, i'm pretty exhausted, i apologize.

"update: my landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. wtf do i do.. because i know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  you all helped break the cycle of panic.

original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  it was my roommate saying my landlord had said i couldn't hospice there.

yeah.  i know.

i specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding i would be dying in this house.  i'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  and i guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  so instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""you can't do in-home hospice here"".  


obviously this is super illegal (thanks, la!), and i call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

i started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after i threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and i call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what i was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

so yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because i subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  my attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  everybody wins?  

except i still gotta die, yo.  after i move lol.  at least i can afford it i guess.  :( 

thanks la.   ",2

"by asking for vagina in a japanese convenience store. for context, i'm on a vacation to japan and has been staying at my friend's apartment for 3 days. to show a bit of gratitude, i wanted to cook for her so i decided to go for something simple like a chicken katsu.

i've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. this is the moment i realized that i was out of breadcrumbs so i have to go to the convenience store to get some. i am somewhat decent in japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? no.

as i walked in the store, i couldn't find the breadcrumbs i was looking for so i decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

me: ""sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

at this point i didn't realize that i mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". the staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking i was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. i repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. after the change of the staff's expression, i realized that i fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. i then explained that i mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

"my f28 mil won't take my kid's 4 anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously. **update at bottom of post.**

i'll try to keep this as short as possible. sorry for mobile formatting. i've never really seen eye-to-eye with my mil because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... i understand that children need discipline, but i prefer a gentler approach with my son. i've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists i let it go, so i've tried to. 

until now. my son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. she insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that i'm just babying him. i've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

she has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. i told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying i accused her of being an unfit grandmother. which i admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

now my husband wants me to apologise to her. he says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that i'm overreacting. i kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is of the essence because it happens so quickly. 

so, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

she's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a lot of peanuts, everywhere. i asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

i'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a mama's boy who thinks mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. he says he turned out just fine being raised by her and i worry too much. 

would it be awful if i insist she only see him if i'm present? am i completely unreasonable and overreacting? is there anything else i can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**edit/mini-update**: first of all, woah. i did not expect this to get so much attention. thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. in case you missed it: i've left for now, removed my son from the situation, and i'm now currently staying at my brother's house. at least for a few days until things cool off and i'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. in the mean time, i've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. my husband has been to the same appointments i have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

some people have accused me of being a helicopter mom, or trying to demonize my mil. and given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe i'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then i'm okay. i'm not even a sahm, we have an incredible nanny while i work ft, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. in the past, i've tried my best for my mil to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, i've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. but i'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

lastly, i just want to say my mil has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. she won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. so, i don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. she's very strong in her beliefs. i did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. my husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so i told him to find time or he won't be getting any time with my son until he does. if he's going to be so careless, i'll end up dealing with this legally. 

thanks again everyone. words can't express my gratitude. i will update with a new thread eventually.",8
"for telling my daughter 26f that i 55m will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad 50m.. my wife and i divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since i was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. i knew from many stories i've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. this may sound immature but i made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that i was her only father and to not betray me. but i have no control over what she or they do in their home. fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. she has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me i would be the one to do it. even though i know they're very close, i don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. i am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. i got a bit angry and told her i absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy i barely know. she told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that i'm being petty over something that happened years ago. i told her i wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but i won't be there to see it. 

i was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so i wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",3

okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. i'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

a friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. she had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. i don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do i even really know the full story yet. she is not really the prank playing type and i guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

it looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. after i started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. i guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

anyway, i texted her and i told her that i knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. she started blowing my phone up apologizing. she said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. she also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that i was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

i just didn't really respond to her. i left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. my family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. i'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

i don't really know where to go from here. i don't know if i should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

i'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. i'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as i'm awake with this jameson.

"my mom took 15.000 out of my savings to pay for a new car, i need advice. so i will try and keep this short.

i have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced i chose to live with her, i have always trusted her and so on.

now we have never been rich, but we got by, i have always worked since i could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

now because of this i quickly started saving my money, pretty much, i would usually save up at least half of what i made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when i moved out and such.

so i turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so i wanted to see how much i had saved.

well you can see where this is going, i looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so i freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so i yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. she started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. i know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, i mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. my dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

well this was 2 weeks ago, i have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

in the meantime i have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

now here is what i said, untill i have every penny back i wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do i doubt i will ever forgive her. i need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",8

my father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. they have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. that plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. i had been arranged to join the kids' group, when i tried to protest they insist that i am a ""kid"" too, so i just had to submit to my fate. clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


so i spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. that includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to science park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. to be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when i sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(i admit, i am not really babysitter material). the kids seem to like me, so i guess it went well too. however, i still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


when my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. now, i don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes i can easily earn in a few hours, but i am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, i was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


i put on the biggest smile i and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. they were a little taken aback. i said as sweetly as i could that i deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. in all awkwardness i got my pocket money. needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


i got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. in their words, i am a major ah to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. aita?",3

"my (22m) gf(26f) of 5 years killed my pet snake (14 yo) as soon we moved in together. update on the bottom

update #2 on the bottom

update #3 on the bottom

so i'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that i had since i was kid. 

she always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

but to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. he has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

when we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but i couldnt cuz i really love my snake.

well now i came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

when i confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

i find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and i doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

i dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

i wanna confront her about it but i dont wanna seem like im being petty

edit: when i brought up the snake missing she just started crying and saying i always do this?? idek what she even means by this



update: she dmd me this (im out rn)

update 2: i went to the lake to search with my friend i was chilling with, couldn't find the snake, and talk to the gf. were currently on break but were in the same house... not sure how thats gonna pan out

update 3: didnt sleep all night, went to the lake (15 minute drive), and i found the snake but unfortunatly it looks like it got attacked by another animal as it has huge marks on him and looks impaled. well with the gf, i am going to break up with her and go no contact but right now i have to find a way to get my name off lease papers and other documents too

"tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto, ontario

i own an apartment in downtown toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with airbnb tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until january.

i decided to list my place up for a rental in late august, for rental until janaury. since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). i immediately got a hit by a person named jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.she signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""no short term rentals, through services such as airbnb"".

yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* on monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. along with a strong smell of pot. they apparently identified themselves as airbnb renters. (apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through airbnb).
* i am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* i am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

after getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on airbnb, using very recent photos of my apartment. i tried to contact jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

i have tried numerous times to talk to airbnb, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*edit\* i forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. i want to stop randoms from airbnb from entering my apartment now. ",2

"by buying a used playstation 2 on letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.. this happened only minutes ago.


the graphics card in my old ps2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so i decided to replace it when i had a little extra cash. i was out browsing different sites like craigslist and the like, when i stumbled upon the ps2 mentioned in the title. it looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


at the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


now, i should preface this by saying that i have a strange faith in the honesty of others. benefit of the doubt and all that noise. after all, the car i drive now is one i bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. why should this be any different?


starting to sound like a mistake yet?


if the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. that is almost certainly about to change. the model the seller advertised on letgo was one of the larger black brick models. like, the first generation ones. when i finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. when he showed me the goods, it was actually one of the slim and silver ps2's from later in the console's production run. he told me he had already sold the larger one.


my first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that i should have walked away when i saw i was being sold something that was improperly advertised. unfortunately for me (and i guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), i was not in the most logical mood. it was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. i just wanted to get this thing and go home.


back at the ole ranch, i hooked up the console, slapped in kingdom hearts ii, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. i'm off work and done with class, what else would i do with my evening, right? i was pretty happy with my life until i realized i had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. strange, but not altogether discouraging. i slapped in another game that i new for sure was working. didn't read. i repeated this several times with discs i knew would work; same story.


now i'm starting to get slightly pissed. i'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


i open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. i've now got no way to contact him. of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. all i could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. that, or i could get onto youtube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. i picked the latter option and went on my merry way. after a video about a quick mod i could make to the system, i was feeling pretty confident that i was going to get the last laugh on this one.


oh golly gee fuck was i wrong.


now at this point, i begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. i manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. it's putting up a little more of a fight than i saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? it was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. with a little elbow grease, it starts to give. i'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. a bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so i can live with that. the further i get it open, the more rust i see on some more critical pieces. i'm sweating again, but holding out hope. finally, the plastic casing comes free, and i experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


i experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


you see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. the first thing i notice is that the inside is covered in rust. the second thing i notice is that some of the rust is moving.


oh, that's not all rust.


*ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


do you know that scene in raiders of the lost ark where indiana jones is like, ""snakes. why did it have to be snakes?"" that was me. except with cockroaches. they are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. and now they're crawling on my hands. and these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. i threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


they're getting everywhere now. i'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. you would think that something caught fire with the way i was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. tiny, $25 freaks of nature. eventually i managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point i grabbed a can of raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


at least, i *hope* i finished the job. i'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point i'm a little too emotionally drained to care. i also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that i *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and i already need a stiff drink.


tl;dr: i bought a used ps2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

"tifu by telling my gf to go right.. i finally get to post a fuck up. happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

my gf and i were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. awful game by the way. anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. the gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

the star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

as she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

which she immediately did.

i have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and i've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. nor have i ever been so afraid. she ended the game with 0 stars...

""i will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

the rest of the game was spent in dread. its now 3am and i'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

goodbye.

tl;dr mario party 7 is a terrible game.",4
"my 26f girlfriend 24f thinks she's an instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy!. when i met my girlfriend 3 years ago, i knew very quickly she was addicted to instagram. she was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

this didn't really bother me at first - i actually found it kind of hot? mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - i felt, i guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then i think).

other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. every day is punctuated by ""insta time"" where i'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for instagram content... it's ridiculous. we've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, i'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. i'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

it was routine stuff, i asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

so the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. she desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. she's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but i didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for ig, she was actually trying to make money from it. i know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. before you say it - yes, i'm probably going to break up with her. but the thing is, she's got a really good heart and i genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). is there anything i can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",8
"for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?. title says it all. my friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. she dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have candy crush on her phone.

so i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

after dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

edit: yep, i'm reading the replies, all 3k of them, it's all very interesting. not gonna reply to any because reddit people can be weird, i know if i reply to a yta with anything other than ""i'm sorry you're right"" people will say ""accept your judgment!"" and if i reply ""thanks"" to an nta i will be told i'm just looking for validation.

i get it, people like feel good stories, but this ain't it people. they're doing it to gain clout and be seen as such a great person by sacrificing a classmate who's already in a tough situation. if you're really trying to make a positive impact on someone in that situation, help them in private - at least spare their pride.",6

"the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action tx. when i was 14, i was raped by a close family friend. i got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when i was 15. i knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but i did not know their names or what they were like. we received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. i do not remember signing anything.  i do not know what happened to the friend; i asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. my mother said he was jailed but i don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. i  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. my husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&#x200b;

a month ago, i received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. i believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. she told me that she wanted to get to know me. i spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. i found myself disgusted by her. there are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. she is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. i decided that i would not be comfortable meeting her. i blocked her without responding. after a week, i began to receive letters from her. four letters in total. i did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. i finally answered. i told her that i was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or i would get the police involved.

&#x200b;

she  began to berate me. she told me  that my family was her family. she accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that i had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that i had held back important information. without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  she told me that she would be making contact with my family whether i liked it or not. she also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if i did not comply and that i could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. when i began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. if i agreed to pay for a round of ivf, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. here are my questions:

&#x200b;

1. does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if i tell her to stay away?
2. could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. my parents are dead and i do not know how to find out information about the adoption. i did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. i am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. could i be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. i have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. could i form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if i agreed to pay?

edit: amount asked for was removed. also, because several people have asked: i do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. it only stopped once i left the state. i am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and i will need to move again.

he's got a twin sister. i told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. my son picked one up and said ""i want to wear this."" i'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. i'm pretty politically neutral so while i wouldn't say i was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that i could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

i figured ok, i wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so i shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

i drop him off and get to work. three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. he was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him.

ever since i moved out and laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. she's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

i am fine with what laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

i tried to talk about this privately to laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. my son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. the moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. people were obviously listening and when i gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because i was jealous of her confidence. to make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that i was a piece of shit for saying what i was. my son and i left in tears but laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

ever since then i've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and i was a bad person for asking laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. i'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if i've gotten old and out of touch. it just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. for speaking to my ex this way?",3

so we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then i heard some bagpipe music was playing.

i thought hmm interesting...not what i expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in scotland and the capital city i really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

about an hour in i was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but i was waiting for the red hot chili peppers to come out so i could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

i turned to the man next to me and asked when the red hot chili peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

it was at this moment i realised i was not going to see the red hot chili peppers.

tl;dr: bought tickets to the red hot chili pipers thinking it was the red hot chili peppers.

"by announcing to my daughter that i only shave my vag when her dad is due home. this literally just happened about an hour ago and had me and my husband alternating between cringing in embarrassed, and giggling like a couple of immature schoolchildren.

for context, my husband works away at sea for weeks at a time; he is due to leave later today, so is busy getting organised and packed up ready to go. 

he realised that he had ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that i am, i offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland.
he commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and i assured him that that wouldn't be the case as i use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come. 

tl;dr basically the title, and the fact that my 13-year-old daughter has learnt a bit more about her mother than probably either of us are comfortable with her knowing.

"divorce on table because husband and i cant agree on baby's name. hello reddit. this title might look funny but its an actual problem between me (23f) and my husband (24m). 
we've been dating for a year, been married for 2 years. i got pregnant like 7 months ago so recently we started discussing name for the baby. ever since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name. its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most. in the beginning of our relationship we had may problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. he really loved her and he never hid that from me but i thought it was over once she moved away. now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and i can name the second child. when i asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didnt work out doesnt mean he doesnt want something to keep reminding him of her. he doesnt understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. 
is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name our child like that.

"by masturbating in front of my entire family. this happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which i was extremely anxious about. all together, i was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager i am, i often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

so, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, i lay down in my living room with my family, watching tv. i dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since i had done next to no study at the time). 

not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, i decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

and so off i went. except i forgot one thing.

i was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that i was not in fact sitting with my family by our tv, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

i don't really understand how or why it happened. a few seconds in and i began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

i snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment i put myself in. 

i'm not going to talk about what happened next, as i don't want to relive the next few moments.

my father is just disappointed. he hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

my mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as i write this. 

and i'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. i find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe i was just dreaming while i was gassed up. 

but it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

tl:dr returned from dentist gassed up, beat my meat while in front of my whole family, i now live in shame.",4
"for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them?. i (23m) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

now one of the housemates, we'll call cliff (23m). i call him cliff because he reminds me heavily of brad pitt's character in once upon a time in hollywood. cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and pretty much the poster boy for ""strong silent type"". he doesn't talk much and is mysterious, but he's also very confident. 

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

now the three girls i live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

"for catfishing my underaged sister on tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?. last week, i was using my sister ashley's phone because mine was dead and i needed to call a friend to confirm plans. dialing my friend's number, i saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. immediately, i asked why she's on tinder (she's 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said ""none of your business"" 

i decided that i wanted to have a little fun with this. i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she's just swiping for fun?) so i didn't want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. to test if she was just using for fun, i decided i was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. i asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) kevin if he'd mind if i used his pictures and explained the situation. he thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

i created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister's account. her age was set to 19 (lie, she's still in **high school**) so i was definitely more suspicious of her now. i superliked and less than an hour later, she matched and messaged me. 

i decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for sunday afternoon and told her we could ""head to my place afterwards"". she was completely receptive and said she'd meet me there. she told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

after she left, i told our parents everything and showed them all of the messages. they were pissed, and i suggested we all go to the restaurant. my dad and i just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for ""jim"". my dad went up to her and said ""jim's not coming"" and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. i told her that there was no jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. my dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger's* place. we were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

i told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said i was a ""fucking dick"" and ""cruel"" to her. my other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. wondering who's right and if i went too far?

edit: yes, when i asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would've had sex with jim. that's why i went the extent that i did.

alright after reading all these judgments, i came to the conclusion that i'm ta. but i'm ta she needed. if anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.

"by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner. happened about a week ago, but i've been hesitant to post this as i wasn't sure if it really fits. no one involved in this story is a minor. tl;dr at bottom.

i am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. there are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. we were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iphone. she was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""what?"" the collective asked.

""there's some dude's dick here!""

we gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). we laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. we looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. we also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. we couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

before i turned the setting off, everyone using my family icloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos i saved to my phone. this got annoying after my mom started questioning things i had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so i turned it off.

without thinking of the consequences, i asked her if she shared an icloud account with anyone. she said she shared one with her parents. she got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

i've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. the rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. we sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

the image is burned into all of our minds. i've never met her father but i'm terrified one day i will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and i'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

tl;dr: friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, i can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through icloud, and now none of us are okay.

"found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens. this has been going on for several years. i live in a small rural neighborhood with an hoa where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. as with most hoas, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. there will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. it really annoys my husband. i just laugh at it

well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. there were a lot of emails sent about this. a lot of drama. i don't remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

so then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. some people thought it could be deer eating them. there were several theories. the next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. this year it started happening again and people flipped out. all caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

it started out being funny because i'm not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. but this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

so anyway, you already know what happens. i walk down to the bottom of our property that i don't visit often and i find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

i went inside and told my husband jokingly ""i think we're being framed for the onion heist!"" he got this really weird look on his face and i had the realization and asked him if he didn't have anything to do with this

he confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. he was sneaking out at night to do this. i asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

i don't even know. this makes me really uncomfortable. the man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and i didn't even notice? why wouldn't he just tell me? like this has been going on for three years it's not like he just did it once as a prank

i don't know what to do. can anyone help me think this through. maybe i'm overreacting but i'm pretty upset

"my daughter is dying of complications from cancer. my wife and i don't agree on final interventions. how do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this?. i apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. too much ugly crying.

we have been battling cancer for many months now. her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. she could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. the other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

if she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt cpr. we have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

if she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. on top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

i don't want either of these interventions as i feel she has gone through enough. my wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. i don't want her to suffer any more.

i don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. we have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. a part of me feels like a pos for not wanting to try anything but i just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

what do i do to find common ground. i tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. my wife and i have agreed on a plan. we are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. please support childhood cancer research. no parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: i appreciate all the advice and i want to give another update. firstly, my daughter is only 5. i don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. either way this all happened rather quickly. last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. she was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called vod which came on her very quickly. within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

she does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. the medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. she has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

my wife and i decided to try intubation again but say no to cpr. she was intubated a couple hours ago. so far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. both my wife and i are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. we'll take all the positive energy we can get.",8

i'm happy he is rid of that predator but i'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

"by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother. now this didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and i am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

so, a few weeks ago i was at my gf's house, usually the plan when i go is i sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch tv, play games and other stuff. everything was normal, i chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general tv.

this is where the fuck up happens.

after around an hour or so, me and my gf were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

i'm enjoying this more than i ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since i started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

she starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. literally within less than 30 seconds, i'm already ready to release my load, i try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but i just can't, it feels too good. 

right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst i'm there in my birthday suit. my girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock i release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

i sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. my girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then i hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

although me and my gf are still together, i haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

tl;dr - gf was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and i ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit.",4

&#x200b;

i had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but i still swiped out of boredom. they were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. only boob. there was no picture of her husband. i take a few shots and message them.  after like an hour of talking, i decide to just do it. we never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. she wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. at first i was like really not for it, i originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and i was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. at 2am i left the house, and this is where i regret everything.

&#x200b;

after driving for about an hour, i miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped two of my tires. i'm in a shitty ghetto town that i've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how i'm getting home now. i thought i was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. but since there was no turning back now, i decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

the husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as i see him, my gut and inner voice are screaming at me, don't do this, turn back. and i wish i had listened. for reasons unknown, i followed him into the house. it was pitch black, not a single light was on. he lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. i was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. if there was ever a time i disassociated, it was then and there. it was no longer me behind the wheel. the dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. does anybody remember the scene in blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? that was what i saw. a disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. i was horrified but at the same time, i didn't care. they both fucking stink, that was one of the worst things. the smell took forever to wash off my hands after. months later i'll get a whiff out of nowhere. that disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

i take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking the entire time, like fucking gollum. saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. look at that beautiful pussy. ain't she so fuckin wet?"" nonstop. meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. like i said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, i managed to perform to a degree but i never did finish. it probably didn't help i was wearing a condom but i'm extremely glad i was. the entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""how the fuck am i getting home? this smell is going to kill me. how do i end this? how do i get out of here?""

i decided it was time, i had to get the fuck out of there asap. i told them i couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. they insisted i put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. i just wanted to make it look like i at least tried. if the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. i pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. i stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. i politely reiterated i wasn't going to be able to finish. i blamed it on my tires being popped and i was too tired. they were cool about it, and i quickly gathered my things and left.

i barely had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. so we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. my hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers i took and how many times i washed them. i blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what i did. it took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200b;

tldr; drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

"i got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. after 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. i need help on how to handle this.. 
i am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

at 16 i slep with my good friend jared . the condom broke and my daughter was created. my parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. i couldn't bring it over myself to. i wanted to keep the baby. ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. so i did. i went to my friends house and his parents took me in. they weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

in that time my friend and i started to develop feelings for each other.

i had my daughter and about 2 moths later jared's  brother  came back into their life's. he was a recovering heroin addict. as we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. my parents got wind of that. they dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my mil also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

so they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. it was a dark time i thought they were going to take my baby. in the end they didn't find anything substantial.

but them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. as it was a small town every mistake i made got back to my parents.

i was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? cps charges because neglect.
i was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . cps.

christmas loads of people stayed at jared's house because it was a big family. cps because many strange men were there.

they eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. if they had done it more i think it could have been an offence.

the last call was 5 years ago.

eventually jared and i married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. we worked retail jobs and studied. it took us longer than average to graduate but we did. with a lot of help of his parents. jared is now an engineer and i work as a graphic designer.

we were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. our life's look normal now.

anyway a week ago i get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

i don't really know what to do. because while they didn't have to take care of my while i was pregnant i wished they had at least supported me. and while i get that they were panicking because they thought i was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",8

"boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, i was not raped.. i am in boston but my abortion happened in new york city. i was 18 and this was completely legal. 

i'm 18 and in college. like all 18 year olds, i mess up. i messed up big time and i ended up pregnant. i waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, i went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and i took a couples' trip to nyc so i could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

we got back to boston and life went on. i am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. i have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, i'm not considered depressed, i have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. i receive my therapy in a non religious environment. this is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before i went to college, my parents are toxic, and i needed help with that burden. 

i told my therapist immediately that i'd had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, i go to a university that i worked my ass off to get into and i'll be damned if i let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. i also could not raise a child that i disdained. selfish? yes. but i'm not sorry). i also informed her that my boyfriend and i are still together and that he and i plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. he and i split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

i go home and do homework. at around 4 pm, i get a visit from the boston police who are investigating a rape. they think that i'm the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that i've been forced to have an abortion, i ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and i agreed that abortion was the way to go. after a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

then i get a call from my parents. they're ranting on and on about how i've gotten an abortion and sinned in god's eyes, how i've been fornicating and screwed every man in nyc, and how my lack of contact (i'm nc with them because of abuse and they're narcissists) is killing my mother. they screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they've been given my address in boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

it becomes clear. my therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (i never gave her their number, address, or personal information. she did not know their names, i only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that i'd been raped and gotten an abortion. 

i never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. i never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when i mentioned the sex, i called it ""consensual sex"". the police are still hounding me, i'm freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by continuing to knowingly provide false information to the police (although i gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that i have stockholm syndrome and that's why i won't report my boyfriend, and i'm at a loss for what to do. 

i also know why she's having some weird witch hunt. my boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, i was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). i was not and in the session i said specifically told her that i never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that i was raped at his fraternity house. 

i've also started to get calls from the nypd investigating the ""forced abortion"" and i'm freaking out and don't know what to do. this is serious. 

at this point in time i know that i need to get the police off my butt. is there a way that would help me? is a lawyer the best way to go? also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? is there a way to make sure she doesn't do this again? 


edit: when the cops came the first time, i told them that she was completely falsifying everything and i gave them evidence. she is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so i'm not taken seriously. the last time the cops called was last night.

"if i played ""another one bites the dust"" at my brother's wake?. my brother died. he was an incredible, funny guy, i miss him like i lost one of my limbs. maybe it's stupid, but i want people to remember the person he was. my dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very catholic funeral service. he wasn't catholic and wouldn't like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn't know there. he'd think it's way too fancy, way too much. 

he and i had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, i guess). he told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""it's raining men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""highway to hell"" and ""another one bites the dust."" 

to remember him, i want to bring a speaker and play ""another one bites the dust"" at his wake. i would explain it to the people at the wake and say that i wanted to preserve the person he was. maybe i could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. there will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are catholic, so i've been thinking maybe not. but i really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. i think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

wibta?

edit: i didn't really expect this response, but thank you. my brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. i swear, i almost sense his hand in it. i don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

this morning, i talked to my dad about the wake. i suggested, as some of you did, that maybe i could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. i found a violin one that i really liked. my dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and i made. he actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. i hadn't really been thinking about my dad as much as i should have, i thought of him as opposition, i guess he cared way less about the catholic stuff than i thought. 

i also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. we are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

"by eating a free gumball..  

i'm 23 years old, and i admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

earlier today i was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. during that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, i thought i would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

i checked four candy dispensers; all empty. one last chance. i opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, i find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. without any thought or inspection, i excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. at the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

so there i am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as i spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. i'm certain i looked ridiculous, and i'm still brushing my teeth.

"for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""?. using a throwaway. some context; i live in ca, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. she's 22, i've known her since she was 4. her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. she's very sheltered by her mother. anyway, i told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. she's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

but then my wife goes, ""and she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

i'm 41, my wife is 42. i was like ""you're kidding, right?""

she wasn't kidding. at first, i was like ""hell no."" but after about a week of talking, i gave in....with one caveat. i told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, i'm going to ask some questions he might not like. she wanted to know what kind of questions, and i gave her some.

1. how did you guys meet and who made the first move? (if the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. what's the end game here? a serious relationship, marriage? have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

i know, i'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

so, fast forward to the visit. niece and old dude show up. i'm cordial. i wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and i invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. just me and him. then i start asking my questions. 

after only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. he told me this is ""none of my business."" i got a little pissed at that. 

i told him he's staying in my home for a week, i can ask him a few questions. and the girl is my niece, i'm not out of bounds here. he told me i was making him ""uncomfortable"". i replied that i'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. i said you can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

well, he left. my wife and niece were upset with me. they said i acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. again, i was told it's none of my business. they have since broken up, which i am glad about. not sure if my actions were the cause.

so am i an asshole for questioning this guy?

edit: some info:

i asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

i would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

when i took the old dude outside for a beer, i neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. we discussed the new star wars movies of all things.

i would love to discuss more with some of you, but i was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. so it goes.

edit 2: some of you here asked what's up with my wife and her sister. her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. they're wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

final edit: some of you wondered if i would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and i wouldn't have a problem. 

talked to my niece this morning. she and i are totally fine. knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. i apologized for my actions regardless.

i just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). i was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

he was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. one of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

he gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

i also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* they both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. they aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. with her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. so now she is paying her way. 

anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

"by having my roomate walk in while i was practicing cowgirl riding.... oof

my roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on sunday night. she usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

a week ago, i ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. i don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. so this was fucking fantastic and i was ecstatic.

my plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so i could sit on it and act like it was my bf. i'm not really experienced in the sex department and i wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so i was going to practice until she got back.

before i get into the main event. i need to explain the layout of this house. when opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that used to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. after leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. however since we got it fixed it's silent.

now on to the main event. i had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so i could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. then i pulled out my new toy and i literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

then i got dressed down to what i would be wearing. it was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath i had my lingerie, i did this so i would be in the head space and so i could i imagine the upcoming day.

at this point i'm on the toy and i had a pretty good groove going and i was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so i grabbed some pillows to support, and then i heard a noise. i fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! i shoo'd him out and continued.

another couple minutes go by and i can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. until i realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. i then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and i felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. i heard the suitcase stop and when it did i hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. i was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

lightbulb!

my shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! i sat myself right back down, turned the tv on rick and morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like i had been watching this the entire night.

she came in and saw me and asked why i was sitting like that and i made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and i was just letting it stretch out. she nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that i was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

we sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. she told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

at this point i'm so sore and by sheer will i'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

the moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. i reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. she does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  i pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


tl;dr: tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

update 1: thanks so much for the lovely gold! it's my first one and it makes me happy! for the record, i am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. i haven't told my bf yet since i'm still a bit embarrassed! but i'm planning on telling him on the day. also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

update 2: since it's being asked alot, the reason i was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. i was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. so there were boxes and all that jazz.

update: i tried keeping up with all the comments... i give lol my pupper has been posted in r/aww",4
"my sister is in some weird cult - mi. no, that is not clickbait and i am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

okay. so my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. she came across a craigslist posting by a woman i'll refer to as aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. i never saw the ad, but i remember my sister telling me about it at the time. she was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. so she began a correspondence with ""aileen"". i did not live with my sister, i'm older by 5 years so i was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

so she ends up going to this place last august, i think, maybe early september. i have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. i was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. that right there was the first time i thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so i didn't push it.

over time, the tone of her emails changed. she would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""aileen"" much. then it gradually became that ""aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""aileen"" made her take drugs. seriously disturbing stuff. i told her she needed to get out of there, that i'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

i didn't know what to do at that point. i thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and i trusted her judgment at the time. it's not like i had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, i didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. yes, i was tentatively concerned, is what i'm trying to say, but i felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

my sister emailed me yesterday and i don't feel like that is the case anymore. something had happened and from what i was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. my sister was forced to participate in this. she seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. i don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

i stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but i couldn't figure anything out. i know my sister took a greyhound to lansing and aileen picked her up from the bus station, so i think this freak show is probably in either eaton, or ingham but as to more specifics, i have no idea. i don't think my sister even knows. i have a hunch they're in, or around mason because aileen made the kids spend the night at seven gables, but other than that i'm coming up empty.

i know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but i really need to know what to do. how do i handle this situation?  

good update: i did what a lot of people suggested with the ip address. i would have never thought of it, i'm not very tech savvy. she is in mason or at least uses that library. i'm going to contact the police there. you guys are rockstars.",2
"almost eating my cousin out in her office. (update at bottom!)

this happened yesterday. i can't wait until it's much further away than that.

so this is a throwaway, i have \*(had) another account where i like to post nudes of myself. that can be your judgement, and why i do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but i do. as a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies i get are from guys. but occasionally i get replies from girls who frequent these subs. my face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. just my... ya know, body.

so i had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. she said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. a lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

she is from a large city on the other side of the country as i am, but conveniently i was traveling there next week (this week). we started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. she worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. this idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. we decided i would carry an envelope and say its for office ""xxx,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. no names needed.

most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared waaay too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. we literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. and lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

so along comes yesterday, the big day. i'm so worked up. she's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. shows me that she is already masturbating. etc. oh lord, etc. i text her and tell her i'm in the building. i get to her office, my heart is racing but i'm beyond excited. i see the receptionist, tell her i need a signature from office ""xxx"" and she points me in the right direction. as i walk up, i see the name on the door. my cousins name. my first cousin, who i have known my whole entire life. my cousin, who i spend every holiday with and am very close with. it can't be, i think.

so i knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. and she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. i just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""heyyyy cousin, i was in town and thought i'd stop by!"" she is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""omg cousin!"" and gets up to hug me. i literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. she tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

i race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. she surely thinks this guy ghosted her, i really don't think she thought it was me. maybe i read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. i'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. i don't know really though. i texted her later and told her i was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. we're supposed to get a drink tonight. i'm petrified and don't know how in god's name i will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  it's hard to reply to all of the comments, so i'll say some stuff here.  she works for a very large company in a very large city.  she told me what floor to go, i honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    i do know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if i wanted.  like i said, it's a big company, and not a shock that i could pop in.

yes she is on reddit but i highly doubt she will see this post.  she told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  headed out for drinks now.  wish me luck guys.  i think i'm going to be honest.  i don't know.

edit 3:  well, first of all, id like to address everyone calling bs on this.  it seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  i agree and would call bs reading this also.   i can't really defend it or prove it (or can i?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, i could give a shit!)

• she doesn't have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• she lives in nyc, it's big.  the buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. it didn't occur to me, i guess i was worked up.

• i come here often, it's not that i didn't call her, but sometimes when i'm here she'll dm or comment on my insta story and say ""hey come by and visit next time""

• in our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  there was no door man or anyone else i needed to get past.  i don't know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• we didn't actually say ""hey cousin"" lol, i'm just censoring our names for the post.

• yes guys post nudes to reddit, i would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• i'm 35, she's 26.

• i deleted my account after freaking out, but i'm sure i'll post again and i'll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

i decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn't fucking focus on anything else.  and as many of you guessed, she knew. she didn't buy the ""i just popped in"".  she figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that i knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  i assured her i didn't, it was really weird.  we slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  we complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  we talked about if we actually did anything, it's a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  and then we had another drink.  and then i licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  i stroked myself while i did it, and after i made her cum she helped me out.  we promised we would never do this again, but i think we'll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.


tl:dr - post nudes on reddit, girl replies with elaborate sexual fantasy, go to act out fantasy and realize girl is my cousin.",4
