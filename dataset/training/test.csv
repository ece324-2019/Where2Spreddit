"for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?. so i'm 17 and i used to be morbidly obese. i was actually morbidly obese until last year when i decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. i'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and i feel really great. i went from 130kg to 70kg and i'm 5ft 9

anyways my sister eats horribly. she is morbidly obese. my parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

anyways i saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. the sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. my mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. it's absolutely insane i think and there was nice coke can to go with it. i told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. i offered her a piece of tofu in which i was having for lunch. tofu is actually delicious. more people should try it.

 she told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that i'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when i was a child(i wish someone did). apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. my mother said i wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

"by deleting reddit's #1 top post of all time. happened just now. sorry for my possible slips as english is not my mothertongue. i mostly only lurk around, but this time i decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

i've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. usually when i get depressed at home i start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because i like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

see, since i'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""accounts"" folder and terminating the ones i don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). the thing is i used to have an imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so i decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since i didn't get it by registering at the service directly. i'll omit the details of all the cyber sex i went through with my keyboard and the browser, but i somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so i pretty much forgot about the whole deal. but little did i know.

later in the day i get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. in addition to that i still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. being the total jackass of an idiot that i am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, i decide to google the #1 top reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on imgur (yeah, the one about the senate, with a total of whole damn 310k updoots). i open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise satan himself. of course imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? it can't be this bugged, right? (i hadn't clicked one by then yet). so i click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this tifu.

i'm sorry. i didn't want to. please, forgive me everyone.
i'll commit sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.

that was few years ago.


it was a familly buisness and they were very mean and  have no patience. i ordered a delivery, it came 1h later and cold. called him out about it . dude got mad, start yelling and refused to take it back. he throwed the change at me and stormed away. i called his father (pizza owner) to complain, and he told me that his kid dont get mad if he wasnt right, and told me to put the pizza in the microwave and hung up. i was mad af.  i decided to wait untill i cool off and think about what to do. so the next morning, i called the pizza from a phonebooth and ordered almost 80$ worth of pizza. i gave them the adress of the appartement next to me wich was empty. i turned off my tv so i can hear him coming. he came more than an hour later and start knocking the door. of course no one responded. he insisted by knocking loudly. so i opened my door, and sees him with a ton  of pizza. i just laughed and closed my door. he automaticaly knew that it was me but couldnt prove it. i could hear him yelling, insulting while leaving the building...
that day was satisfying af. i ordered domino to celebrate.

"my new rules for ""lending"" money.... so, when my husband and i first started trying to take our finances seriously, we noticed a particular big leak in our finances.  lending friends and family money.  my husband and i have a lot of friends who have... for lack of a more gracious term... never gotten their shit together.  since we have been making decent money for years, they started getting into the habit of calling us when they got in a financial bind.  $100 here, $20 there, $1000 there.  i realized that we very rarely ever saw any of it back.  i needed to put a stop to this, but i still wanted to be able to help my loved ones when needed.

so i came up with some rules when lending money to loved ones.

1) i never loan money.  if i can't afford to just give it to you, then i can't afford to loan it to you.  it is a gift, and i never expect to see it back.  whether you give it back is completely up to you, and we're still just as good of friends if you don't.  i will never let money come between us.

2) you only get one gift.  if you give it back, then it is no longer a gift, and you are welcome to another gift should you ever need it.  there is no limit to how many gifts you can receive and return, but only one at a time.

3) no, you cannot receive a gift, and then a day/week/month later decide you need to ""add on"" to that gift.  ask for everything you expect to need and then even a little more if you like, but no adding on more later.

4) no means no.  if you try to guilt me or otherwise manipulate me if i refuse to give you money, i will walk away, and we will not be friends or speak again until you understand that you just made me feel used and only valuable to you as a wallet.  i will only forgive this once.  more than once is a pattern that speaks volumes about what i am to you.

so far, this has gone well.  both good friends we have given money to under these rules chose to pay us back over time, and have not requested a second gift yet.  i think being able to repay us on completely their own time, of their own volition, and without any pressure from us made them feel more comfortable and respected.  we've lost some friends over money before we established these rules.  i'm really hoping that this might help plug the financial drain, and preserve friendships at the same time.

if you have any suggestions that could improve this, please feel free to post them. :) 

update: wow. well, i did not expect this to blow up like it has, but that's really cool and i appreciate all the activity, compliments, discussion, and the gold from two lovely people. :) i'm trying to answer any questions directed at me, but on mobile this is a lot to shift through, so feel free to tag me or whatever if you want me to answer or comment on something. thanks everyone for an awesome discussion :)",11
"twice by grabbing a new coworkers boob and then forgetting her husband died.    happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. on wednesday's our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it's a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. it is normal to carpool all together and naturally i drive my two friend-coworkers each time. however this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we'll call her sarah (changed). she's quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. while everyone is leaving the office for lunch i offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. now here's where the first fuck up happens.
   while on the way to the restaurant sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. traffic comes to a halt and i slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. i check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing i am currently full on honkin sarah's right knocker my words start to trail off. ""damn i hope everyone is oka....."" that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that i was just reacting to the situation. for the next few minutes the car was silent until sarah said ""that's funny i haven't had that much action in a while"" which eased the mood and the car all laughed. and fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying ""ahh well we all have our dry spells."" something i thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. she goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. 
   we get to lunch and everything seems okay but sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so i ask what's up. she told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. i instantly apologized saying i had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that i was sorry. she said she didn't care about that and that it was fine it's just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. my heart sunk. i had completely forgotten about her husband. i felt so bad i instantly started apologizing for everything in the world i felt horrible. my friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. i feel so horrible that i have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. please reddit help me feel a little better.

tldr: i yanked a widows titty

"update gf and i (26m/f) got into a huge fight over a keyboard. previous post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)

short edit at bottom.
&nbsp; 

we met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. i was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so i suggested we meet at her place, so that i could bail if things went south...and they did.

&nbsp; 

even though i thought i made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my gfs coworkers figured out who the post was about (gf's age, working hr which i mentioned in a comment, same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my gf. the reason she wanted to meet early was because she was furious that i had made the post, 'airing our dirty laundry.' in a sense, i guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. my gf never used reddit so i figured i was safe.
there's a strong chance she'll read this one as well, lol.

&nbsp; 


anyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that i made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. i asked her to point out any part of it that wasn't true, or where i had lied. long story short, she couldn't point to a single thing. i definitely raised my voice when i told her that if she looked bad, it's only because of her actions. i told her i only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. the post was 100% accurate and she knew it. 

&nbsp; 

she began to tear up and asked me if i really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. i asked her if she understood that this wasn't about the keyboard. it was about the way she acted towards me when i was trying to do her a favor. she stayed silent and didn't answer. i asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was ok with her. i asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.

&nbsp; 

she got really defensive, asking ""are you calling me crazy?"" and ""do you think i'm unstable?"" i had no idea where she was going with this. i told her i wasn't calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that i was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it. 

&nbsp; 

we talked in circles for a bit, and i tried to pry it out of her. i still don't know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn't tell me. when i realized our conversation was going nowhere, i finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. she asked, ""what do you want from me?"" and i said, ""i want an apology.""

&nbsp; 

i'm getting tired of typing so i'll wrap this up quickly. she was absolutely unwilling to apologize. she thought that my ""betrayal"" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. we talked for about 5 more minutes before i told her that i don't even care anymore. i told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn't willing to help us get to the bottom if this. that we should just break up. i didn't waste any time making my way to the door.

&nbsp; 

as i was leaving, she asked if i wanted the keyboard back. she didn't ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. i could tell by her tone of voice. i told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.

&nbsp; 

i've been getting tons of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my fb). she obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like i really did leave her over the keyboard. i couldn't care less, as i'll never be seeing any of them again.

&nbsp; 

we only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, i don't feel terribly heartbroken. mostly just relief that it's over. but...also confusion. still have no idea why she acted out.

&nbsp; 

tl;dr: she wouldn't apologize or tell me what was wrong. after an exhausting conversation, i decided to end it.

&nbsp; 

**and to the people who had some unkind words towards me because i use a razer keyboard: pound sand, dorks. i like what i like.**

very short edit: she called earlier today and was very apologetic. my assumption is that she saw this post and read all the comments detailing how i was right for leaving her, among other things. i told her that she had her chance to apologize.",7
"got a friend or family in the hospital? consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/ereader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.. note: *this is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

i was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. this made me realize what i would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- hospital hvacs systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. i was told they could only bump it up or down here at my va hospital. also, this was the first time i received an iv treatment and let me tell you they are cold... had an iv in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and i am pretty convinced i could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**warm, comfortable socks**- reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *credit*: /u/getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so i followed up and asked my nurse about this.  turns out, the va hospital does have socks available and my new rn was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


**condiments** - i believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. this problem might be compounded by medication. may have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **edit** i recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  generally, it would be wiser to consult with the rn or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**open toe slippers**- luckily i had flip flops on when i was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if i only had tennis shoes. probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**long, braided phone charger** - my wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. i can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. i recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. also, i am using a 5ft usb hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**entertainment**: a book, ereader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   the tv service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. if they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. the gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *edit* /u/stjerndale recommended audiobooks.  great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**gift cards**: *credit: /u/1900grs, /u/halftimeheaters.*  gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*bonus lpt*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  they take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  this bonus lpt is intended for *adult patients.*


edit 1

**power bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  this was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


edit 2

**eye mask & ear plugs** - /u/ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/suedeveil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**moisturizers & chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/fatjennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  i will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing.",9
"by inhaling my tongue ring, ending up pregnant and almost dead.. this is still occurring but it started last week and that day started normal like always, i went to work and when i went to lunch it turned to the worst week of my life.  i was sent on lunch and while i was eating my tongue ring somehow came off and instead of what i initially thought was me swallowing it, the xrays at the hospital showed it was inhaled and went into my lung.   since they had to do an x-ray and a cat scan, i was asked if i was pregnant, i told them absolutely not.  since i have the paraguard iud implanted(birth control).  they did blood work and then came to speak to me and told me that i was in-fact pregnant!  i was absolutely shocked and scared, i called my husband and my mom and told them the news, my husband rushed to the hospital and when he got here he asked if i told them about the iud which i had not yet.  when he told them they said after they performed the  bronchoscopy, they would have to immediately remove the iud. the procedure was really simple and they removed the tongue ring in 30 minutes and i was fine for the most part other than a sore throat.  they came and spoke to me about the pregnancy and the problems the iud can present to it, they immediately removed the iud and told me that it was bent and slipped down which is the reason it didn't work properly after me having it for more than a year.  they also scheduled a ultrasound, when they went in for the ultrasound they couldn't find the pregnancy which raised some concerns, ultimately after two days of waiting in the icu they confirmed it was an ectopic pregnancy, they said the pregnancy was very early so they sent me home with a shot to kill the pregnancy and i was to follow up every two days at a clinic to make sure the pregnancy was being successfully terminated.  everything was alright and even though i had cramps and all other sorts of side effects as long as they weren't too sever i would be fine.  i was feeling completely better saturday morning, but after a shower i suddenly felt a sharp pain on my shoulder and then sever abdominal pain that left me incapacitated, i've never felt such severe pain, after speaking to the clinic through the phone they told me to immediately head to the er, when i arrived they performed an ultrasound which almost made me pass out from the pain and they confirmed my pregnancy burst inside my ovary and i was bleeding internally, so i'm now back home but after the worst weekend of my life i'm left out of work for at least 6 weeks and struggling to get out of bed.  they said if i had not come in i would be dead. luckily the doctors were able to save my ovary.  

tl:dr   inhaled my tongue ring, got diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, the pregnancy burst in my ovary and almost killed me.",4
"instagram is ruining everything (a rant). i think that instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. let me explain:

1. **ig is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. while social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. no political or important dialogue is happening. i would argue that even pinterest is more worthwile since at least diys teach you something.
2. **ig is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** why we are all pretty much aware from our own instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **ig is bad for your mental health.** because unrealistic standards are set on instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in ig. this also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (see also this article: http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/(http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). i also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **ig makes people vain.** taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. it's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. this makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **ig gives the worst incentives to people.** the reason i am ranting right now is that i saw a vice video about a poppy field in california that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for instagram (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka)). they then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". so these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. this shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. now i don't think that they are inherently bad people but i think that instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

i would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. so just to clarify, i do think that one can use instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. what i wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. and while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives i feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. i do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. however, i feel that while some good instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",6
"i own a long-standing, extremely professional massage therapy center in ny and this morning a pretty big radio station said we were an illegitimate spa who gives happy endings. besides asking for a retraction, is there anything else that can be done?. this happened a few days ago. feels like a retraction means nothing nowadays and i've already received calls from people confused and upset, even a few asking if we are going out of business. we are on the opposite side of the spectrum when it comes to being compared to spa's like this; we literally help countless people (many with cancer) through medical massage and other services and of course everyone is licensed and insured. i've already spoken to the station and they were very apologetic and said they'd do a retraction, but i'm still quite angry.

"acne can actually make a person more attractive.. i have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive. however, in my experience, for certain people it honestly kinda of fits well. have you ever met a person who you couldn't imagine without glasses? i'm convinced for certain people its the same with acne. to clarify, i am not talking about severe cystic acne. painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it. but people who have some minor scarring/breakouts it can really add to the character of their faces. this kind of laid back, natural, hippie kinda look. i can't really put my finger on it. it would be almost boring if you saw them with immaculate skin. and even though its already a golden rule, if they have confidence with their skin its even a bigger bonus.

edit: 

well this has never happened before. it's been kind of hilarious to read these comments going from: ""you're an absolutely disgusting vile human being"" to ""i 100% agree with you"". i'm also surprised at how unpopular this opinion really is! but i guess i put it in the right place lol. i'm not sure people should be thanking me either. i can be quite shallow as well. this is just one those subjective quirks i really enjoy and thought needed to be pointed out. but really if you read the comments some of the things you guys are into is pretty unconventional. beyond all these superficial traits though, i think the biggest thing to remember is that sometimes love just happens to you. you don't get to choose it. so stop worrying about who you're gonna pick. and as a the great redditor u/chief_economist once said: sit down, be humble. or was that kendrick lamar? anyway.",6

"once my tax refund comes in, i will have $10,000 saved for the first time in my life. how should i invest and continue to save?. title says most of it. but i'm a single mom, live with my parents until i get on my feet.  my baby is just now old enough for me to go back to work. i'm just waiting on my boss to tell me where she needs me.

"i (29m) just spent another awkward holiday with my girlfriend's (28f) rich family. my girlfriend and i have been together almost 3 years. 99% of the time, we're great. she's funny and smart and we have a lot of shared interests. but every time we visit her family i start doubting everything. 

they are very wealthy, which by itself is not a bad thing, but they're also very fixated on being rich and have a habit of placing the monetary value of things (and people) over everything else. i come from a very middle class background. i have a good education and a decent career that i really enjoy, but i'm definitely not rich. because of this, they view me as a loser.

for example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish honda. when we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. she was furious we didn't bring gf's land rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. gf doesn't like to drive on long trips and i'm not allowed to drive the land rover (per her parents) so we brought my honda. 

gf's dad has never spoken to me directly. even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""what does he do?"" so we went in the house and i gave her dad the usual, ""hi, merry christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

one more example: last year i made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. it was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and i even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. gf's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to gf they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

we managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which i'd normally consider a win. but today i keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if i'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. gf and i have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but i know they'll never accept me. if we get married i'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. gf has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but i can tell it bothers her too. they bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and i think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

so, not to sounds like an asshole, but am i wasting my time? is this relationship doomed? gf always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but i'm not sure that's true. she always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. but i know i'll never be good enough for them, even if i'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: my girlfriend's rich parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.",7

i had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but i still swiped out of boredom. they were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. only boob. there was no picture of her husband. i take a few shots and message them.  after like an hour of talking, i decide to just do it. we never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. she wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. at first i was like really not for it, i originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and i was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. at 2am i left the house, and this is where i regret everything.

&#x200b;

after driving for about an hour, i miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped two of my tires. i'm in a shitty ghetto town that i've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how i'm getting home now. i thought i was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. but since there was no turning back now, i decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

the husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as i see him, my gut and inner voice are screaming at me, don't do this, turn back. and i wish i had listened. for reasons unknown, i followed him into the house. it was pitch black, not a single light was on. he lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. i was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. if there was ever a time i disassociated, it was then and there. it was no longer me behind the wheel. the dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. does anybody remember the scene in blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? that was what i saw. a disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. i was horrified but at the same time, i didn't care. they both fucking stink, that was one of the worst things. the smell took forever to wash off my hands after. months later i'll get a whiff out of nowhere. that disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

i take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking the entire time, like fucking gollum. saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. look at that beautiful pussy. ain't she so fuckin wet?"" nonstop. meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. like i said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, i managed to perform to a degree but i never did finish. it probably didn't help i was wearing a condom but i'm extremely glad i was. the entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""how the fuck am i getting home? this smell is going to kill me. how do i end this? how do i get out of here?""

i decided it was time, i had to get the fuck out of there asap. i told them i couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. they insisted i put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. i just wanted to make it look like i at least tried. if the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. i pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. i stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. i politely reiterated i wasn't going to be able to finish. i blamed it on my tires being popped and i was too tired. they were cool about it, and i quickly gathered my things and left.

i barely had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. so we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. my hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers i took and how many times i washed them. i blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what i did. it took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200b;

tldr; drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

"for years i paid interest on maxed out ccs. after paying them off, i challenged myself to make the money back from the banks. this year i earned $2000 worth of cc rewards while raising my credit score from 590 to 715.. i understand cc rewards and credit scores are not the cornerstones of personal finance. but this one is personal: 

as a freshman in college, i found out my parents took out credit cards in my name and maxed them out. it was a shit show. however, while they did something terrible i understand their reasons (survival -- they were hopeless). this left me with $3,000 dollars of credit card debt. during undergrad and grad school, i could never pay these off and kept sending $50 to the banks each month just to keep them from going delinquent. sometimes, i missed payments.

in another post, i explained how after grad school i was able to pay off all my debt and raise my score from 590 to 705 in half a year(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/54qsmw/this_summer_i_paid_off_all_my_cc_debt_raised_my/). hallelujah! 

so i started doing what i always wanted to do: use credit cards responsibly. moreover, **i was on a mission to earn the money back that i had to pay in interest all those years.** i closed most of my old cards as they also had annual fees and no perks but kept my discover card. i was able to upgrade it to discover it immediately and start earning a percentage back. i was surprised only a couple months later when i got a pre-selected letter for the citi double cash back card. i signed on. i also became an avid fan of nerdwallet(https://www.nerdwallet.com) reviews and other blogs about the best rewards cards and how to use them wisely.

here's the breakdown of my crusade:
-----------

discover it(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/discover-it) ------------------------- $147 -- % back.

chase freedom(https://thepointsguy.com/2016/04/chase-sapphire-freedom-unlimited-power-duo/)	--------------------$313 -- worth in points. signup bonus + % back.

chase saphire prefered(https://thepointsguy.com/2016/04/chase-sapphire-freedom-unlimited-power-duo/) ------------$600 -- worth in points. signup bonus + % back.

citi double cash(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/citibank-double-cash-card) --------------------$350 -- 2% back on everything. this is my catch-all card.

hilton honors(https://www.valuepenguin.com/hilton-hhonors-credit-card) -----------------------$400 -- value of 80k points(https://thepointsguy.com/2017/06/june-2017-monthly-valuations/). signup bonus.

bank of amer cash rewards(https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/bank-of-america-bankamericard-cash-rewards-visa-signature) ------ $150 -- signup bonus after spending $500. 

amazon store card ------------------$40 -- signup bonus. i wanted to pre-order destiny 2, sue me. 

chase banking account -------------$200 -- this wasn't a cc but i got $200 for moving to a chase account. 

-------------

so that's where i stand right now. it's important to note that i always pay my credit cards in full each month. and while i know my credit score could be higher if i was letting my average credit history grow, i'm happy with it in the 700s at the moment. i imagine soon i'll end this crusade and cancel the sign-up bonus cards. at that time, i'll cozy up to my double cash card and spend a life together.

-------------

**edit**

1. i've gotten some messages that i'm likely just letting my spending creep up to meet these goals. this is *absolutely* something people should try to avoid. personally, i track my monthly spending for each category and set goals of what i want to spend in each per month before looking for ccs. this helps me avoid spending more just to make a reward bonus.

2. bank bonuses! i forgot to mention i switched to a new bank for a $200 credit. haven't spent a dime there either, just needed to set up a direct deposit with chase.

**tl;dr** i spent years in cc debt due to my parent's fuck up. i paid them all off finally a year ago and have comitted to being a wise cc user. without increasing my spending, i started taking advantage of every cc signup bonus, cc % back, or checking account signup bonuses i could to get that money back.

"for those in flooded areas, use extreme caution when walking on streets and sidewalks. manhole covers are often forced off by the flood and can be extremely dangerous as people can fall in, get trapped, and drown.. i'm from new orleans where flooding is common. rising water in sewers offen moves manhole covers(openings to the sewer) creating a very dangerous situation especially when water is being pumped through the sewers (as in during a flood). it creates underground rivers and people fall in and drown.

"psa: it's that time of year again. if ""the irs"" calls you demanding money, it's not the irs.. here is a partial list from the irs of known, common scams:

https://www.irs.gov/uac/tax-scams-consumer-alerts

>note that the irs will never: 1) call to demand immediate payment, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed you a bill; 2) demand that you pay taxes without giving you the opportunity to question or appeal the amount they say you owe; 3) require you to use a specific payment method for your taxes, such as a prepaid debit card; 4) ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone; or 5) threaten to bring in local police or other law-enforcement groups to have you arrested for not paying.

the irs also offers these tips(https://www.irs.gov/uac/irs-urges-public-to-stay-alert-for-scam-phone-calls) on how to recognize, avoid, and report tax scammers.

##if you get called by a scammer, consider collecting their stated name, phone number they are calling from, and number you are directed to call and reporting it to tigta(https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml) and/or the federal trade commission(https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/gettingstarted?nextqid=216&selected=t%20-%20crnt#crnt) (with ""irs telephone scam"" in the notes).  do not give out any personal information.

i highly recommend that those of us with elderly parents or family members share the word.  the elderly are some of the most vulnerable when it comes to online or telephone scams.

as a humorous anecdote, last night i received a call from an attempted phone scammer.  blah blah blah a recent judgment in a tax court means i owe $8,152.91 in back taxes that was due last year.  as a favor to me, they were willing to settle for $6,000.  what a bargain.",11
"for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?. my former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. as a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so i was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. she (now laura) has not started hrt yet but is living fulltime as a woman. laura and i no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

ever since i moved out and laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. she's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

i am fine with what laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

i tried to talk about this privately to laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. my son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. the moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. people were obviously listening and when i gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because i was jealous of her confidence. to make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that i was a piece of shit for saying what i was. my son and i left in tears but laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

ever since then i've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and i was a bad person for asking laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. i'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if i've gotten old and out of touch. it just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this. for speaking to my ex this way?",3

i called her, she accepted my call and said ""what?"" i told her ""i'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

i texted her, ""i need the copy of my house keys back, i'm breaking up with you.""

she didn't respond. i got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

i looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. so i texted her ""where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

i drove back home and i noticed her car parked next to my house, i carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there i see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my ipad...) that's when i tell her ""what are you doing?"" 

she tells me, ""i'm taking back what's mine."" that's when i tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""get off me."" she started kicking me and ran out the house.

i tell her to give my shit back or i will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so i whip out my phone and dial the cops.

she drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my ipad.

"i learned something about my mom's past, and i feel like i've stolen something from her.. for context, i'm a 25yo woman.

last month, i was at my parent's house. i was helping my mom with something when i noticed a piece of paper barely sticking out of a folder. all i could see was a title that ended with the phrase ""as rape survivor"" and something that looked like my sister's name next to the right margin on the second line.

yes, i know, i shouldn't have read it. but i dare you not to do the same in my position.

there was a split second where i considered pretending i'd never seen it. but selfishly, i thought i \*had\* to know.

and naively, i thought that whatever i could imagine could be worse than what had happened.

after all, my mother was and is a popular likable extrovert who drank like a fish in college and always had a date to dances. and well, norms have changed. there are experiences that might seem like rape in hindsight that would not have been considered so at the time.

i was expecting a story involving fuzzy boundaries and fuzzy memories, the edges worn down by the decades passed since. it wasn't that i wanted to invalidate her experience precisely, but mentally minimize it so that i could neatly consign it to the same place where i keep stories about her grad school roommates.

until i started reading.

it was the kind of rape that people often imagine when they talk about rape. behind her apartment. by two strangers. at gunpoint. on her 24th birthday. my mother, the woman who believes that people are fundamentally good. my mother, the most empathetic and emotionally intelligent person i've ever met. my mother, the woman who leaves our front door unlocked at least 80% of the time. she was raped at gunpoint when she was six months younger than i am now.

she talked about how it tested her support network - how her new boyfriend dumped her and how people—female and male alike—asked what she was wearing. how men who had been casually interested in her suddenly treated her like she was infected.

the whole essay made me feel nauseous.

true to form, her essay framed the aftermath reactions as a valuable relationship litmus test. she severed ties with some friends and drew closer to others.

i can't help feeling like i failed the litmus test.

by picking up that paper and by making assumptions before i'd even started reading. i betrayed her and stole something that belonged to her.",13
"i got hired!! it's been a rough jobless year.. only 50$ bucks left in my account. thank god. okay so i still can't believe i got this job! it feels so unreal! 

so i have been job searching since last august, and the last four months of the search i basically lost all motivation and felt like there was no where to go. luckily, i still pushed through it. 

i was actually hired a week prior for min.wage position that offered no benefits and just bad. the day before i started that position i got an email for a phone interview. i squeezed it in before heading to my first day of work. a couple hours later they wanted to set up an interview for the next day. i quickly went to the manager and asked if i could leave early tomorrow since i had a prior appointment ( i felt bad but i figure it was a good excuse because they hired me on the spot with no notice on the start date) but they said no. i went home and realized that i really wanted this job, so i took the risk of resigning after one day of work. the next day i was about to head out for the interview but i got an email saying they needed to reschedule. my heart dropped and the rush of regret of quitting set in. my mind started racing and i started to realize that i probably won't get this job. i quickly rushed back on indeed and starting sending out my resumes yet again. luckily, we ended up rescheduling for the next day. i went and the interview went food, but i knew i messed up a couple times. when i got home my anxiety was to the roof because now i had to play the waiting game. the next day i felt so bad and constantly checked my email. i was prepared to get a rejection letter or to be ghosted. then around 11 am i got an offer email!! i couldn't believe my eyeballs lol. 

the location is great, the pay is over 45% more then what i was getting, i get to wear jeans, and i get benefits!! 

i'm so glad i took that risk and can't believe i got such a good paying job with a political science major. 

i can't wait to buy a new outfit and buy a beer with my first paycheck. it's been way too long since i had a meal other then ramen and eggs. i'm so relieved that i can pay of my student loads and start trying to bring my credit up.


edit- 

i want to really thank everyone for congratulating me! i feel extremely excited and motivated by everyone's good words and i am so happy to be able to share this with people since i really didn't have anyone to tell! 

i am also glad this motivated people who are also still searching for a job. don't give up, and don't sell yourself short!

"another lesson in ""do not sign till you sleep on it."". my 2001 subaru forester that i love dearly just had the clutch replaced last month. driving home from the mall on sunday, i was passing a big new and used car lot and i heard ""pop!"" from my motor and lost all power. i coasted the subaru into a parking spot at the car lot, and called the partner to come get me. 

while i'm waiting, i was approached by a salesman who reminded me that a 2001 car is 16 years old. he showed me a kia that was similar in shape and size to my subaru. the price on the windshield was just over $10,000. 

the husband showed up, diagnosed the subaru as a busted timing belt, and got into the conversation with the salesman on the kia. i hemmed and hawed, we did the math, yes i could afford it, but going $10,000 in debt was not what i had planned for a sunday afternoon. my down payment was going to have to wait for my bank to open on monday anyway. i got the guy's card, took pics of the vin # on the kia, and headed to the husband's car.

at the last minute, the credit manager runs out the door and puts a piece of paper in front of me. he says ""60 months at $178 and you drive away in this kia tonight."" i said ""why would i sign something without having slept on it? i'll be back tomorrow with my down payment."" 

i went home and did the math on his offer and discovered that he didn't calculate my down payment. i was not happy about the offer at all. i read some low reviews on that make and model of kia. then i read some shitty history on the vin search about that particular car. still, however, i had no car to drive, and i need to commute from the 'burbs to the city every day.

the next morning, before the bank opened, i called my mechanic and asked him ""what do you think about this model kia?"" his response was ""what happened to your subaru?"" i told him that my partner diagnosed the timing belt issue. he said ""that's a $500 fix. the valves don't get bent on that motor. tow it over here."" for another $200 he's going to replace the windshield that picked up a crack recently. plus the tow bill, the whole thing is less than $800. less than the down-payment i was going to pull out of savings. 

so now have my old subaru back, i'm not $10,000 in debt, i don't need full coverage insurance because there's no loan on it, and someone else can buy that pos kia. dodged that bullet.

don't ever sign anything that big without sleeping on it. 

edit: i will trust my mechanic long before i will trust a stranger's advice on the internet, so you can stop telling me how stupid or wrong he is. 
edit 2: i also admit that i left some info out of this post, such as my history in the auto insurance industry, which means i know cars and i know insurance. 
edit 3: the point is not that i kept the subaru; the point is that i did not buy the kia. read for comprehension, not for response. ",11

"watching incest porn. *throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

this happened yesterday. i was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. i will state, for the record, i do not advocate incest. my girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. all i wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so i went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. that's all this was. research. 

so, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. of all people. if there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment i look straight into it. i answered the phone. the old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

cut to my dad and i driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. then, there came the silence. it wasn't the awkward kind. but i guess we just kinda said enough at the time. my father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. he was in the mood to get jiggy with jeezy. but instead of hearing voices worshipping the og upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital q&a: 

*""you like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

my old man unknowingly activated the car's bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever i was listening to last. in this case, it was fucking incest porn. now, i never closed the video before i left the house, but i did pause the motherfucker. yet, somehow, my phone went skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

i frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what i do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

dad: suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids.

i immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home.

"for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after i got rich?. my mom left my dad when i was 17 (i'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. we all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. she had 2 more kids with this guy. 

when my mom and dad broke up i moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. the major reason for this was because she told me to leave as i kept fighting with her new dude. i really did not want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and i was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. when she told me to leave...something in me changed and i am still unable to forgive her. that solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. and my sister and mom were close so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

since i was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc i like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. they gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, i majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. the profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, i'm living a life i never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

i moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. i am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and i'm grateful so much bc i was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

for the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. she is getting increasingly more insistent that i go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. she keeps telling me that 'even if i don't forgive her i should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

because day to day i have no interest in helping her or her family? imo she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. i just can't forgive her though.",3

"by causing an explosion 40,000ft above the atlantic ocean on an international flight.. i was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from delhi to london, so i quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as i ran to the boarding gate.

about 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the tvs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

i can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. it didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. the people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

after a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. my travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

as it turns out, in india they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. they're also dirt cheap, so i bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks i'd grabbed in a rush earlier). the pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

and **that** is how i accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.

"by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp. technically yesterday and not today, but yifu sounds like some odd anime genre so...

so it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. i was dropping her off at about 8ish and i was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. for the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

anyway, stopped at the summer camp. my daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. i signed my daughter in and then i.... just drove off. in my defense, well, i got nothing. honestly, i just forgot the dog there.

so my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. i now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). she also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. she got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. all in all, could have gone worse.

edit - i get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  sorry, but no can do.  pics include other people's kids and i'm not going to post that.  also, i think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and i've said way too much shit i regret on reddit for that to happen.  just use your imaginations.  she's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  she's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

edit 2 - for those asking.  yes, camp called me.  twice.  and left vm's both times.  number was not one i recognized so i didn't pick up or check vm (i know, tifu!  number is now programmed in).  both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if i could come pick the dog up.  i clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  and yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  huge huge props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

edit 3 - for those asking.  i did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  so i left them an awesome review on yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

edit 4 - yah, i get it.  this could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  yes, it was a mistake on my side.  that's why i'm posting it here and not on r/todayiwasawesome

"by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner. happened about a week ago, but i've been hesitant to post this as i wasn't sure if it really fits. no one involved in this story is a minor. tl;dr at bottom.

i am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. there are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. we were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iphone. she was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""what?"" the collective asked.

""there's some dude's dick here!""

we gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). we laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. we looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. we also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. we couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

before i turned the setting off, everyone using my family icloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos i saved to my phone. this got annoying after my mom started questioning things i had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so i turned it off.

without thinking of the consequences, i asked her if she shared an icloud account with anyone. she said she shared one with her parents. she got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

i've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. the rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. we sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

the image is burned into all of our minds. i've never met her father but i'm terrified one day i will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and i'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

tl;dr: friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, i can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through icloud, and now none of us are okay.

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

i started searching for cars online. i can get this 2016 for just $18,000! but i might as well go new for a lower interest rate. that's only $25,000 for a brand new car. i have about $2,000 budgeted for car repairs that i can add to trade-in value on my accord and will come away with a super nice vehicle at a low monthly rate.


as i continued searching, i kept trying to fight reality. in actuality, i have the ability to fix every one of these issues, but my own laziness is tempting me to find the easy way out.


i got online and found new brake rotors and pads, air and oil filters, and spark plugs. i got my oil from a local mega-chain. in one day i plugged a tire (nail), changed my air filter, changed out the brakes, changed my oil, and changed my plugs. in total it may have cost me a hundred bucks and a weekend day. i also cleaned up all the trash and clothes, and vacuumed the car. i felt so accomplished when i was finished.


i swear, it feels like i'm driving a whole new car. now looking back, it seems silly that i wanted to buy a new car just for convenience of not having to deal with preventative maintenance. before you make a large purchase, take a step back and ask yourself if it's really necessary. i consider myself great with money but apparently very lazy as well haha.



edit: many posters have recommended other semi-diy preventative maintenance jobs for older cars. do these at your own risk. there should be plenty of instructional videos on youtube. (in no particular order):


replace water pump

replace control arm bushing

replace tie rod end

flush brake fluid

change transmission fluid

replace serpentine belt

clean mass airflow/map sensor

clean throttle body

replace fuel filter

replace shocks/struts",11

"i used to throw out food so my mom had to cook again. when i was a kid i used to live alone with my mother, she always cooked more than necessary at lunch so she don't need to cook again for dinner. food usually was enough even for the next day lunch. i hated this, in my mind, there was no need for that. she was just lazy. i threw out the food so she had to cook a new one, this last for a month or so, obviously she realized what i was doing but never said a word, she just took the ""hint"" and cooked less.looking back, she was so fucking busy. single mother having to take care of a child and work at the same time. honestly, this is not something i cared that much until last week when she died, everything came back. all the shit i've done in the past that made our life difficult.",13

"for telling my new neighbours that i've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends?. i've been away since thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently sunday afternoon where i live.  here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that monday to friday, which means i had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. 

my 30 something year old neighbours moved in on friday when i wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when i was collecting my mail. she goes ""don't check your mailbox on weekends. they don't deliver on weekends. so don't check it."" (in a rude karen voice, if you know then you know.) already, i know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and i'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so i said ""i know, it's just i've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so i had to check the mailbox."" i don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

she seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. then we both went inside and that was that. about 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking i was held captive in my basement which i don't have, so i explained to them what i had said and they just laughed and left.

just before, i was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think i was kidnapped

thanks everyone for your support. i actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. i didn't know she'd be there. she said hi to me like nothing was the matter. like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. she looked great and i wish i hadn't gone to the party. i was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. but seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

after the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. she said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when i was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. just like that. she said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). she said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

i said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. she apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. she said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

i just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. so she just decided pretending i didn't exist was the best way to do it. 

i can't say hearing all this helps. i don't really even have much closure. but people wanted me to update and so i did.

thanks for all your help guys. wish it was more interesting than it really was.",7

i moved away from home to be with him and i don't know anyone here. all of my outings have been with my husband. this weekend, a friend of mine is visiting and i told my husband i would love to have some time off so that i can meet up with her. he flat out said no and that he refuses to use his weekend to take care of the kids and the house. his reasoning is that he works hard all week and expects me to stay home or take the kids with me. am i wrong to be upset over his reaction?

"i kept a detailed record of how much was spent to have our baby. here it is.. almost three years ago my wife and i had our first kid. i kept track of everything that we spent money on that was kid related. starting from the pregnancy test to the hospital delivery bill. we also estimated the value of any gift we received to give a full ~~itemized bill~~ idea of how much money was spent on our kid before she was even born. i made an ugly spreadsheet to track it all. i thought about posting this here when i was all done but decided not to because a, i just had a kid and was busy, and 2 i wasn't ready for the criticism i was inevitably going to receive. but, now i am ready and less busy, so here we go. 

starting with the big number:  
to bring our baby into the world from scratch cost $9,984.55.  
my wife and i spent $6445.66.  
we estimated receiving $3,538.89 in gifts.  

i broke everything down into these categories:

category |cost
---|---
gear | $1,661.02
diapers ect. | $119.90
baby clothes | $294.54
mom clothes | $804.30
medical | $4,170.05
books | $248.78
toys | $275.93
bedroom | $2,305.53
feeding | $161.21

in anticipation of some shock on all this spending i'll add that we bought things that we felt would be useful to our lifestyle, within our budget, and that would last for many years to come. we could have spent less, and many people do, and many people actually go well beyond.

**the most expensive things were:**  
the hospital trip to safely have a baby ($3517 delivery related bills combined)  
*-having a baby fall out of a woman in a hospital in america is expensive. this was after insurance covered their portion.*  
a crib + mattress that converts to a toddler bed and full size bed ($890 total - gift)  
*-kid is almost 3 and we converted the crib to the toddler bed shortly after she turned 2. she wasn't a chewer, so it's currently in great shape to stay her bed until her teens or beyond.*  
mom clothes ($804.30)  
*-after seeing this final number i told myself i shouldn't ever gain too much weight because i now know how much a new wardrobe could end up costing me. we were at a point in life where most of the items were bought new and that was ok. 
a new glider chair ($500 - gift)  
*-i wish we could have found this used but didn't have any luck. we wanted one with a high back because i'm tall. i'm thankful we found one, i spent so many nights rocking and dozing in and out of sleep on this thing, i'm very happy with it. we still use it nightly for reading bedtime stories.*    
the stroller ($384)  
*-we got one of those fancy bob running strollers, i ran over a hundred miles with her and we walked plenty of unpaved trails at our local state park. she spent hundreds of hours in this thing. this was the only stroller we used, otherwise we carried her everywhere in the front/back carrier. plus these strollers have a high resale value.*  
car seat + extra base ($375)  
*-we have two cars, a base for each car was great.*  
two camera video baby monitor ($250)  
*-we did a lot of traveling and having the extra camera to just pack and go was really handy. a video monitor is the shit, being able to check and see if a noise was just stirring or something more was great.*  
a cute rug ($239)  
*-a cheap rug would have served the same purpose, but shit it's our first kid, sometimes you gotta get that cute thing.*

writing this with the benefit of hind sight i think we actually did a great job of getting the right thing for us on the first try. we tried to get things with the idea of potentially having another child. of everything major that we bought, the monitor is the only thing we would need to replace if another kid sauntered into our lives. the battery is now totally useless and one of the cameras died last month. also we dropped it, so the power cord is soldiered to the chip and i'm awful at soldiering so it whole housing is glued together to keep it working. 

so can you do this cheaper? absolutely, buy everything used. babies aren't all that picky. i lived in rural illinois at the time and our availability to get nice used stuff was limited. also hand-me-downs can help tremendously, our extended family had kids eight years or more years before us (if they had any) and lived many states away so most of their baby stuff was gone. also, don't underestimate the generosity of others, there are people out there who love babies and love buying baby things, hopefully you know one or two.

another money saving tidbit, use cloth diapers. back when i was weighing the benefits of them, i found we would break even with cloth over disposable at two years. our kid suddenly decided to be potty trained right before christmas so our cloth diapers lasted a bit over 2.5 years, we definitely saved money with cloth. if we accidentally have another kid we will save a ton in diapers because the original ones we got are still in great shape. also, you can find used cloth diapers around which can save tons, we hope to sell ours. a very appreciable downside to cloth, you're guaranteed to be washing the diapers about 2-4 times per week.

a shout out to /r/predaddit for all the helpful tips and stories that were so great at the time. also /u/steeldirigible98 & /u/savingsjada and the several updoots for the courage to finally post this on this sub. i hope this info helps someone out there.",11
"for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time?. i was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. at a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

as i was near, i rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

when she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me i'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

i said ok, i just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" i dont need your help"", again super angry. 

i wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but i was the first one, cause i was sitting right by the restroom

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

am i the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

"for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a japanese downpour?. my friends and i went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

we're from england, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in japan. it is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. i warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. they were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

i warned them multiple times that if it rains, i would not let them borrow my umbrella.

one friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. i reminded them that i would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

roughly an hour later, it started raining. hard. it was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. i stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). when we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. neither were particularly happy.

"i sold a plastic bottle cap to a mentally handicapped kid when i was 8.. at the age of 8, i decided i wanted to make money for whatever reason goes through the mind of a kid. 

there was this mentally impaired kid living in my street, who was always very nice to the neighbourhood and waved her hand with a big smile to everyone. she could barely talk intelligibly but could understand simple words.

so one day, going through the mess of my bedroom i found a plastic bottle cap. i walked up to the kid and told her it is a very important object and that her parents really need it. her parents would be really happy to have it. they would be angry if she loses it. 

now, for mentally handicapped kids, their parents, their house, their neighbourhood is the only world they know. it is the limit of their universe, this is all they got. they are innocent. they cannot imagine what being mean or dishonest is. 

i told her she needed to give me coins to get the cap. she came back with a bunch of coins in her hand. she looked so happy. she couldn't count, so i took all of it. 

it has been 20 years now, and i have deep remorses for what i did. taking advantage of an impaired and innocent child who cannot imagine people can be deceiving. i can imagine her cheering that ridiculous cap, like its gold. showing it to her parents because she loves them. 

the kid has passed away because of her disease and i will never be able to repair what i did.

"there's no such thing as a ""1099 employee."" if your employer controls where and how you work and how you get paid, you're probably a w-2 employee and not an independent contractor.. i see quite a few threads on this sub asking about taxes and pay as an ""independent contractor"" or ""1099 employee"" where the op goes on to say they have a set schedule, set work assignments, and get paid at regular intervals. this is not what an independent contractor is, and there's a good chance the worker in question is being misclassified as a contractor when they're in fact an employee.

employers misclassify employees as contractors in order to avoid paying payroll taxes like unemployment insurance premiums and the employer's share of fica (social security and medicare) withholdings. the misclassified workers also don't get the protection of worker's compensation or other employment laws. it's a rampant problem (especially in recent years), and any ""independent contractor"" should take a careful look at their business relationship.

there are laws in most states that distinguish a true contractor from an employee, and the irs has its own set of standards (see https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee(https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee)). in a nutshell, being a contractor or employee comes down to how much control the business paying you has over your work and finances.

* if the business you're working for can tell you when, where, and how to work or has set methods/procedures, you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if your job performance is measured against the business's standards, you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if the business you're working for reimburses your expenses, gives you tools/equipment and materials to do your work, or pays you by the hour, week, month, etc., you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if you only work for one company, provide services to them full-time, and do so continuously (i.e. not project-based work), you're probably not an independent contractor.
* if you can quit or be fired at any time without cause/notice or financial repercussions (i.e. working at-will), you're probably not an independent contractor.

if you think you might actually be an employee based on factors like these, but are getting a 1099-misc instead of a w-2 and are being treated as a ""contractor,"" **please report it** to your state's revenue agency, unemployment agency, and/or labor department. you can also file form ss-8 with the irs, but the irs is very underfunded/understaffed right now, so you may want to reach out to your state's agencies first. your state can probably do an audit and then refer the findings to the irs on its own.

worker misclassification is a huge problem that needs more attention. businesses might save on payroll taxes by passing off employees as ""contractors,"" but the misclassified worker gets all of the tax liability and none of the protections.

tl;dr – employees get misclassified as ""independent contractors"" all the time. know the factors and report it if you think something's amiss.",11

"for telling a stranger to delete a picture of me and my seizure alert dog that he took of me on the bus even after he told me why?. heya. 

so this happened a few days ago, and i'm still pretty worried about whether i'm an asshole or not. 

i take the bus to and from work and it's quite a long commute. background: 

 i have epilepsy. i have a seizure alert dog, and he comes with me on the bus. because hes trained to do all kinds of support tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). 

ive had a lot of seizures on the bus, so i have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day. to accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, i sit in the disability seating section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the way. 

now onto the story: 

i'm on the bus ride home, and i found a seat in the disability section. i was about 2 stops from my home, and  i was starting to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. the next thing i know, i see a flash. 

i look up, and a man sitting near me was holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. i was in a bit of a rough state, so i asked him to delete it. i was probably firmer than i usually would be, but my dog was alerting me and i had about 10-15 mins to get home. 

the man was stuttering and saying things like ""i just wanted a picture he was being so cute and i saw his id badge (he has one attached to his vest that says ""seizure alert dog"")."" i asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes ""my daughter has epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog"" 

i told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that he deleted it. 

i was then at my stop and ran home.

i felt bad, because i do epilepsy activism work so i felt for him but i was really uncomfortable with someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section just felt wrong. 

should i have just let him keep the picture? aita?

edit to clear up some things: 

-i dont care about legality, just the asshole nature of the situation
-i'm a female :) 
-i live in canada
-while i dont have exclusive photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse 
-if he had asked me, i would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. hes super cute so i get it.

so this is a throwaway, i have \*(had) another account where i like to post nudes of myself. that can be your judgement, and why i do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but i do. as a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies i get are from guys. but occasionally i get replies from girls who frequent these subs. my face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. just my... ya know, body.

so i had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. she said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. a lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

she is from a large city on the other side of the country as i am, but conveniently i was traveling there next week (this week). we started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. she worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. this idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. we decided i would carry an envelope and say its for office ""xxx,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. no names needed.

most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared waaay too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. we literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. and lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

so along comes yesterday, the big day. i'm so worked up. she's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. shows me that she is already masturbating. etc. oh lord, etc. i text her and tell her i'm in the building. i get to her office, my heart is racing but i'm beyond excited. i see the receptionist, tell her i need a signature from office ""xxx"" and she points me in the right direction. as i walk up, i see the name on the door. my cousins name. my first cousin, who i have known my whole entire life. my cousin, who i spend every holiday with and am very close with. it can't be, i think.

so i knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. and she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. i just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""heyyyy cousin, i was in town and thought i'd stop by!"" she is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""omg cousin!"" and gets up to hug me. i literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. she tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

i race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. she surely thinks this guy ghosted her, i really don't think she thought it was me. maybe i read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. i'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. i don't know really though. i texted her later and told her i was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. we're supposed to get a drink tonight. i'm petrified and don't know how in god's name i will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  it's hard to reply to all of the comments, so i'll say some stuff here.  she works for a very large company in a very large city.  she told me what floor to go, i honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    i do know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if i wanted.  like i said, it's a big company, and not a shock that i could pop in.

yes she is on reddit but i highly doubt she will see this post.  she told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  headed out for drinks now.  wish me luck guys.  i think i'm going to be honest.  i don't know.

edit 3:  well, first of all, id like to address everyone calling bs on this.  it seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  i agree and would call bs reading this also.   i can't really defend it or prove it (or can i?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, i could give a shit!)

• she doesn't have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• she lives in nyc, it's big.  the buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. it didn't occur to me, i guess i was worked up.

• i come here often, it's not that i didn't call her, but sometimes when i'm here she'll dm or comment on my insta story and say ""hey come by and visit next time""

• in our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  there was no door man or anyone else i needed to get past.  i don't know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• we didn't actually say ""hey cousin"" lol, i'm just censoring our names for the post.

• yes guys post nudes to reddit, i would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• i'm 35, she's 26.

• i deleted my account after freaking out, but i'm sure i'll post again and i'll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

i decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn't fucking focus on anything else.  and as many of you guessed, she knew. she didn't buy the ""i just popped in"".  she figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that i knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  i assured her i didn't, it was really weird.  we slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  we complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  we talked about if we actually did anything, it's a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  and then we had another drink.  and then i licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  i stroked myself while i did it, and after i made her cum she helped me out.  we promised we would never do this again, but i think we'll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.


tl:dr - post nudes on reddit, girl replies with elaborate sexual fantasy, go to act out fantasy and realize girl is my cousin.",4
"my38m wife 24f of 3 years, took my daughter14f to visit her parents in russia. wife doesn't want to come back. like above. sorry for ranting and any grammar errors i've been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. also this is a throwaway so i don't completely dox myself. 

my wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of st. petersburg, russia. 

my wife herself was born there, and came to the us when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (this is not a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). i was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

as she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the us. it just kind of happened that way. (she entered on a f1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we've been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the us with my family and one in russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

until last week she hadn't seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as i have custody. 

as school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it'd be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. she wanted to bring my daughter with her - i initially was opposed to this - but i caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

through her trip she hasn't been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on whatsapp and photos etc. which is understandable - she's on vacation and i don't expect constant alerts, but i would have liked a little more of an update. my daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

yesterday morning i had texted my wife that i'd be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. she read the message but never answered. i told my daughter the same and she never responded. i assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

i had a hellish day at work so i went right to bed so i could be up early to go get them. 
i wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and i look at my phone to message them. i see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn't know how to get home. confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 panicked i reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. she finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn't want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that i took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - i go off on her through text. she tells me off and stops answering me. 

i reach out to her mom through whatsapp (who doesn't speak english at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. her mom said she didn't know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

panicked i go to reach out the us consulate in saint petersburg only to find online it was shut down in march and the nearest is in moscow. i reach out to the moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a huge help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

my wife still hasn't answered me since our blow out. and her mom said she hasn't seen or heard from her since this morning.

what the hell am i supposed to even do with this? the lack of responsibility and carelessness she showed is astronomical to me.",7
"it's been six years since i died.. i don't know how to start this. i wish i could articulate it beautifully and have it be touching, but i'm unsure i'm gifted with that. however, i'll do my best here.  


specifically, seven years ago, my life spiraled down. my best friend since grade school committed suicide, and to cope, i started taking any drug i could find, or get a hold of. over the counter meds, cocaine, meth, heroin, mushrooms, ecstasy, opioids, literally anything i could get my hands on that i could use to drown the pain out for a little while. i'm bipolar ii, and i stopped taking my psychiatric medications in the process of all this and just let it all escalate to hell. as a result, i lost my family's trust for a long time, my boyfriend at the time left me, i was alone. and i wanted it to end. so i knocked back an entire bottle of pills and crawled into bed.  


if it wasn't for my sibling who came to ask me for a cigarette, and found me incoherent, throwing up, and barely conscious, i wouldn't be here. they had to restart my heart. took three times, but i'm here today.  


i'm here today and i'm six years sober, even off marijuana (it's legal for recreational use in my state). i have a fiance, i'm in nursing school, i have a three year old (turning four this month) daughter. i have a happy life. i'm content. you really do have to get worse to get better.  


i still struggle with suicidal thoughts, but there's no intention behind them.   


so if you, any of you, feel like there is no light, there's no way to reach your end goal, i'm your proof that it is possible. keep trying. keep trekking. it'll take a while, but you'll get there. no matter what means you need to use.

i'm rooting for you.",12
"for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto fb who died during the 9/11 attacks?. i lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when twc towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). i had no calls or texts from her, all i hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. this year i suffered a near-death accident. after it, i did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways i decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people i am close with. 

so for this year, i posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my fb. it was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). i wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""i'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who i am. i hope you are proud of me.""

a few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. she asked if i  loved her or if i wanted to get a divorce. she told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my fb. of course i love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so i felt guilty and took down the post. was i out of line here? i genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, i just wanted people to know what a great person my late-gf was.",3
"update my gf likes me to go by different names.. tl;dr: most of you were right, she was sleeping with matt.


here is  a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x4b5s/my_gf_likes_me_to_go_by_different_names/


i want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded. 

after i made my post, i waited 2 days to say anything to her because i wanted to get as much input as possible. i also took that time to prepare myself to separate.

i started reading comments right after i posted. i replied to a few but after so many telling me that she was cheating on me with me, i started to feel sick. i called my boss to ask for friday off for personal reasons. i spent the day driving around, looking for potential apartments. we don't live together but i wanted to make sure if things went bad, she'd have a harder time finding me. we also have some good memories in that apartment and i think i would be sad if i had to continue to live there. 

this brings us to saturday, the day i promised myself i would say something. i invited her over for breakfast but instantly regretted it because i was getting so nervous that i completely lost my appetite. she walked in the door and instantly knew something was different. i was hoping to ease into it, but i ended up blurting out, ""i met matt blank"". she tried to act casual about it, but i could tell she didn't expect me to know about him. for the next 3 or so minuted things were calm, i talked about how i see the past 4 months completely differently. she started to cry and say she was sorry, i don't mean some tears but full on ugly crying. i told her i'm going to work on forgiving her, because if i don't i think it will eat me up inside. i won't forget what happened but i'll at least try to move on. she started to talk about how she'll work on building my trust again. i interrupted her by saying that that isn't necessary, as we were no longer together. 

if i wasn't so emotionally crushed, i would have been amazed at the transition. she started begging me to give her another chance. i stood up and went to my room to grab a few boxes of all the gifts she gave me. i told her that i had already made up my mind to break up with her. after some back and forth, she realized that i was serious. i knew the exact moment she knew i was serious because she went from crying to yelling. it started off with insults and when that didn't work she tried throwing the truth in my face to hurt me. it started off that i was fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, and i had a useless job. in the middle of her tirade, she said matt's dick was way bigger than mine.

as she was yelling at me, she ended up saying what happened between the two of them. i'll summarize below:

she started sleeping with matt 3 years ago, they were on some sort of work trip and ended up drunkenly sleeping together. from there it went from once in a while to once a week. matt called things off 4 months ago because he met a girl. i think she was using the vacations because she missed being with matt. 

i don't really remember the rest of saturday. i spent sunday with my friends which helped, i told them what happened which was nice to get off my chest. i went to work as normal yesterday, at some point in the day she slipped a note under my door. i'm not sure what it said because i burned it. ",7
"my ex proposed. i said no. he is now talking about suing me. advice?. just want to say this is going to sound insane but i am not trolling/making it up.

me and this guy were together for 3 years. we're 19 now. we never talked about the future until a year in. before then i'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

in short, i wanted kids, he didn't. i wanted to stay in ireland, he didn't. i wanted to get married, he didn't. when i realised it was a bad match i broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. this happened a few times over the next 18 months in this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

we knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something i would want further down the line, i wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. if i were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then i might have an issue, but when i'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

when i went to see him this time i was again, considering breaking up with him. aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that i really don't like. so when i arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, i assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so i wouldn't cause a scene. i don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

in the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. first he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff i liked and what my taste was. i assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so i told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. i also said ""go cheap"".

the other thing he asked me was how i felt about public proposals. i told him immediately that i, personally, disliked them as i felt i wouldn't be able to say no, even if i wanted to. i feel like public proposals are ok when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not ok at all. i assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

i never thought in a million years that he would propose.

so you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

the ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. he got on one knee, and held it out to me. we were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

i said no.

well, i didn't so much say ""no"". i ran out of the restaurant.

he drove me there, so i got a cab back, and drove home that night.

i realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but i didn't know what else to do. i could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all i knew was that i didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. i felt like i couldn't even speak, i was so upset about the whole thing. so i just got up and ran.

i just want to take the opportunity to say here that i really really don't care about the rings. honestly, when i want to get married (which is absolutely not when i'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and i'd say yes. i wouldn't even need a ring. i know i'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what i'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

i didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. he said that he thought a proposal was something i'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. he said that he was out of pocket for the rings. he'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. he linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). when i asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped i would cover the cost of mine. he said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. he'd hoped that i would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but i said no. he also said i'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if i was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

we both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on sunday.

he has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that i have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which i had no part in spreading. he says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. so €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

i think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but i am not a law student or a lawyer. he is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

what do i do about all of this? do i need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

thanks in advance :)

&#x200b;

edit:  he knew i wanted to get married but not to him. he not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. he openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and i told him that this was why i was breaking up with him the times before this that i have ended the relationship. during the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like i'm gonna propose"" (that one was last april)

"posting an update to my story using the throwaway format about my sil(14f) accusing me(26m) of impregnating her.. since this is basically over now i'm posting an update on what all happened. the old post was deleted for not using the throw away format so a quick summary. leaving out a lot due to this being mobile and way to much shit went on to cover here.

my sil who is 14 got pregnant and when her parents found out she lied and told them that i was the father.  my wife left to be with her family when this broke and her father was in a rage.  i got a lawyer.

the lawyer i got told me i needed to pack up take of work and stay somewhere we're my wife and her family wouldn't know where to find me.  boy was he right.  the next day our apartment was broken into by my fil and completely trashed with a baseball bat.  my neighbors called the police obviously and he ended up getting arrested but bailed out by my mil the next day.

my wife's entire family constantly texting and calling to say how horrible of a person i was.  my lawyer met with the family and their lawyer to tell them i denied all the accusations and that i wanted a dna test done.  after the meeting the texts and calls switched to calling me a coward for accusing my sil of lying.

this went on for a few more days before the mounting pressure finally broke my sil's resolve.  she came clean  and told everyone who the real father was, being a 15 year old at her school that told her to make something up.

when this news came out i still had to go through some whole bs investigation to show that i wasn't actually a secret child predator.  

i'm self employed so we will see how bad this whole episode is going to screw up my life and i'm definitely pressing charges against my fil for the damage he did to my apartment and threat to my life he posed.  

contrary to what most people on here suggested i do i am not going to immediately divorce my wife.  our marriage was amazing before this happened and i don't want to throw that away over a stupid 14 year old and her boyfriend.  i've seen my wife a few times and told her i understand why she did what she did and that i still want to be with her given that i will not want to be around specifically her father or her sister for a long time and that before we move in together again we get marriage counseling.  she agreed to those terms and we have been to a few sessions separately and together now.  

thanks for the input i got on the old post.

edit:  lot of people are acting like this whole situation continued even with dna evidence proving i was innocent, that's not the case.  there never was a dna test and likely won't be now that sil admitted and the actual father confirmed it.  the threat alone of a dna test is what made her tell the truth.

i also said i'm not immediately divorcing my wife, it may come to it after we have tried counseling but i don't know at this time.  yes i'm hurt by my wife not believing me but at the same time we've only been married for a year and a half and she basically raised her sister while her parents worked and has always been very close to her.  

my wife didn't cut contact with me through this i did at the direction of my lawyer.  i left my phone with him and looking back through it now she never accused me of anything was just asking questions trying to figure out what was going on.  

my fil acted out on his own by breaking in no one knew what he was doing and i don't have any sympathy for his actions and am pressing charges for everything he did.  he broke in not used my wife's keys to get in.  the door frame  was completely destroyed.",7
"by being young and dumb i guess. *i was 16 when this happened. golden age of fuck ups.* 

i hooked up with one of the girls from my church. we were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. i was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the big g. however the two of us shared one common goal. we wanted to fuck. which we did. but afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". she named and shamed both of us. none of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. 

so thanks to that confession, that's how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the deacon's daughter. 

*edit: thank you for the silver & gold!* 

*edit: okay, gawd damn. some of you are sick of all the sex posts. noted.* 

*edit: a few of you are asking how my old man reacted. every second or third weekend he dragged my ass to prison, where he would occasionally preach the word of god. being there scared the shit out of me and he knew that. i was forced to listen to ""rehabilitated"" rapists and murderers read scriptures out of the bible and give me lessons on what it meant to be born again and to live a pure life in christ... free from temptation, sin, all the shit 16 year old me was guilty of that time. i never had sex with the deacon's daughter ever again.*

"i always heard that you can save money switching insurance companies every few years, but never actually shopped around until now. found $1,715 in annual savings!. i stayed with the same insurance company for auto since 2007. i added my wife to the policy when we got married in 2013, and then added a policy for our home in 2014. i noticed that the premiums were always trending up, as though there was no benefit for being a loyal customer. i finally put in the effort to shop around and found better deals for the exact same or better coverage.

"ma man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. now they won't take it off until he verifies that we don't live together. he's blocked my number.. i bought a car last year from a mutual friend that i didn't know well at all. everything was fine until this past june, when he fell into some heavy debt. he gave me a call sometime around june, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which i refused. red flag number one right there. after this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than i should've been monthly for this car). i eventually just gave the car back and that was that. i gave the car back mid july and purchased a new one (nissan altima) from a legitimate dealer. this morning i received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. i calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don't live together, (we absolutely do not) i still have to pay it. this is absurd, how is this allowed? the guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can i provide proof for someone else? this is in massachusetts and i have progressive insurance.


update #1: okay so a lot has happened since i first posted. for starters, i should clarify some things. we signed an agreement that i would pay monthly increments for the title. until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. initially he said i would be under his insurance, but only a few days after i saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. i did not have the car in my name, which is why i was able to give it back so easily. i just thought ""screw this drama, i'll just get a new car."" today my adjuster happens to be ""out sick"" but i reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. a representative of progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. i have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. i've been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. i'm expecting a phone call and will update soon.

update #2: not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. luckily i kept all of the text messages between us, which i attached to the reports i filed. with my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it's a bit difficult to get this taken care of. after i settle this, because i am not paying an extra $500, i will most definitely be switching providers.",2

"found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens. this has been going on for several years. i live in a small rural neighborhood with an hoa where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. as with most hoas, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. there will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. it really annoys my husband. i just laugh at it

well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. there were a lot of emails sent about this. a lot of drama. i don't remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

so then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. some people thought it could be deer eating them. there were several theories. the next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. this year it started happening again and people flipped out. all caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

it started out being funny because i'm not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. but this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

so anyway, you already know what happens. i walk down to the bottom of our property that i don't visit often and i find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

i went inside and told my husband jokingly ""i think we're being framed for the onion heist!"" he got this really weird look on his face and i had the realization and asked him if he didn't have anything to do with this

he confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. he was sneaking out at night to do this. i asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

i don't even know. this makes me really uncomfortable. the man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and i didn't even notice? why wouldn't he just tell me? like this has been going on for three years it's not like he just did it once as a prank

i don't know what to do. can anyone help me think this through. maybe i'm overreacting but i'm pretty upset

"my boyfriend (21m) hates my (20f) vagina with a passion. i recently became sexually active with my boyfriend and he told me that sex feels very pleasurable but he doesn't like my vagina. he said it just looks unappealing and he doesn't wanna touch it or put his mouth on it or anything. he gave me oral once but he seemed very disgusted so i didn't push him to continue until i finished and i said he could stop. he doesn't like fingering me either. he basically just said that he doesn't like looking at it or anything. he said the folds are weird and it looks nasty. 

so i thought i had a vagina that looked similar like the ones in porn. my inner labia are not long or stick out and i'm an innie or whatever. i taste and smell fine. i think he just doesn't like vaginas. but he has a very high sex drive and he wants to have sex like 24/7 but it's just him fucking me and playing with my boobs. no attention down there. i do cum but i have to touch myself because he won't do it. it's just basically like he's having sex with me and i'm masturbating like rubbing my own clit so i can get off too. i don't wanna force him to do anything he doesn't like but is he ever gonna get over this aversion to my vagina? he's 100% straight and he likes boobs and he's attracted to girls and he likes when i wear sexy underwear and he likes looking at me naked from the front and he likes having sex. he just thinks vaginas are ugly looking. his penis is not beautiful i still put it in my mouth and touch it and give him a lot of attention because he enjoys it. idk it's weird. 

my friends boyfriends are obsessed with their vaginas. my friend told me that her boyfriend always begs to let him eat her out and they're always touching them and they worship them down there and sorry to sound gross but they always lick them out. not only that, their boyfriends are not grossed out about anything. my friend told me her boyfriend is always asking to tongue her asshole and he fingers her there sometimes. my boyfriend doesn't even like to ever look at my butthole. my boyfriend thinks it's disgusting if i get too wet and he said it's like a swamp down there and he wipes me off with a tissue and he always gets mad if i drip onto his sheets and dirty them. he will only touch me momentarily for 2 seconds to find where to put his dick and that's it. i get jealous sometimes. i wish he would be more accepting or loving or something. it sounds so stupid but writing this out is making me wanna cry. it's like he hates me for having a vagina or something. he's never even looked at it properly since the first time we had sex and he was very visibly disgusted. g",7
"if i played ""another one bites the dust"" at my brother's wake?. my brother died. he was an incredible, funny guy, i miss him like i lost one of my limbs. maybe it's stupid, but i want people to remember the person he was. my dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very catholic funeral service. he wasn't catholic and wouldn't like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn't know there. he'd think it's way too fancy, way too much. 

he and i had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, i guess). he told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""it's raining men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""highway to hell"" and ""another one bites the dust."" 

to remember him, i want to bring a speaker and play ""another one bites the dust"" at his wake. i would explain it to the people at the wake and say that i wanted to preserve the person he was. maybe i could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. there will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are catholic, so i've been thinking maybe not. but i really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. i think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

wibta?

edit: i didn't really expect this response, but thank you. my brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. i swear, i almost sense his hand in it. i don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

this morning, i talked to my dad about the wake. i suggested, as some of you did, that maybe i could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. i found a violin one that i really liked. my dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and i made. he actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. i hadn't really been thinking about my dad as much as i should have, i thought of him as opposition, i guess he cared way less about the catholic stuff than i thought. 

i also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. we are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

"the freezing point of carbon dioxide is -78.5c, while the coldest recorded air temperature on earth has been as low as -92c, does this mean that it can/would snow carbon dioxide at these temperatures?. for context, the lowest temperature ever recorded on earth was apparently -133.6f (-92c) by satellite in antarctica. the lowest confirmed air temperature on the ground was -129f (-89c). wiki link to sources(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lowest_temperature_recorded_on_earth).

so it seems that it's already possible for air temperatures to fall below the freezing point of carbon dioxide, so in these cases, would atmospheric co2 have been freezing and snowing down at these times?

"for ruining jeans for women?. i work at an office where i'm allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the ""no jeans policy."" she frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

problem is, for the past few months that i've been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. that is, until a few days ago. 

i love wearing jeans, and have always felt i could make them professional too. i was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. she said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

i said ""well, the girls get to wear jeans.""

""no they don't.""

then, my coworker, amanda walked in wearing jeans. i pointed that out. my manager confronted amanda, telling her that she wasn't allowed to wear jeans. 

in the moment, amanda appeared playfully mad at me. but i went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but i think she may actually be mad. i apologized, saying i didn't want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans.

edit/ update: wow, did not expect all of the responses, though i can't say i'm surprised about the polarization. at work today, it wasn't bad. only one other girl spoke to me, and she too was more playfully mad than anything. i do feel bad that i ruined jeans for the women, though perhaps one day i will work in a place where jeans will be permitted for all. thank you for all of your input and the silvers!",3

her feeling comfortable enough with me to tell me she doesn't want to do anything makes me so happy. i'm ecstatic that she doesn't feel as though our relationship is sex dependent, and that she's confident enough with me to tell me what she wants.

we haven't been dating for all that long, but this coupled with other factors makes me feel like this is the strongest basis for a relationship i've ever had, and the future of it excites me like nothing else.",12
"for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend's aunt in front of everyone?. i know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! 
i'm a native french speaker from canada, but i have a very pronounced ""acadian/chiac"" accent. for those who don't know, it's pretty much a mix of french and english with some local dialect thrown in there. pretty common in the maritimes, where i still live. i'm perfectly bilingual in both languages.

i started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks english, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they've all been really great, except for one of his aunts. she says she was a french teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in france, and she insists on only talking to me in french. i agreed at first since i didn't want to be rude to his family but it's getting super weird. i don't understand how she was able to teach kids english or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like i have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope i'm right because it makes absolutely no sense. (example: she said ""a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche"" which roughly translates to ""to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth"" when she meant ""this pumpkin pie tastes delicious"") 
she constantly criticizes my ""accent"".  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me i need to ""pick a language"" when i accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper ""français standard"" is actually getting harder for me since i've been only studying/working in english). 

so last night during dinner she started going on about how acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total bs, and obviously weirdly directed at me. for the rest of the night i stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like i didn't understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. i wasn't trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the french and ignored me for the rest of the night.  
turns out she was super pissed and told everyone i was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. looking back i think i might've taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and i feel bad. my boyfriend said i was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. here?


edit: forgot to mention that i told her a few years ago that it's hard for me to fully speak proper french as i spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain acadian culture (she wasn't having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",3
"i tried to miscarry my baby and hurt her permanently. when i was 15, i got myself pregnant unintentionally. i was a very promiscuous horny teenager and i wasn't exactly safe about it. sometimes i used condoms, sometimes i didn't. i got really worried when i started experiencing the usual symptoms of morning headaches and nausea and skipped my period, so i took a pregnancy test and what i feared was true, i was pregnant.


i had no idea how to react to this. for one i was utterly terrified and i wanted to get rid of it. in a way it felt parasitic, the thing inside me with the power to fuck my life up. i have very christian parents who would have disowned me for having an abortion, but i knew they would actually love to raise this kid. however, i hated the idea. i had problems with eating at the time and didn't want to gain the pregnancy weight and i just didn't want a child.


i guess i'm making excuses, even now. i started a smoking habit very promptly, since i'd heard in science lessons that one of the effects of smoking can be miscarriage. i barely ate at all, and if i did i threw it up, all in the hopes of starving it as if i was trying to get rid of a fever. it didn't work. i gave birth to her far too early and as a result she is blind. i gave her away and haven't heard from her since, she's 8 by now. my parents were surprisingly supportive and i got the help i needed for my eating disorder and i still go to regular therapy. i just had to get it off my chest.


edit: i've realised now that this confession has come across as unremorseful. it was hard writing it, and as a result i focused more on what happened than my emotions. i want to make it clear that i really really regret my actions. it's very hard to live with what i've done, and when i was 17 i attempted suicide because i simply couldn't handle it any longer. what i've done to my child tears me apart every day. i still have nightmares, i still can't sleep at night. i can't tell you how many times i've wished and prayed to go back in time. however, i've focused on improving myself through therapy and i am training to be a nurse to help children. i know that doesn't make up for it, but i'm trying hard to be better.


edit 2: this is not the way to deal with this situation. first of all, always always always use contraception unless you are willing to accept the responsibility of a child, which is a life long commitment. if you're a woman, don't trust the man to bring it each time and keep it in a safe, secure location. bring your own condoms, get on the pill, get an implant, whatever works for you. if you do get pregnant, don't be afraid to reach out for help. speak to your doctor or teacher you world. if you feel like you can't talk to your parents, but if you do think you can speak to them don't feel ashamed. don't do what i did. getting pregnant is not the end of the world. don't let it be the end of yours.

i have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  in my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions i rarely see him.  it has been about a year and a half since i have seen him and i was surprised to see him in my area today.  he has lost about a hundred pounds so i thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  i said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  he responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  we aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which i was completely expecting as i awkwardly stood in the hallway.

enter lady with four kids: a newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). she really really should have brought an ipad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. the mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. she was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. ffs at one point when i wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. my newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and i did not feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

i tried being polite about it ""sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""ma'am!"" -points to kid- the lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. rinse and repeat. i told her she needed to stay with her mom. little punk deadass says ""i don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


finally, i'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? why is your baby crying! make him stop! i don't like that"" and her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. so now i'm out formula, kid still screaming, and i have a huge mess that i don't have a great way to clean up. 

i'm at my wits end. i raise my voice at this kid. ""look what you did. i am not your mom, i am not your babysitter. you are bothering me. get out of my face!!"" 

people looked at me like i was the biggest bitch on earth. a lady speaking spanish actually did call me a bitch. the little girl starts crying. i'm not apologizing. the mom confronts me, i tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill i'm prepared to die on.

"i got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. after 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. i need help on how to handle this.. 
i am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

at 16 i slep with my good friend jared . the condom broke and my daughter was created. my parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. i couldn't bring it over myself to. i wanted to keep the baby. ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. so i did. i went to my friends house and his parents took me in. they weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

in that time my friend and i started to develop feelings for each other.

i had my daughter and about 2 moths later jared's  brother  came back into their life's. he was a recovering heroin addict. as we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. my parents got wind of that. they dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my mil also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

so they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. it was a dark time i thought they were going to take my baby. in the end they didn't find anything substantial.

but them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. as it was a small town every mistake i made got back to my parents.

i was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? cps charges because neglect.
i was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . cps.

christmas loads of people stayed at jared's house because it was a big family. cps because many strange men were there.

they eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. if they had done it more i think it could have been an offence.

the last call was 5 years ago.

eventually jared and i married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. we worked retail jobs and studied. it took us longer than average to graduate but we did. with a lot of help of his parents. jared is now an engineer and i work as a graphic designer.

we were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. our life's look normal now.

anyway a week ago i get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

"my 4yr almost made me cry this morning.. i'm a 30 male with a partner of 8 years with two daughters (4 and 1, birthdays next march). we live on a extremely high cost/low income island. i work 2 jobs to help provide for my family. we have debt (as most do) and very stressed. 

before i left to go to work this morning, just as i'm standing at the door i always say "" love you pickle, have a good day at school"" and today she turned to me and said ""have a good day at work daddy too, love you"".

i almost broke down in tears. i've not cried in years, even when my nan passed last year, i hold everything in. she really made my day saying that. it really is the smallest things in life that get you by and that sentence she said almost broke me. i've been in such a good mood all day so far because of her, even if work is currently stressful, she's getting me by.",12

"so, i just started reading a book to my girlfriend.... my (long distance) girlfriend has always liked going to sleep to the sound of my voice. every night, even when she's about ready to collapse from exhaustion, she'll call me up, crawl in bed, set up her camera so we can see each other, and wait for me to start talking. she says it's comforting and that she doesn't like being/feeling alone when she drifts off. i don't mind, she's so sweet and watching her slowly fall asleep is the goddamn cutest thing ever. 

and so, for the past year, i've tried a lot of different things; sometimes i'll make up a story as i go, other times i'll just tell her about my day or what's on my mind. you name it, i've probably done it. recently however, she told me that she wanted me to read her a story. i can't believe i didn't ever think of that! of course i said yes, i even drove all the way to her place to pick up a book of her choosing from her sizable collection.

last night we started reading the tale of despereaux together and i've never been more happy. it's small things like this that remind me of how much i love her. she relished every second of it; sometimes she'd ask me to give certain characters goofy voices, other times she'd sit there in a tense silence waiting to hear what happened next as i flipped the page. in the end, when she was only about half awake and only occasionally murmuring, i whispered my normal good night.

""good night, i love you so much!! have good dreams and a nice day tomorrow, i'll talk to you later.""

after barely managing to mumble out the sweetest ""i love you to,"" i've ever heard she went to sleep. it was so perfect, it was as if we were living out a charming love story of our own. now all i can think about is tomorrow night, i just want to spend more time with her. i want to hear her giggle at my bad french accent, i want to see the particular face she makes when a character she doesn't like does something, most of all i just want her to wake up so i can tell her how much i love her. she really is a blessing, i'm lucky to have someone so kind and pure.

tl;dr: my girlfriend wanted me to read a book to her, it went very well. i love her to bits.

"- i missed my daughter's award ceremony because of my son, she's still not speaking to me. this might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

i've been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. he's not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. he's been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it's helped somewhat.

their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son's main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

my daughter was graduating from college last year. a week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. i was obviously incredibly proud of her. she asked me to come to it and i said i would. 

her college is two hours from here. i hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. right as i was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. i couldn't leave, and he wasn't calm for hours. i'd left my daughter a voicemail saying i wasn't going to be able to make it. 

she called back that night absolutely livid. she called me a shitty mother, said i had two kids but only cared about one, that i'd missed every game and performance she'd had as a child and it clearly wasn't going to change as adults and that she was just done. she said she knows he can't help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. she hung up and that was it. i've barely spoken with her since. she didn't send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. she hasn't shown up for holidays and i've heard she's engaged but didn't call to tell me. she's cut us out, and in the one of three times we've spoken since she said it's easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn't have to bother getting her hopes up i might come now. 

- i've offered family counselling and all other manner of things. i know i wasn't a perfect mom growing up - i didn't make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. i'm heartbroken but i don't think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",3
"several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community.... if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.

however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other

the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

next, the pope waved his finger around his head. the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

the rabbi pulled out an apple.

with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. the jews could stay in italy!

later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened. the pope said, 'first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs.' 'then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us.' 'finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'he bested me at every move and i could not continue!'

meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won. 'i don't have a clue!!!' the rabbi said. 'first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger.' then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here. 'and then what?' asked a woman. 'who knows...' said the rabbi. 'he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!'",0

"i saw a women get raped and didn't call the police. she was killed afterwards.. this was in 2007, in chicago. i used to live in a cruddy neighborhood with a lot of abandoned warehouses and such. 

i woke up to the sounds of this weird screaming and yelling in spanish coming from the alleyway near my house. i had no idea what she was saying, but i looked over, and a girl was bent over backwards getting fucked. i just figured she was yelling in happiness or something loudly, and closed my window. about 10-15 minutes later, i heard her scream way louder, like a lot. i looked over out the window again and she was gone, and the guy was still there. i had no idea what had happened. i just closed my window again and went back to bed. 

next day, i woke up to cop cars all throughout the block. i figured something bad had happened, but i really had no idea what, and i was scared to ask because i felt i might be pressured to be a witness or something. i just stayed in my house and looked out my window. 

i would end up searching newspapers and internet for the next few days trying to find out what happened. i found out. the guy was a john, she was a prostitute. he broke her arm in the car, dragged her to the alleyway and raped her, then took his baseball bat and started hitting her over and over again. she managed to escape into the street, but he found her and bashed her head in with the baseball bat and killed her. he was arrested with a bloody baseball bat in his apartment and some heroin. 

i could have called the police the first time when i heard her yelling and saw them fucking, and none of this would have happened. cops typically take 10~ minutes to respond to stuff like that, and they were in that alleyway for at least 15 minutes. the house next to me was a vacant, so i was the only one who could have called the cops. 

i feel really, really awful, just absolutely horrible. i could have saved her life but instead was so sleepy that i didn't. the sounds of her screams horrify me to remember. i can hear them so, so clearly in my head. ",13

let's edit this a bit because people have made some fairly good points. i would say the most of the time, the kid using this argument is the kid who wouldn't pay attention. i hear it a lot from people who are bombing algebra and are just pissed because they don't think it's useful (it might not be but that's not the point). usually, what they're saying is ""i hate algebra"" and trying to sound smart about it.",6
"update: my ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (florida). **edit:** forgot to add this...my first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

firstly i would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive pm's i received. it was really overwhelming (in a good way). a few people asked for an update so here it is.

so a lot has happened since i first posted. i called in to work while i was trying to get all this sorted. one of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. my husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. my daughter went to physiotherapy. eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. i was against it but the court ruled against me.

i gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. on her second visit it happened again. this time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. the next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. the neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. they had to cut the brace off my daughter. my husband and his wife were arrested. they got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with cps. my ex lost visitation and custody and i'm working on making it permanent. unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. it set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. she needed surgery and is still recovering. she always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. i hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. right now i'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. that's my update.",2

"for refusing to share my extra income with my wife when she didn't share hers with me when she earned more?. when my wife \32f\ and i \32m\ got married eighht years ago, she made about 15k more per year than i did. our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. my wife was the one who insisted on this, and although i was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), i agreed since she felt strongly about it.

a few years after we married i decided to go to law school. long story short, i ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. since i managed not to go into debt, i have a good bit of money left over after i make my contributions to our joint expenses.

my wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that i get to buy most of the things i want while she is on a much more limited budget), and i told her i would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally. i think fair is fair since this was her idea, but i do wonder if  i am wrong for refusing to reconsider our financial arrangement?

"bank gave away my entire banking account. so last week, a check i wrote bounced from an account i have that i rarely use. it's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. i called the bank where i was informed that i closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". i told them i sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. after them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. i finally got them to open a fraud case. 

here's the crazy part. i call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. i finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. this woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. she lives in florida and i live in colorado. we do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. so she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. i figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. open and shut case.

so now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. they asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but i have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. the icing on the cake was i got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

do i have any legal recourse? do i just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? what advice do you have?",2

"insecure gf caught flirting. throwaway for obviousness. this is gonna be a long one. 

where to begin? girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. friends, coworkers, acquaintances. even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

fine. i love her. i understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it's not that big of a deal even though i've lost sleep over it. 

girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. one of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. while i can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. some of these stories i've never heard before. call it insecurity but i've never asked a woman if she's had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. i asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she's put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. what?

a few days roll by and she's continued these talks with this person. we've had our arguments and came to an understanding of 'if he does or says anything that crosses a line' she will end the friendship. 

but where is the line? he's already had her describe herself. explain past relationships. sex talk and favorite kinks. taking until hours in the morning. where is the fucking line?

i told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me i have nothing to worry about. 

well. 

i just looked at her phone.

and while i wish i didn't. i'm glad i can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. they've been flirting. the questions via text were 10x worse. and her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her s/o. 

but what's worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that i'm being insecure and allow him to chime in that i'm creating disorder. then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. and her saying yes.

not a soul.

nobody wore or did anything to celebrate. i know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion i spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. i'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state i'm only at school like 50% of the time, and i thought ""maybe this time i can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy halloween.

its safe to say i was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if i see someone else with a costume on i might feel better but this was overkill, i'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that i likely wont be made fun of but costuming will always be my passion and someday i will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

"by labeling the breast milk in the fridge ""freshly squeezed titty juice"". the repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.

my wife and i have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment it came out.  we found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

while i was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  that rest was very short lived.  the baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

when she read ""freshly squeezed titty juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  she woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  raised with no manners or respect.  she then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

my wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  she passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

i didn't get upset because i'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

i was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. i understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/nottheonion, r/tifu, r/eli5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

there aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all. the admins should feel some sense of responsibility when r/news removes important news stories just because it doesn't promote their agenda.

"my husband wants me to get a boob job.  we've been married for 6 years. i have smallish breasts which i am ok with but my husband is often suggesting i have a boob enlargement. i don't want to go through all that pain, i have always been this size and was like this when we met and it never seemed to bother him then. am i right to be upset? i have tried saying i am happy the way i am and that he was happy enough when we met. why is it now an issue? i don't want to feel insecure but i am starting too. he also often talks about his hair as he's becoming bald, it's absolutely not a problem for me and i made some small jokes about it in the past but he's convinced it is a problem. he wants to get an hair transplant and he usually brings that up when he talks about my boob job, almost like he would undergo that procedure ""in exchange"" for my boobjob. he'd probably look better with more hair but i still love the way he looks now and i don't need him to change. we're having less sex lately (about one time every two weeks) and i'm always initiating, i'm starting to feel rejected and insecure. what should i do?",7

"there was this tramp.. one cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. he managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. he took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

coincidentally the father drives up. ""how can i ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""just name your price - i'm a wealthy man.""

""ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, i'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""oh dear,"" says the father, ""i don't carry much cash with me, i only have ten pounds - but come home with me and i'll get more from the safe.""

""no! no!"" says the tramp, ""why ten pounds is more money than i've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""i'm rich! i'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

he finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""i'll have one holiday please!""

""ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""oh, any holiday i don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""ten pounds! you'll never get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

she goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. there - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""i've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""i'll take it!""

a few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""but i've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and i want on!""

""well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, i don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. come back at midnight when it's dark and i'll let you on then.""

so the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. it was the captain.

""hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

the tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

first they went down through the first class level: oriental carpets - 6"" pile. a genuine rembrandt on every wall. leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

then the second class: as above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""a room of my very own.""

""i'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. so that's what the alarm clock is for. enjoy your cruise.""

well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. one-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. he had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

he climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""that was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""where did you learn to dive like that?""

""um, well i've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""i've never seen..."" he broke off. ""hey, i've got an idea"", he started again. ""how would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. i'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""it's a deal!"" says our man. for the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""okay, i'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. we're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""okay,"" agreed the tramp.

two days passed, and the big day arrived. the ship was humming with excitement. everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. the captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""let's see what you can do."" and with that the captain handed him a walkie talkie. and the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the solar system...

he reached the board.

he climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

through the asteroid belt,

past mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""i can see him!"" yelled a passenger, ""look!!!""

the tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

not a ripple on the surface!

down through the water!

smashed through the pool bottom!

down through the first deck!

smashing through the second!

down!

down!

through the crew's quarters!

through the engine rooms!

smashing through his own little cabin!

and down through the double-strength steel hull of the ship!

still down...!

deeper,

deeper into the murky depths,

till.........

smash!

into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

up and up, desperate, gasping...

out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""hero!"" ""wonderful!"" ""amazing!"" ""good show that!""

and handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""well tramp, i have never seen anything like that, ever. that was the most *stupendous* piece of diving i have ever seen.""

the tramp blushed.

the captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

and the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""well you see...

""for me to tell you, i'll need $49.95""

the captain outrageously asked why.

the tramp said

"today i cried over the lawn. i am a woman who knows no bounds. i used to be married to a man who did all the ""manly"" things and made me feel as if i couldn't do them simply because i didn't know how or i wasn't strong enough.

since he up and left me for a girl he met on tumblr 8 months ago with only himself and his own happiness on his radar, i have changed my flat tire, got my oil changed, changed the filter on my furnace, fixed my garbage disposal, recaulked my tub and a final task that i have been dreading.

i mowed my lawn. that part wasn't the hard part. getting the mower to start was the hard part. i put the gas in, checked the oil, put starter fluid near the carburetor, figured out how to push the little bar down and pull the trigger at the same time, and eventually cleaned the spark plug. it took a good half hour to get it started but i did it. all on my own. 

when i finished mowing the front and backyard i stood looking out over my lawn and i cried.

after all he put me through, moving across the country for him, getting a new job, being promoted in a year and a half, him leaving me in a place where i don't have any blood family, having to adjust to live by myself after 9 years, paying for everything on my own, and mowing the lawn i cried for everything i never thought i could do.

i cried because i claimed my independence and my house today. i can do anything.

edit: thank you all for all the love!! i had no idea this post would do so well. i felt so stupid crying over my lawn lol i just wanted someone to know what i had accomplished. thank you all again ❤️❤️",12
"you don't always need to buy a new car to get the latest features.. i have a friend with 6 year old civic that's paid off and only has 55k miles. about a month ago, i was surprised to hear him talking about getting a new car again. i asked him why he wanted to get rid of his civic and he said he rented a new car on his trip that had proximity entry, push button start, and android auto/apple carplay built in. i'm not gonna lie, once you try and get used to those, it's hard to go back to a key and regular stereo so i understood where he's coming from.

well, years ago in high school and college, i used to install car audio, alarms, remote starters, all that. i told him he can add all those features to his civic. we added proximity lock/unlock, push button start, 7"" stereo with bluetooth, android auto, and apple carplay, and a backup camera. all that ended up costing him just over $500 but now he has a car that he loves again and doesn't have to drop 20-30k on a new car. i helped him install it but even at a professional shop, that's probably no more than $1000 total.

i know there are multiple reason to buy a new(er) car, but if you like your car and just want newer features, take a look at what products are out there, you might be able to add those features to your car and save a lot of money in the long run.


edit: many people asked, so here's a partial list:

- 2102t directed pke passive keyless entry system. works extremely well, dei makes quality products. most bad reviews i've seen online were from people that didn't understand how to install it. this is a kit for professional installers so dei does not give any tech support for diy installs. 

- the stereo is user preference since there are many to choose from but he got a pioneer avh-2300nex. if you want to go cheaper, i have an atoto sa102 in my car and it doesn't have any issues. but there are probably hundreds of stereos to choose from

- push button was a generic one he found online, i don't have the mode number. just find one with decent reviews on amazon. they come in different styles so that will be user preference as well. you also need an immobilizer bypass module if your key is chipped.

- backup camera was from amazon, they are all pretty much the same so pick whatever style fits your car best.",11
"gay people leaving heterosexual marriages are not brave, they're assholes. if you commit to spend your life with someone, you should be sexually and emotionally attracted to them (or if you're not, your significant other should know that going into the marriage). 

it is messed up to allow someone to commit their life to you under the false pretext that you're sexually attracted to that gender. just because you're not ready to come out of the closet does not mean you need to destroy someone else's life. because they'll be there, destroyed, alone, and trying to pick up the pieces, while you're out on a new journey of self discovery.",6
"i sabotaged my father's marriage because he cheated on my mother.. when i was four years old my father and mother divorced because he cheated on her. they had a really rough divorce and had lots of fights. eventually the divorce was settled and my mother and father could move on. my father married his mistress, who i'll call 'e' as to respect her privacy. my father was really happy with her and me and my sister got a stepbrother and two stepsisters with whom we got along really well. skip forward two years and 'e' started acting different and so was my father. me and my sister often couldn't visit our father because he had to 'work', whilst in reality he was free. when me and my sister were there we often weren't allowed to eat at the table, which seven year old me didn't understand. eventually my father started becoming more distant, he didn't wish me happy birthday anymore and missed a lot of important milestones in my childhood, like learning to ride my bike or plays at school. when i was nine my sister and i could only visit four days a month and had to sleep in seperate rooms. i vividly remember that during one weekend that we were there i had accidentaly broken a glass and 'e' had turned furious. she send me upstairs and had me take my socks of which nine year old me found really weird. then she showed me a piece of glass she held in her hand and said that this is what i deserved for my clumsyness. she pushed the shard of glass into the sole of my foot. i yelled and cried and tried to remove my leg from her grasp when i felt a hand on my shoulder. it was my father's hand, he was helping 'e' do this, i don't remeber what happened after that. 'e' also got into a huge fight with my sister and had pulled her by her hair down to the basement. after these two occasions and a lot of verbal abuse we decided to break all contact and tell our mother what had happened (we hadn't told her before because, well he was our father) . my mother knew this was serious abuse but she was too afraid to alert the police since my father had threatened her with violence before. skip forward another five years, i was fourteen and a freshman at the same school my former stepsiblings attended. once i saw them all the memories started rising again. my two stepsisters had become huge bullies and lots of people hated them. me and a couple of friends decided to retaliate and secretly put small bags of marijuana in their backpacks. apparently this had caused a huge fight in their home and my father and 'e' decided to divorce. after this 'e' got into serious financial troubles and my father became an alcoholic. two weeks ago he was arrested for assault. 'e' has alledgedly become a prostitute and my former stepsiblings have been brought into protective custody.  this has all been my fault, it was my idea to put the marijuana in their bags, even though they hadn't done anything to me. i ruined the lives of my stepsiblings and send my stepmother and father into a downwards-spiral. yet in some sick way i don't feel any remorse. my sister has been dealing with a severe eating-disorder after all the verbal abuse from  'e' and has been hospitalised twice. i've tried once to commit suicide because of my sexual orientation since i thought i was an abomination after 'e''s conservative christian rants. now me and my sister are doing better, though we still have traumas. we've thought about starting a lawsuit but because of our ages during the incidents legal advisors have adviced us to just 'move on'. anyway... i'm in a real moral dilemma: i did something that caused horrible things, yet i don't feel any remorse, am i a psychopath?",13
"cousin confessed to falsely accusing my brother of rape. he was arrested, convicted and later committed suicide. i have her recorded confession. what should i do with it? (arizona). she accused him of rape years ago. she was 18 and he was 22. it was false and never happened. he was arrested and eventually convicted. when he served his stance and got out he was broken. from what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. he tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. his record, his name on the registry and lack of options. he went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

yesterday was 3 years since his death. this cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. i said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. i went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). she told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. i asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

the voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? i want to make my brother's slate clean. not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). his son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. if so, how do we begin the process? do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

what consequences (criminal) will she face? will she go to jail?

and, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? of course this belongs to his son now although i don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). and can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? this conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

i know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair. so please help put me in the right direction.",2

"i almost killed myself yesterday. i prepared pretty much everything and have been planning so for the past several months. i live alone and often busy with work and school which is mostly done at home. my parents are thousands of miles away from me. constantly isolating myself till i feel like i'm forgotten just so things can be easier, less of a hassle, y'know. finding solace in random strangers and feeling a temporary sense of gratification just to get by i suppose. 

all if it just feels so...numb and empty.

so i grabbed my cat, gave him to my neighbor, told him ill be out for a few hours. went back to my unit, tied a noose right by the already set up hook near my window. took a plastic chair. slid my head inside the rope. 

and then a knock. 

it was my neighbor. it was just an hour in since i gave my cat over, he was knocking furiously and shouting that i had to get him back. i hid my setup and cleaned up, hurried towards the door. he had scratches all over his arms and a big ass scab right across the left side of his cheek. my cat apparently started acting up, crying super loudly and was scratching furiously at the door out of nowhere. i apologized and asked if he wanted help with his wounds but he declined. i went back in and decided to sleep it off. 

update:

the amount of support and love i've been receiving is honestly surprising and overwhelming and i thank every single one of you guys who made the effort to send me a message or comment their experiences and support, i promise that i'll reply to every single one. i had absolutely no intention for this post to boom, i really just wanted to get this off my chest and even now everything just feels like a blurry mess i'm not sure if i'm even actually making any sense at all. and to clear things up i'm unsure how my post history has any connection to the confession above. i live in a completely different time zone (the philippines) from the (im assuming) majority of the people on here and idk i just seriously don't have the energy to try and defend myself at this point. 

i do realize that i am actually quite privileged. but of course before pulling the ""i'm suffering way more than you, suck it up you ungrateful cunt"" card on me. do realize that every single person's hardships are valid and not all individuals are alike. we have different levels of emotional capacity/stability/whatever. i'm sorry life's been hard on you but that's not a free pass to invalidate someone elses experiences. what you know might only be what you see or what you've been shown on the surface.

i'd like the thank the redditor who gave this post a reddit gold, truly appreciated. and also, for fellow suicide survivors, thank you for sharing your stories, thoughts and insights.

i feel like i'm not expressing the gratitude that i feel as much as i think i should and i wish everything in my head were more concrete and i apologize. ",13
"by suggesting to my bf that he get testicle implants. i've been dating this guy for a few months. he has a fetish for petite asian girls, that i know. but he also has a thing for big breasts, which i attribute to his ""hentai porn"" fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. 

in the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. he would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me i'd be ""perfect"" if i got some saline implants to fill a dd cup, as a ""joke"" of course. (dd is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34c, but still insulting to me.)

so i finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. i told him most petite asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. he did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great i'd look in a double d while we were out having brunch. 

so i snapped, and i said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. well he didn't take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. he hasn't returned any of my texts since. 

tl;dr: i underestimated how fragile my bf's ego is concerning his balls and i insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.

edit/update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. i tried calling him to apologize since he's ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(

more edit: i'm very sorry if i gave the wrong impression of him here. words are very limited. he really is a good guy otherwise. i know and i hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. but i really like him (and his balls big or small!). i did not mean to hurt him this deeply and i'm just so sad right now that i hurt him this much. i feel like a terrible person. i shouldn't have reacted with cattiness that i didn't even mean because i like his balls just the way they are!

one last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies. not sure where this will go but i guess i'll see.",4
"if you use alexa, make sure ""she"" didn't subscribe you to amazonmusic unlimited without your knowledge!. i noticed i had a charge on my card for amazonmusic unlimited. i reached out to amazon and they said the subscription was activated by my alexa enabled device in the kitchen - no one in my house would have done this since we have a family pandora premium plan. the amazon rep told me if you request a song thats part of unlimited, it may subscribe you. this is crazy - check your accounts just in case. also, you can change the default music service for alexa i just found out - so that's my next step. 
they gave me a full refund and cancelled the subscription by the way.

edit: hi all! i haven't had time to read through all the comments, however there may be some questions about small children activating it etc.
it's just me and my wife in my household, no small children or any other guests within the last month when it was activated. my wife and i definitely didn't knowingly accept or ask for it, but we may have accidentally done it??

edit 2: ok a couple more updates for all the questions and such. mystery solved! i listened to the recording (all my alexa interactions are recorded apparently) and it was my wife's sarcastic ""ok"" that did it. no i didn't call and ""chew"" out anyone at amazon - i've worked my share at call centers so i'm not that guy - they knew i didn't want the subscription and refunded it right away - this was more of a psa for people who weren't aware - but most of you are; good! 
what did i learn: turn off voice purchasing!! thanks everyone for the tips and help.",11

"il neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). landlord hasn't done anything. i rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex's parking lot is included in my rent. i have a parking pass that i display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

i have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. i have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. i have also kept a log of every time i notice this neighbor in my spot & when i've contacted my landlord. (for what it's worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he's gone to reserve it, so i don't think this is just confusion - i don't think he owns a spot at all).

this past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. i confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. i once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, i shouldn't have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

well, apparently neighbor didn't listen, because last night he was in my spot again. i called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn't come or were talked out of it by him, because when i woke up this morning, his car was still there.

additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an hoa, & my landlord always claims he'll ""notify them"" when i make a complaint about my neighbor. 

i'm growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as i pay for this spot. with that being said, i'd appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. what can i do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. what actions can i take to ensure my neighbor doesn't get me towed from a spot that i am authorized to use?

update edit: i just spoke with the hoa. they confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn't even have a parking spot at all. hoa also said he should've never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won't happen again. finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that i can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot.

"old bastard here. the biggest 'out of left field' change i have witnessed is i have to negotiate a better price every year for household bills like electricity and car insurance. 30 years ago i would just pay them without question.. car insurance came in. they dropped the renewal by 15% just because i said i wanted to look elsewhere.  

it is a freaken game. the whole 'i need to see the manager' bull for authorisation to lower the quote.  

years ago i would have felt bad. now it is routine to ask for a better price.

"i have 2 master degrees and haven't been able to find a job for the past 12 months. i don't know what i'm doing wrong.. i have a masters in math and one in finance, both from state schools. finished both with 4.0s. i did my undergrad at a ""public ivy,"" but only got a 2.75 there. i was happy with my scholastic performance turnaround and only applied for competitive jobs at the beginning of my job search. as time has passed, i've been applying to anything and everything. i've been living off of a small inheritance, but that money is almost gone. i've recently applied to be a teller at a bank and at a local target - no interview for either.

"by eating a free gumball..  

i'm 23 years old, and i admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

earlier today i was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. during that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, i thought i would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

i checked four candy dispensers; all empty. one last chance. i opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, i find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. without any thought or inspection, i excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. at the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

so there i am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as i spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. i'm certain i looked ridiculous, and i'm still brushing my teeth.

tl;dr  i ate a free gumball which turned out to be fucking paintball. wtf",4

"by being oblivious to the notes my fiancee has been writing me.. obligatory ""it's 7 am. this didn't happen today, but very recently."" i have been packing a lunch for work for about the past two months. i pack it usually, but if i'm behind schedule, my fiancee will sometimes help or do it for me.

i got home from work, and we were talking about how the day went. she asked me how lunch was, and i told her it was good and thanked her again. after a pause, she kinda laughed and said ""did you like the note today?!""

puzzled, i told her i didn't know what she was talking about. she said ""the note. the one i put it your lunch today."" i told her i didn't see a note. but the way she said ""today"" made it feel like this wasn't the first time. i said ""wait. have you written me a note before?""

she said ""yes. have you never seen them?"" so apparently this is the 9th note she has written on a napkin, and i've thrown every one in the trashcan at work.

"i've been logged into my ex's facebook account for 2 years, reading all her messages and notes. the recent mass-log-out meant i lost access and i feel a massive weight lifted off me, and i've also realized how sick i have been spying on her every word.. me, female 21ish

when we were dating i let her use my phone to log into facebook, and she never logged out. she isn't particularly tech savvy and never noticed there was an extra device logged in, and didn't change the password.  


after we broke up, i was pretty emotionally distraught, but i understood and tried to be amicable. it made it harder that she later began dating my best friend \m\ and even though they were a much better match and i was happy for them, i felt increasingly left out of our social circle and was desperate for any emotional intimacy.  


when i realized i still had access to her facebook, i first was just curious about what she had said about our breakup to her new bf (my best friend), so i thought it couldn't hurt to take a peek.  


i saw that they were in the middle of sexting each other over fb, while i was reading, and the level of their explicitness made me unable to look away. i wanted to read everything that was being said as if it was me on the other end instead of him (i know, awful); but the further back i looked, i realized that they had been sexting for weeks, all the way back into our relationship.  


i felt hurt, but i also understood more why it happened. we weren't a good match to start with, and we were having other problems, so as much as the betrayal hurt, i never said anything because i read the remorse they seemed to genuinely have for what they did in their messages.  


however, i realize now that i also used this injustice against me to justify my own actions, my reading every single message they sent to each other over the last 2 years, and every message previously. only now that i have been forced out by facebooks mass log out push because of security issues do i now see just how much i violated their relationship and how awful it was.  


i justified it to myself along the way by always being there for both of them to give relationship advice when i knew something was wrong (because i read it) or when i knew that they were having a fight and i wanted to be supportive.  


it is only now that it is gone that i realize that i have been neglecting actual relationships with people because i was living through reading the messages with others, obsessively   


i feel more than ever like i need to move on and do everything differently, perhaps admitting to them what i've done.

"credit freezes are now free. starting today.. edit 4:
i'm re-arranging and cleaning up the post to show info in a clean format, so as to answer many of the questions than has been asked, because i can't answer questions timely any more, because this post blew up. but i want everybody to understand and use this opportunity. 

**what is a credit freeze?**

a credit freeze is when you put a hold on your credit record, so that nobody can get access to it without your permission. it protects you against identity theft. even if a hacker knows all your info, including your ssn, he won't be able to use your account to get a new credit card, because you will have to unfreeze your info before they can be released. now by law, the credit reporting agencies have to respect your wishes, as to who has access to your personal credit record. once you freeze your record, it can only be accessed after if you unfreeze/thaw it.

other replies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6dk0sx/

**why is this news important now?**

many experts agree that freezing your credit report is the strongest way to protect against identity theft. starting friday, you'll be able to do it free of charge. in the wake of a massive data breach last year at equifax that exposed personal information for about 148 million americans, congress amended the fair credit reporting act to require reporting agencies to freeze reports for no charge. equifax is one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the united states. the bill was passed in may(https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/free-credit-freeze/index.html). it is effective as of today.(https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/us/free-credit-freezes/index.html)

**how can i do it?**

to set up your own credit freezes, go to the freeze page at each credit agency's website individually: 

experian(https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html)

equifax(https://www.freeze.equifax.com/freeze/jsp/sff_personalidinfo.jsp)

transunion(https://freeze.transunion.com/sf/securityfreeze/landingpage.jsp). 

chexsystems(https://www.chexsystems.com/web/chexsystems/consumerdebit/page/securityfreeze/placefreeze/)

innovis (https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityfreeze)

nctue (https://exchangeservicecenter.com/freeze/jsp/sff_personalidinfo.jsp)

you will be given a pin that you'll need to lift or remove the freeze in the future. 

**do i have to do this with all credit agencies? i only have one credit card**

yes you do. your credit card reports to multiple credit reporting companies. 

**does this mean that i can freeze my credit score at 810? does freezing affect my score?**

no. a credit freeze only freezes who can *see* your credit record. your credit score will still be based on how you pay off your lenders. freezing does not affect your score.


**is credit unfreeze/thaw also free?**

yes.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6d4v8e/)

**how long does the ""thaw"" process takes before credit is available to be pulled?**

if you do the thaw request online, the law requires it to be done within 3 hrs. 24 hrs, if you do it by mail.

**what if i lose my pin? how do i recover it**

from several posts i saw, there are methods to recover your pin/ and access your account that involves snail mail. you get letters in regular mail, which i assume is for confirming your physical address.

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9hlps3/credit_freezes_are_now_free_starting_today/e6dg4bc/


**how accurate is this info?**

to the best of my knowledge. i will update as i find better info.

"for intentionally posting the wrong test answers on a cheating website?. backstory:

i failed my first 400-level  physical chemistry test 2 months ago. i barely passed my second one last month.i noticed i scored significantly below class average on both and the curve wasn't quite what i expected it to be. (that's ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high b)

side note: the class is about 60 people. unbeknownst to me, it fills up quickly every semester because people think the professor is 'easy'. i didn't know this. the class just fit my schedule and i certainly didn't think it was 'easy' after those 2 exams.

here's the catch: our professor is old and i noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones. i heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known site (it will remain unnamed)  and some students had used that to score a's and b's. (we can't really use the site for homework help because of our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which is extremely helpful). our tests are long -we get 2 and a half hours for each test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive the answers online. 

exam day:

i was extremely irritated when i heard this. this rage really fueled me and i over-prepared for test 3. i studied like crazy  for it because i felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from a regular curve. i was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time. i didn't know everything, but i felt pretty great about what i turned in.  i was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as i wrapped it up. 

once i finished and began walking out, i looked around and saw a ton of people cheating. i was so angry and so distraught, that i used my free time after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions. of course they had. i had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and found 4 of the questions had been posted online.  i answered all of them incorrectly, though i made the process look somewhat legitimate. i realized that if i answered those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn't answer them in the given time (i was right). 

present day:

i scored a high b, and the curve put my grade at an a. 

i had the fourth-highest score on the exam.

most students failed, even though i found this test to be much easier and much more manageable than the previous two. i looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results. we always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair. i saw that a lot of them (i'd estimate about 13-15 students based on what i saw ) used the ""fake"" methods i had used on those incorrect answers.  more students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident that i'd screwed some of the cheating students. 

i honestly can't say i feel bad about what i did. i worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly impacted my gpa and my future. 

edit: 
a common argument i see here is ""see you studied and did better! just keep doing that!"" 
i studied like a maniac. i didn't go out, didn't attend meetings, just had total focus on this one test. it's a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible because i didn't have much going on in my other classes.",3
"neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp. my boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. i've done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. my front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn't very visible from the street. i painted it to match the house as well.

few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife's never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which i chalked up to her being shy or whatever. however, recently i got a note taped up to my door that said she's going to sue if i don't take the ramp down, as it's an eyesore and ""reduces curbside value."" i have no idea what she means since you can't see the thing unless you know what to look for and really get up in my property, as confirmed by neighbors and friends.

she refused to answer the door when i went over to talk to her about it. i'm trying not to lose my temper over this but it's hard. there's been many times my boyfriend has been screwed over by so-called ""handicap accessible"" places, i don't want my home to be one of them. does she have any sort of case? i'm in washington.",2

"for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?. context: so a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called ""jan"". i am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. i'm a tall and lanky male at 6'1 and 155lbs. jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


recently, we had a watch party at jan's apartment for the michigan football bowl game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. my buddy and i were talking about whether our qb should declare for the draft or return. i said ""i sure hope he comes back, dylan (our backup qb) is still young and is still pretty scrawny."" 

jan has a huge crush on dylan and didn't appreciate that i called him skinny. 

this caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying ""what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you're literally built of twigs?"" ""you would die playing football. tbh i don't think you could even lift a helmet!"" 

at first, i took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. i usually got my leg pulled about my physique but i never took it personally. until she started making it personal.

""look at you, you're like one of those starving african kids on those tv commercials""  (i'm brown but not african)
""that's why dylan is a chick-magnet and my ex dumped you. you look malnourished""

she kept going and now i was beginning to boil. i wasn't even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. but then i snapped.

her: ""go lift some weights. it's okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.""

me: ""if you could tell me what your current diet is, i'm sure i'll put on weight in no time.""

*silence*

her: ""what are you trying to say?""

me: ""i'm saying that if i'm a malnourished african then you could be on the biggest loser. and i'm pretty certain you wouldn't win.""

her: ""no wonder ex didn't want you. go fuck yourself.""

me: ""and no guy wants you. the last dick you got was moby dick. fucking whale.""

at this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

since this was at jan's place, i figured i should leave (michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). i finished my beer and left. i got a facetime from one of my friends who is jan's roommate. she urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and i went too far. i didn't feel that way and i don't want to apologize.

am i the asshole?

update #2 on the bottom

update #3 on the bottom

so i'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that i had since i was kid. 

she always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

but to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. he has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

when we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but i couldnt cuz i really love my snake.

well now i came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

when i confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

i find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and i doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

i dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

i wanna confront her about it but i dont wanna seem like im being petty

"there were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today.. this came up while discussing movies with my sister. i asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. she said something like ""i'm not sure if they got the roles cuz they're good and female or just because of the latter"" and it really opened my eyes. 

the current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like wonder woman being exceptions). i found terminator, power rangers, castle, etc. way cooler when they made them equals with men and not simply trash them. also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? i remember when the chess player judith polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. now, with a separate chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. but i'm digressing.

power rangers vs the new ghostbusters is my point. females were part of the original pr team in almost equal numbers. they usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. that. was. awesome. the new ghostbusters isn't. 

now i'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

edit: to answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, i'm not making this up. women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. although this was challenged by judit and now by hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",6
"a good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. now his adult son is suing me (virginia).. so basically, i lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. he was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. we watched football together, drank together, and all that. i even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. the point, i guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. i think this point is important.




he recently passed, which sucks. then i learned he left me a little something. that little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since i had no idea he had that kind of money. that 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. so it's not like i'm getting the majority of his estate. but then his son, who i'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  i ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




i have three things going for me:




1. my friend was mentally acute. he had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. our town's not big, and i know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. hell, i even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. these people can be witnesses i think, though i don't know how civil suits work.


3. his adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. she came around from time to time, and knew her dad and i hung out and stuff. the first time i met her, her dad and i were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the south so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





basically, my point is he and i were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? also, what kind of lawyer should i hire? the lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but i don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.

in most of the cases, the company already has a budget for the new position, and also in most of the cases, they want to pay as little as possible ( unless you are crazily good and they are really desperate to get you). if they can pay you less and still make you happy (because it's already 30% higher than your current salary), why would they pay you more (even if they totally can)? ( such employers exist, but they are not the majority). same goes as expected salary.

you are worth what you bring to your new employer. you might be heavily underpaid with your current employer, but that has nothing to do with the negotiations.

for me, it is always salary and benefits upfront. if it is a match then i will proceed further, otherwise, ""thanks, but may be next time"". that saves both sides time and effort. they already know a fair amount of my information from my linkedin profile, therefore, what to expect from me, why can't i know what i can expect from them.

in the end i got back a few ranges, which i politely said i will not proceed further, and only continued with 2 headhunters that provide a number i am comfortable with (even though it contains the infamous phrase""up to"", at least i know what i can expect). 

am waiting for an offer, but that is a different story. (edit: by ""waiting"", i meant i got words from a potential employer that they are working on an offer tailored specific for me (i let them know what i demand and they basically agreed on the terms, but the details need to be worked on. i am not just waiting for any offer)",11
"aita for giving all of my coworkers a different reason for why i have missing fingers?. i have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. it's fine. i can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days i can't, that's the dyspraxia). however, i won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. i only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

i'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but i still find it annoying. i really don't get why you'd think it would be an ok thing to ask someone about, but hey. i wasn't raised in a barn. usually i nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

anyway, i started a new job about a month ago, and i honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. i felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and i decided to make myself laugh. when the first new coworker asked about it, i completely lied and told her that i chewed them off as a baby. i then decided to tell the next person who asked that i cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that i was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. all genuinely ridiculous reasons but i'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. i didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. maybe they just thought there's no way i'd lie about how i lost my fingers.

within about 3 days, i learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. i'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3d printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

anyway, i told this story to my brother today and he told me that i was an asshole because i caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. my argument is that i'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because i didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, i was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think i actually severed three fingers with dental floss when i was 3. i'll accept my judgement, though.

update: gonna check out here, i think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. a few reminders for people: i'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",3

"banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat.. in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

i used to take the bus daily to get to work. not a big deal, i'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

but every thursday was awful. every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. still, generally not an issue because i'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

but this bus company was not reliable. we have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. one day, a little school bus came instead. it had 9 seats. since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. so you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

i have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, i needed that time to sit down. so, that's what i was doing, as always.

the group gets on the bus, i've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. i look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. i take out my earbuds and she says to me that i need to give up my seat. the other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when i tell her i need it she says that i need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. i try my best to explain that medically i can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says i'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). so after a couple minutes of this i snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as i'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. she gives me a look like i just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

two days later when i tried to get on the bus i was told i was banned from the service.

when i called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. i explained the medical reasons i needed it and was simply told i have a lower priority because i'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as i ever knew. he ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as i know, but i feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

on my original post it was suggested a lot that i make a post here. i live in ontario, canada. i don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. i know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

anyway that's why i'm here for help. am i in the right to sue? for how much? i don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

edit: there's a lot of responses on here so i'm sorry if i don't get to everyone, but for now i will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the ontario human rights legal support center on monday. thanks everyone. i'll still be accepting further advice if there is more i should do though obviously i can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

people often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. however the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

it is way easier to see with an image(http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). if you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

"update: for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?. og post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)

it's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and i guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!

in my last post, i stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. at this point, i would like to clarify that my family and i are chinese and it is common in chinese culture to ""disown"" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. however, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. his business was a passion project on the side. my dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)

alrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. despite the chain of advice i sent her, she ignored me still. i regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. i was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then i received a call from my parents!!! according to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. she had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. my mom was very tearful as well. they scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and i believe she went in the next day.

i had no idea what made her finally break and return home so i texted her (first, i told her i was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. at first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. lmao. what a fucking asshole. glad my sister finally returned to her senses. she told me she broke it off with him and i sincerely hope that's the truth.

this past monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. according to my mom, she was begging that they do is asap, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.

the future seems pretty bright right now for her. my parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and i think it'd be great for her). she's officially starting next monday. i'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)

tl;dr: sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and mcdonald's. sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.

edit: forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. i urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",3

&#x200b;

a little backstory. me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. i blame him for it and he blames me. i won't go into detail here. we ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. while this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. we rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. one thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. and unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. in the 8 years since we've been divorced i have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and i've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200b;

well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. his parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at disneyland and he want's to take the kids. well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. he asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and i shot him down. it's my week with them and i get to spend it with them. i told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that i need to ""think of them"". i told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200b;

well, this last sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. when i asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. when i asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to disneyland"". asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them i was not letting them go to disneyland with him. he's trying to paint me as the bad guy. i sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. my daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200b;

i'm not though. i think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. i demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"".

"good news update! ca grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. brother sold his when they were worth a car. i left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. brother and his girlfriend want my half now.. mostly good news.

i worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

i got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. what my brother and i inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. my grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. she didn't do the same with mine before she died (i thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when i was old enough to know how to take care of them. there was no trust, she just trusted my dad. my dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. my dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. my brother found out i still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. that's how my brother found out i still had shares and they'd grown.

according to all that info my lawyer tells me i'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. i say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. the letter i received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

a week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. his girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. i felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures i might have given him some. the next morning i found all my tires had been slashed. screw him, i don't feel bad any more.

the rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise i don't know nearly enough about what i'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. a lot of the decisions i've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because i knew it would but because i had no idea what i was doing and left it up to him. i've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what i have. thanks for all your comments.",2

a few days after i posted that, i got a call from her parents it turns out she took her own life, she left a written message for me and the kids in english that was basically consisted of her apologizing, and going in great lengths about how she didn't understand who she was anymore. but she thanked me and told me she loved me.

the funeral was held in korea last week, i went with the kids. her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. they also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

however this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. even then there is a big language barrier between us. my ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them. 

i still have a huge amount of stuff to mentally unpack, and figure out however i am not panicking for money right now. i don't really know how to feel about this at all.

"by asking for vagina in a japanese convenience store. for context, i'm on a vacation to japan and has been staying at my friend's apartment for 3 days. to show a bit of gratitude, i wanted to cook for her so i decided to go for something simple like a chicken katsu.

i've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. this is the moment i realized that i was out of breadcrumbs so i have to go to the convenience store to get some. i am somewhat decent in japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? no.

as i walked in the store, i couldn't find the breadcrumbs i was looking for so i decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

me: ""sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

at this point i didn't realize that i mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". the staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking i was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. i repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. after the change of the staff's expression, i realized that i fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. i then explained that i mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

"for asking my wife to have an abortion. my wife and i (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. we don't have any kids and don't want kids. we had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. she's on the pill, but accidents happen. she said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. naturally, i was surprised by the news and her change of mind. i asked her if she considered getting an abortion. she said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. she told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. i told her i wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. she started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. she wont answer my phone calls.

i'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. i was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. i know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but i can't help but have a negative view about it. a few years ago i tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but i couldn't. i was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. my wife is aware of these points.

i just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. i also don't like kids. my wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows i wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. i understand why she thinks that, but i still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little i would be involved in raising him or her.

for asking my wife to have an abortion?

edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. if she ever wanted to stop taking it, i would support her 100%. i realize that i'm an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. it honestly never occurred to me until now (i think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). i see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. i'm going to get snipped asap.

edit #2: she and i talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. here are the main takeaways:

* i apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. i also apologized if she felt like i was pressuring her when i asked her to have an abortion. i didn't mean to pressure her, but i know words aren't always received as we intended. she said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows i was totally caught off guard.
* she apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. she said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes i don't feel like she tricked me (i don't).
* we mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. we've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",3

"i'm going to live rent free as soon as i leave my parents house. i can't tell anyone in real life because i don't want them to look at me differently. when my siblings and i were young, our parents bought a nice flat for each of us in a good neighbourhood for when we want to move out. we didn't know about this until this year. my older sibling is 25 and i'm 23 and we both have plans on moving out soon. we literally don't have to look for somewhere to live neither will we have to worry about paying rent! we both work good jobs and only need to pay a $25 service charge for rubbish collection and security. i feel so so lucky and blessed and thankful to my parents. such a huge burden squashed. a lovely 3 bed flat all to me. the title deeds are going to be changed to our names by the end of this year. i am so excited for this! i feel really so so lucky.

"update: i'm 37/f unexpectedly pregnant. my husband (35/m) wants an abortion and to keep it quiet. i'm not comfortable with this. what should i do?. my original post was some time ago, so newcomers may not have seen it. 

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50axee/im_37f_unexpectedly_pregnant_my_husband_35m_wants/



i wanted to give you kind people an update that is well overdue. first though, i'd like to take a moment to thank you (most of you) for your support and kind words. for the most part the community came through with useful advice. i really needed help and felt extremely lonely during my original post. i thank you from the bottom of my heart. 


an now on to the update. i'm 39 now and my husband is 37. i was able to see a therapist a day or two after my original post and had a good cry while hashing out the whole story. i told the therapist about the advice i got here (she hadn't heard of reddit) and she agreed as well. i went through with the pregnancy. my husband had the option (obviously) to stay or leave. he decided to stay. 


not only did he decide to stay, but he's the happiest he's ever been in his life. reminder: we were a childless couple and did not plan on ever having kids. our daughter has brought so much love into our hearts that we are both amazed. i see the world in a different way now that i have her. he loves our daughter with every bit of himself. amazingly my love has grown for this man. he has told me that she has opened up parts of his heart that he never knew was there. i understand what he means. the happiness that i feel is beyond words. both my husband and i are so thankful that we had our daughter. we talk about it every month or so and can't believe how much we would have missed out if we didn't have her. to top it all off, we have decided to have another baby! 


so thank you, reddit. your support helped me through a difficult time. i hope that those of you that took the time to comment on the original post see this update. 


edit: holy schmoly reddit. pinned and gilded for the first time! thank you for the gold, kind stranger. thank you to all of the wonderful, positive messages. i have read and appreciate every one of them. i'm glad that sharing my story brought a smile to so many faces (or tears of joy in some cases!).

"if i report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to hr for basically slut shaming me?. i've \f21\ recently encountered a new sexual partner. we used a condom, but after words i felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time i have ever hooked up with someone i just met. my previous sexual partners have all been someone i have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. while condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a sti, it cannot provide absolute protection. a few days ago, i noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an std. i have never had one before and i have no idea the symptoms, but an std was all i could think about. 


i went to an urgent care because i wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or uti) and if not, i wanted to send my urine off for an std screening.  my doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which i was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


it came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. she says based on my symptoms, i am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and std screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


as i'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" i sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""with all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". i looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". at this point, i was pretty fucking angry. you could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. i thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

i was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn i get slut shamed for it? i posted this in a forum about sexual education and i was getting advice to report her to hr. i don't want to go after anybody's job, but i don't want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

will i be the asshole if i report her to hr or should i leave it alone?

edit: for everybody asking, i was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. i just kind of stared at her because i immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information i shared with her so openly. so after a couple of seconds she said ""i appreciate your openness and honesty tho"" (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so i just said ""thanks"" and left. i was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. trust me, i wish i would have but i wasn't even thinking about going off on her. i was just embarrassed. 

also, she was a nurse practitioner. i know a couple of times i referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was np. 

and for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that i'm having more fun than u 😘


update

before i start off with the update, i want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) i am not heartless, and in the original post i even directly said i did not want to go for her job. that was never my intention and i even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you're obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. i also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody i just met, so ""closing my legs"" or ""quit being easy"" doesn't fucking apply. in game if thrones, every single ""whore"" had one thing in common and that's that they enjoyed sex. so if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) for teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. what you decide to do with your body is really nobody's business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

now to the update: 
i called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or np supervisor. they didn't have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the nps was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

first and foremost, i explained to the manager that i in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. i did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or pip to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

i explained to her everything that happened and before i could even say who the np was, she knew exactly who i was talking about...which confirmed that she's most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

i then explained how i confided in her and that i came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. i explained that her words didn't hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers and future interactions with her other women patients. 

the lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she'd ""call the doctor (her supervisor)"" right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. she also said she was placing a note and that the np wouldn't be back in the office until next monday. 

with all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! you've truly been so helpful. 

and for the people calling me a slut for this, i hope to god this same thing doesn't happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",3
"stop sexualising my job.. i work as a nurse. i'm currently seeing a guy who's amazing etc but when i was on dating sites or just irl almost every single guy would make some comment about how sexy a nurse is. ""oooo a sexy nurse"" ""bet you look good in that outfit"" etc. 

i've dedicated my life to saving and improving other people's. doing cpr on a patient for 20 minutes waiting for the ambulance to arrive because i'm on a community posting. working 13 hour shifts spending most of it dehydrated with a full bladder because i'm so overworked. getting covered in blood from a road traffic collision. comforting family members when their loved ones die. constantly monitoring my patients to ensure they recover as best they can. i spend 40 hours a week working in a super stressful environment whilst studying another 40 hours in the same week to make myself a better nurse. seeing more dead people at the age of 23 than most 70 year olds have through their full life. performing cpr on a choking child at a restaurant on my day off and saving the child's life and seeing the pure relief from the parents. 

this is why i'm a nurse, not to fulfil your sexual fantasies. 

my career is saving lives, not giving you a hard on. 

i'm dedicated to saving peoples lives and maybe yours too one day. 

please don't sexualise my career. it diminishes everything i've done and do. i'm not an object for your desire. 


rant over.

edit: thank you guys for all the kind comments. i hope you all have good health and happiness. here's my time to preach, please learn proper cpr technique, you may never use it but if you do you can save a life.

edit 2: some people asked for a reliable source on current best practice for cpr. here's a link from the nhs that gives technique for all age groups, from new born babies to adults source(https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/cpr/). if you're in an emergency situation doing cpr you can recruit members of the public to take over as cpr is exhausting.",12

"by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.. this came to a head on sunday night. i've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. she would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. this was fine for a few weeks. then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. i dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. that this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. i wouldnt know.

my mind jumps to affair. the love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. i figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. i basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. she declined, said maybe when she gets back. like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. so i follow her. there is a dennys down the road from our house. she gets out and goes in. im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. i go inside and i cant find her. nowhere to be seen. its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. she finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""how can you do this to me!"" the fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. my wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""you're caught, where is the guy?."" ""what?"" ""dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""there isnt a guy."" ""why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" at this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. in the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""i had to use the bathroom."" uncontrolled sobbing. ""what....you had to what?"" ""i had to go to the bathroom."" ""we have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""i dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""a dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. i just never noticed, never second guessed it. she stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. so many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. her  shame was brought down by bananas. i could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. so, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

tl;dr my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

"by rubbing my ass into a security guard's crotch... out of habit.. normally, students can beep into my school with an id card.

it's rfid, and pretty reliable, so most people don't take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.

i'm a junior, and i've been getting into the building the same way for years. i keep my id card in my back pocket, so i just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. that sounds a little weird to write, but i promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and i'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.

only issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. as a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our id out to show him as we walked in.

coming in at 8:00am, after years of habit... i was on autopilot.

i approached the security guard, he said, ""id?"" and i nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (obviously i didn't hear the beep, so i guess my brain thought i wasn't close enough to the ""reader""?)

it all took about two seconds, and when i felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, i suddenly realized what i was doing... but before i could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all ""woah woah woah! miss! i just the need the id, please, not a lap dance!"" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.

i tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. couple of other students saw so i'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.

tl;dr: decided i could bribe my way into school without an id by giving the security guard a lapdance... i was right.",4

"i 22f read my parents' texts and found out my immediate family pretty much despises me.. i honestly don't even know where to start here... i haven't lived at home for the past four years of undergrad because i function better when i'm not around my family all the time.  i think and function differently from them, which is something i thought was ok and not a source of conflict until this morning.  i'm moving in a month for grad school so i moved back home for the summer to save a bit of money.  the entire summer both my siblings and my parents have been very nasty (mostly in the way of exclusionary and passive aggressive behavior) towards me despite minimal confrontation or conflicts occurring.  it's been really upsetting but i've tried to push it aside.  i've heard them talking about me behind my back on multiple occasions and even seen text messages over my sister's shoulder between her and my mom calling me disgusting and really just trashing me in any way they know how.

i am aware that what i did was wrong / i shouldn't have done it, but my dad went to the grocery store and left his phone at our house.  everyone else was sleeping and morbid curiosity got the best of me, so i opened it (he doesn't have a passcode) and went through he and my mother's texts together.  i don't know what exactly i was expecting to find, perhaps a few sparing texts about me, i don't know, but i was completely shocked to find that the majority of their conversations are about how much they despise me.  like this is to the point where they purposely plan family lunches/dinners/movie nights/etc when they *know* i am working or otherwise busy and invite me even though they know i can't go so that it's not obvious they don't want me in attendance.  i'm not even worthy of a name in their conversations, as my dad merely refers to me as ""the bitch"" and my mother follows suit.  my mom says things like ""it's so funny how she acts like her life is so great but she can't be genuinely happy because she is the most miserable bitch i have ever met.""  they say i bring down the mood, i walk into the room and i'm a bitch, etc.

there are also several texts where my dad will message my mom complaining about how annoying i'm being and she will respond saying my sister and brother are also texting her the same thing and they'll laugh about it.  so while i'm in the room with my entire family, they are texting about how insufferable i am.

i think the worst thing of all is that my sister outed me to my entire family.  i came out to her in december after being closeted for years and it was a very huge step for me to do this as my family is not very supportive of the lgbtq+ community and i was terrified to tell anyone.  i told her i wasn't ready to share this information with anyone and she turned around and told everyone in my family about it.  they are ""sickened"" by my ""lifestyle"" and have no issue with her mistreating me because she disagrees with my ""lifestyle"" (yes, that is what they are calling it).

growing up i was always straight-laced, kept my head down, and did what i was supposed to.  i am good in school and got involved with community service/volunteering and excelled in varsity sports.  i've also worked since i was fourteen.  i pay for all of my expenses and never ask for a thing from my parents.  in college i had a 4.0 and i got into multiple top phd programs straight out of undergrad.  i won multiple prestigious awards in undergrad whose ceremonies both my parents never bothered showing up at.  i am the black sheep and they abuse me for it.

i know snooping was wrong and i'm not sure what i expected to find doing something like this but damn, this hurts like hell.  i've always felt generally ostracized and sort of disliked by my family but i tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety going into overdrive and brushed it off.  but these were not mere hunches, they are true.  i feel sick to my stomach and absolutely numb, and i'm honestly not sure how i should proceed from here.  should i try to bring things up with my family?  should i just bide my time for the next few weeks until i move?

tldr: i knew my family was talking about me behind my back so i read my parents' texts and found horrible messages about me and also found out that my sister outed me to my family.

&#x200b;

**edit:** thank you so much everyone for the outpour of support, kindness, and advice.  i initially really just needed to get this off my chest and find a soundboard in the reddit community but you all have rallied and helped me significantly.  i am trying my best to respond to your numerous comments, messages, and pms offering support and love but there are a lot to go through so please know i see you and appreciate you very much!

some people have shared that i've come across as very superior- and pretentious-sounding in the comments.  i want to apologize for that and express that this was not my intention.  i was simply trying to share that i've had multiple achievements that i would like to *share* and *celebrate* with my family, but instead they seem to scorn me for them.  success should be shared amongst families, not be a divisive factor!

**edit 2:** just going to answer a few of the common questions i'm seeing in the comments here.

* yes, my family is religious.  they are catholic.  i am not religious but keep quiet about this and still bow my head in prayer at supper and participate in everything they would like me to.
* no, i do not spew my political beliefs to them or anywhere near them.  in fact, i hardly talk politics.  i do not post my views on social media or engage in political discourse on social media.  when my parents are talking politics, i merely listen respectfully and offer no opposition to what they have to say.  i pick my battles, and politics / religion are not battles i prefer to have.
* yes, i have friends.  no, my relationships outside my immediate family are not negative.  i generally get along well with others at work, school, and in social environments.
* my relationship with my extended family is positive and healthy.
* no, i am not adopted. 

&#x200b;

**edit 3:** copying and pasting a response to a comment on the thread.  a lot of people are confused about how much my family's mistreatment of me ties into my queerness.  here's a bit more context that i definitely should have provided earlier:

the issues with my sister started after i came out to her! this is definitely something i should have clarified, i'm sorry. here's the story:

i was dating this really awesome girl in december who has been out and proud since middle school. i was falling for her and realized that it wasn't fair to her to have to be dating someone in the closet, so i decided it was time to start taking steps towards being out. i figured baby steps were the way to go, so i started with my sister. my sister and i have told each other a lot of private information in the past and i thought i could trust her with this. i was initially hesitant to tell her because she has made ignorant homophobic comments in the past and casually uses slurs such as ""dyke"" and sees no issue with it. however, one of my good friends told me that her family was the same way and when she came out they realized how horrible their behavior had been, felt awful about it, and apologized profusely. so i figured that if my sister knew about me, maybe she would realize the weight of her unkind words. i told her and she was definitely surprised/caught off guard by it and acted a little awkward. but after that nothing happened and no mention was made of it. she began just acting a little stiff and awkward around me which over the course of several months has escalated into resentment and bullying. now mind you, my parents have been resentful and harsh towards me for the past several years, but my siblings at least usually had my back and i felt like i had some support with them. but once i came out to my sister, things slowly started to change.

in early july, we were at our cousins' house and i was in the bathroom. the house is small with thin walls and i overheard a conversation in which my sister and brother were expressing their disgust towards me because of my sexuality. so i realized at that point that my sister had outed me to my brother and now to my cousin. at this point i realized that she was really betraying my trust and clearly didn't care much for my privacy and well-being, but i still didn't think she would tell my parents, knowing their thoughts and opinions on gay people. well, she did. i'm not sure when exactly, but in their text messages they were excusing her mistreatment of me because they understand that she does not agree with my ""lifestyle.""

i'm going to paste this comment in a third edit on my main post because a lot of redditors are confused at lacking context. well, here is some more. this situation is complex and something i am struggling to make sense of myself, so before you make an unkind comment calling me things such as a ""bitch,"" a ""whore,"" and a ""cunt,"" among other slurs, please realize that i am in the dark here as well.",7

"'quirky' people who dye their hair bright colors and act cringey shouldn't complain about having social anxiety. if you dye your hair bright colors, wear abnormal peices of clothing, act out in socially unacceptable ways, etc, you shouldn't complain about having social anxiety. we all know the type i'm talking about, those kids in highschool who like wear tails or cat ears and inappropriate anime backpacks and say cringey internet things in real life. these same people are always the ones complaining about having social anxiety. like, do you really expect to have short, bright purple hair and not get glanced at? i'm all for people doing this confidently, you do you bro. but if you have social anxiety maybe, i don't know, don't make yourself stand out in every way possible?",6
"girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time"". so before your read, i need to say i have nothing against cuddling to sleep. i actually love it.

the problem i have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

and honestly i wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

but no, she doesn't want it like that. she absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

if i just start to get sleepy (wich i am because i want to sleep), she will get upset.

she absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because i have to keep my eyes open too.

she also needs sweet talk, wich i like but not when it's forced like that. she literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""i love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what i think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... and honestly i have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. and we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like i never say it.

but the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. and that can take some time. sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

i know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with so, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when i tell her i'm tired and i want to sleep.

if i say i'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""no ! don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so i have no say in it.

seriously, i think she's just being too clingy and childish. is it unreasonable to just say ""good night i love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? i don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if i don't do enough.

i feel like i have no control over when i can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for several hours.

honestly i wish i could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but i can't. it's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when i'm tired.

could i have some insight ? what do you think ? am i being unreasonable ?

thanks for reading.

**edit: thank you very much to all of you guys, your comments and insights have been really helpful, i will continue to read your replies and answer some of your question. i feel a lot better about the whole thing, and now i'm confident about moving forward and putting a stop to all this. i will talk to her and make her understand that she needs therapy if she wants to make it work.**

"it's fine to not like kids, but constantly talking about how much you hate them is just you being an asshole.. seriously. like i get it, kids can be gross and annoying and stressful. it's fine to not like them, it's fine to not want to be around them, and it's certainly fine to not want to have them.

what some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. even if you're not saying it to their face, even if they're too young to even understand you — you're just an asshole. 

also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. they have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. they are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. and just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

i'm just honestly sick of people treating little kids like they aren't people yet, like they're less deserving of the same respect you would give to an adult. it's so douchey and automatically makes me want to stay 3000 miles away from you.


edit: okay i need to clarify some stuff. i'm usually just a lurker on reddit, i'm not used to all this attention and i'm not completely sure how to deal with it.

i think people who shove their pro kid opinions down people's throat are down right awful. people have every right in the world to not want kids and as i've mentioned in the comments, i totally get why so many people hate kids. you're allowed to hate them! they can be nasty, annoying, mean, etc. in this post i was trying to express how people who treat children like they are subhuman are assholes. i'm not trying to insult anyone's lifestyle.

also, i deleted all the edits thanking the people who gave me awards because someone commented that it was annoying and i realized i wholeheartedly agree haha. sorry about that! like i said, i'm not used to my posts getting attention.

"for telling my wife that if she quits her job i expect her to cover all the housework?. my wife wants to quit her job. she wants to be a sahm to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


in order for her to do that, i would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on saturdays. i told her that i if she quits her job then i expect her to cover all the housework. i may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. i will will help out on weekends but during weekdays i rather rest. 


my wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and i am being lazy and discriminative against women. i don't really mean that, as i think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. i will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. aita?


edit: i admit that i did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because i was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. ofcourse, i also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",3

"i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately.. i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

this is a throwaway account, due to certain circumstances i worry for my safety of myself, family, & friends so thus the throwaway. 

i am currently residing in wisconsin.

i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

**information:**
my very first inkling something was up, is the day i believe this happened he came running crying into my arms when i picked him up, previously he was excited to be dropped off and picked up because he loved being there. and they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

after this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

that night i had picked him up, i changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. this is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or ""washes his hands"" with the baby wipes. this time he was not himself. he was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. as i took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, ""no! no no friends boyfriends name!"" and began crying hysterically. 

my heart sank. as a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. i know something was done to my baby. 

i looked my friends boyfriend's criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. this man is dangerous, and i didn't even know this.

**my concerns and what can i do?:**

notably in wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does cps investigate the person reporting? both myself and the party involve?

will the investigators / cps take this matter seriously when regarding my child's age?

how do i go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

what kind of things will they (either cps or law enforcement etc) look into?

if reported, and nothing happens, what things can i do to protect my child(ren) and my family? 

for a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs i can keep my eyes open for?

any advice, any help at all will greatly help. i'm absolutely devastated and need help as i'm at a loss.

**edit:** i need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why i'm scared for myself and my family.

**edit 2**: i am currently on my way to my appointment with cps and law enforcement that specializes in sexual abuse cases i will update later, thank you all so much for your kind words of support and advice, i honestly appreciate it and will update on the outcome.",2
"for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   i've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. you can skip to the tl;dr if the exposition is too long.

she's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which i honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. she can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

if you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' when someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(it doesn't stop there, she knew i had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as i walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. it's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

that's not it, either. she *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, bam, i'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

it's gotten to the point where i don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, i've saved up more being with her than i ever had in any other relationship. the only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

our anniversary was recently, and i had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so i suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""i'm not learning how to make sushi because then i'll *never* get a real date ever again."" we ended up going out instead.

it kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. she's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like olive garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that i'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because i've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

she also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste i've ever seen so i kinda think it's just an excuse.

i just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

tl;dr: so, reddit, am i the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because i practically have a private chef of my very own?

edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, i just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

edit 2: i'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. i'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

edit3: no, twitter, i don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. i buy her herbs and succulents. what flowers do i buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

also, yes, i wash the dishes

#final edit:

okay guys. this will probably be my last edit. this post exploded unexpectedly and i've tried to respond to as many comments as i can, but there's just too many of you. if you've asked me a direct question and i haven't answered, i'm sorry. my inbox is a mess.

i really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and i can honestly say that i've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. it's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

so her mom picked up the girls and i took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. she was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and i apologized for being stupid. after, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so i asked her to marry me.

she said no. she did it kindly, but she still said no. she said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

i'm pretty heartbroken. i thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

so, reddit, you were all right. i'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

"i like my crappy life. seven years ago i was 27 and living in chicago with my beautiful girlfriend. i was working a fairly coveted job making 130,000 a year. my girlfriend was pulling in almost 100,000. marriage, buying a home, all that good stuff was right around the corner. 

tragedy stuck and two people really close to me died and it made me question everything i knew. i expressed my hesitation with my life path and she gave me an ultimatum - put a ring on her finger within two years or it would be time to part ways. 

that was best thing she could of ever did. she left a few months later and caused some serious introspection from within myself. she knew what she wanted and i couldn't provide it. 

i look back there now and laugh a little. now i own a sweet 1 br cottage in the woods, but still only 80 minutes from the city. i drag my rickety boat with my rusty suv to fish multiple times a week. i go on the weekdays so it's quiet. i can do that because i work for myself from home - making a modest 60,000 a year, but i am my own boss.

i am relaxed. i am happy. i am healthy. i have met (and lost) some wonderful people. deep down i know that 9-5, a wife, 2.5 kids and soccer practice were not for me and that's ok. 

a part of me does want a kid though, just to tell him it's okay to go off the beaten path, it's okay to aim for something else other than marriage and kids, its okay to climb something other than the corporate ladder. it's okay to listen to yourself.

last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. it was my dog. i should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

i called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. i told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation i all but confirmed it. here's the problem, when i asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because i took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". i told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

i found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. i found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. she is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

"if someone doesn't understand something you're explaining to them, treat it as your fault for failing to explain effectively, not their fault for not understanding.. i've recently realized this is the root of most of the communication issues with my friends and family. i would try to explain something, for example: how to run the new dishwasher. if they failed to understand the process, i would get angry (not at them, just in general) and they would see it as a critique of their intelligence. the discussion would quickly turn into an argument and in the end everyone would just hate the new dishwasher. 

so i started acting like it was my failure to explain the situation...even if it wasn't. it totally changed the tone of my voice and made the person i was talking to more receptive to my instructions. instead of turning into an argument or debate, it turns into a constructive teaching opportunity.

"if your bank calls you, even if the phone number is legit, don't verify anything, call them back first. this may also get posted in /r/tifu(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu) as well ... 'cause i'm a dummy.

got a call today from my bank (caller id confirmed) saying they'd seen fraud on my atm card (telling me the last 4 digits of my atm card) at a walmart in florida.

i live in colorado. of course that wouldn't be me, and yes i do have the atm card in my possession. they never asked for the full card number.

while they put me on a brief hold to verify something, i did a reverse lookup on the phone number, it did match my bank. they sent me an sms code to verify over the phone, the shortcode of the sending number also matched my bank's sms shortcode.

figured everything was legit, gave them my home address to ship me my new card. they put me back on hold ""to talk to a manager"" to waive an additional fee to expedite sending the card.

but it was not my bank.

while they put me on that second hold they withdrew almost $1,000 in small increments at an atm in california. (again, i live in colorado)

i hung up, \*i\* called my bank, they verified they did not call me, had no record of possible fraud in florida but that the six atm withdrawals in california did flag as fraud.

i happened to record the phone call of the ""bank"" calling me, so i'm sending the phone recordings to my \*actual\* bank.

meanwhile i have to wait 10 days to get the $1,000 back. yay.

thank goodness for things like an emergency fund, so the lack of the cash doesn't hurt, but still a major nuisance.

quick edit: thanks for the incoming messages about this and the genuine support. many have had similar experiences, and i posted this as a reminder to all that you should always call your bank yourself to verify anything, never verify anything on an incoming call.

\---

**edit for clarification from several comment conversations:**

here's what likely happened: they spoofed my bank's phone number, asked me where i wanted the new atm card shipped thus i verified my mailing address. they followed my bank's verification playbook and said they were sending me a verification code via sms, which i then relayed. what was very likely happening on another phone line was they were social-engineering my bank, pretending to be me, verified my mailing address, verified the sms code which i relayed to them, and likely changed my atm card pin so they could withdraw cash. even down to my bank charging a fee for rushing a new card and waiving the fee in case of fraud. this was a very clever social engineering feat.

**also an important note:** there are tons of apps out there which can record phone calls, but the legality of this depends on where you live and the location where the person/business on the other end of the call are located. one comment has a link to a lawsuit where the second party was not in a one-party-consent state, which makes recording a phone call illegal. always tell your caller that you're recording the call. i miss being on google voice that could play a message that you were recording the call etc..

\---

**friendly reminder of the day** (besides drink more water, go out and enjoy some sunshine, and be nice to one another)

if someone calls, claiming to be your bank, never verify any information even if everything like phone numbers and sms seem to match. thank them for the alert, and tell them that you'll call them right back. do not provide any information to them!",11
"by telling my three year old daughter that i would eat her booty. alright so let's start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you'll be like wtf? 

so my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  and more accurately it's more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife ""mommy, get my booty! get my booty mom"" and off to the races they go. 

obviously this is a game that both parents play and she'll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. this get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it's cute and we haven't gotten any feedback on it.

this brings us to last night. the wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells ""get my booty daddy!"" to which i reply nonchalantly ""i'm going to eat your booty! nom nom nom"" since her butt was right next to my face. 

i immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling ""eat my booty daddy! eat my booty"" and takes off running. dear lord, what have i done?! i try to go into damage control and revert back to get your booty, but it's too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

i took her to daycare this morning, i hope she forgot all about it. i'm dreading picking her up.

tl;dr my daughter yells get my booty to initiate games of tag. with her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face i instead say i'm going to eat your booty! she now yells eat my booty to initiate the game instead. 

edit: a word. also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

there were lots of requests for an update after pickup. all is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them.

"in high school, i wasn't let into a party so i called the cops pretending to be a concerned neighbor which ultimately led to a racist cop beating the shit out of a classmate.. so this is coming from a throwaway because even though this was way back in 1991, there are still people who are pissed about this. apparently it was even discussed at the 25 year reunion and people we're genuinely still pissed. 


in 1991 i was a junior in high school in albuquerque, nm and i lived in the far northeast heights. there was a girl christy that was a year older than me but i had known forever because she lived about a block away. we found out that she was throwing an invite only party for seniors and as a group they had spent a small fortune on a keg of good beer (back in the day that meant corona), high end liquor and even decorations. it wasn't a normal high school kegger by an stretch. i figured that even though i was junior i'd known her for so long it wouldn't be a problem if i showed up with a few of my friends. 

nope, they were not letting us in for love or money. the kid ""working"" the door was even on the baseball team with me and he was total dick. when i asked to see christy she told me in no uncertain terms to get the fuck out. 

so we were pissed. we drove to the nearest pay phone and i called the police to report a super loud party that had spilled into the streets and now a group of teenagers were fighting on ""my"" lawn. the dispatcher wanted to know the address and then my address so i made up one on the same street, said my name was mr sevedra and hung up. 

we laughed and figured i'd sounded way too young to be taken seriously and decided that we'd tried. we went to hang out at our school's mcdonalds and figure out what to do next. 

maybe an hour later a steady stream of cars started pulling and we recognized them all from the party. the cops had apparently come screaming down the street shortly after my call and had surrounded the house on all sides. they even blocked off the neighbors behind the party house because they knew kids would jump the wall to escape. the police response had been so intense even my parents heard the commotion from a couple blocks away. 

we sat there trying to go along with the horror and not reveal our shock as the party goers talked about how it was such bullshit because they had specifically kept the party low key to not attract the police. the police had made them pour out all the booze so they were out a huge amount of money. and is if that wasn't enough, the police had found a kid of hispanic decent that went to our high school coming out of the neighbors yard and had basically beat the ever living shit out of him because he wasn't in the ""right"" neighborhood. he showed up to mcdonalds maybe 30 minutes after the main group because they had detained him but not arrested him and his face was completely scuffed up, his clothes were ripped and he was furious. 


my friends and i sat there the whole time just saying ""that sucks"" knowing that we had basically just caused a major incident simply because we didn't get admission to a party we weren't invited to anyways.

does life actually get better? how do you come back/get better from being lonely and extremely depressed? how do you create meaningful relationships when you are so screwed up?. ,1
"my mother (50f) asks me (20f) to travel home to wake up my teenage brother (15m). hi everyone,

this morning i was yelled at down the phone by my mother for refusing to travel 1 hour home and back to wake my 15 year old brother up for school. she has always babied and coddled him, to the point where he is 16 this year and she still puts his socks on for him, brings all his meals and snacks to him and makes zero attempt to help him mature. he is never left home alone, she tells him what to do and when, and both of my parents lives revolve around him. he does not know how to boil a kettle, and has never done anything independently. if he doesn't want to do something, he will have a tantrum. i would like to point out that he has no learning difficulties or anything like that that would explain this. he has just not grown up. my birthday day out to london was cancelled because he didn't want to go, and i was called selfish as a result. i am 20, i've been living away from home at university one city away for about 2 years now.

previously, she has asked me to come home from university to walk my brother 15 minutes home from school, at 4pm, along a route he has done 1000x before. yesterday, she called me to ask if i would come home from uni on wednesday to put my brother's dinner on as she is going to a funeral. a sad event, but of a relative she rarely sees who is very old and died naturally. i am not saying she shouldn't go to the funeral, just that it was not out of the blue. she had been preparing for this for a while. i said i wasn't happy about it, but i didn't have plans that day, so fine.

this morning she calls me to say the funeral was at 9:30am so she'd be back by tea-time. i thought great, no reason for me to come home as my brother is at school. but actually she now wants me to come back tuesday evening (late) after volunteering and a busy day. tuesday evening is the only time i get to see my boyfriend this week, so i said no. the reason she wants me to come back is so i can wake my brother up for school wednesday morning and make sure he locks the front door. i told her that was too much of an ask for something he can do himself, and she proceeded to call me a selfish child, and that 'we all have to do things we don't want to do' and that she has made sacrifices for me. at this point i just said i wasn't having this conversation and hung up. i then text her to explain that i don't want to come back for multiple reasons- my boyfriend, i have a busy day on tuesday, and it's just not practical. plus the reason she wants me to come back is ridiculous, as he is almost 16 and can easily set an alarm. i shouldn't have to travel 2 hours round-trip to wake my 16 brother up for school.

so, am i being unreasonable? i understand she is going to a funeral, but surely this is unacceptable. i am a 20 year old woman with a life of her own in a completely different city. if my brother had to be left alone for days of course i would come back, or if something sudden happened. but he is almost 16, and will literally be at school for most of the day they want me back. he should be able to wake himself up for one day, get himself breakfast and walk out the door- he gets picked up by someone else's mum before school.

any advice at all would help.

tldr: my mum is going to a funeral on wednesday and wants me to travel a 2 hour round trip to wake my 15 yo brother up for school. she has a history of babying him and i'm a university student with my own life in a different city. am i wrong to say no and that he should just set an alarm seeing as i have other plans? edit: typo. 

update: i called my dad to explain the situation and he said he agreed with my mother and that i was a disappointment to the family. he said it was not about what they asked me to do but that they rarely ask for help and when they do i should always help where i can- it was the principle that counts. he also said i was opening a can of worms and that there's a lot i should be doing at 20 that i'm not. when i asked what i should be doing he said driving, which is ridiculous as i live in a big city and the only reason i'm not learning is because it's too expensive and would be useless when i can easily bus/train everywhere. he knows this. he then repeated he was disappointed in me and i hung up the phone, upset, after saying i don't know want more they want me to do. i had a job i've saved my wages from so i can budget accordingly, i do well at university, i am good with money, i have responsible friends and a great boyfriend, i make time to see my parents when i can. currently feeling very hopeless and deflated. thank you for your support though, everyone",7
"i(f32) just found out that my husband(m36) has a full blown secret family because his ""other wive(f29) "" just knocked on my door.. sorry if this sounds so vague and incomplete. i am confused and my eyes are all swollen up

i thought that i had a pretty happy marriage with ""jonas"". we have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. we have twins (f8).

jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. during this time he will visit us and we will visit him. it is i convinient but he earns really good. so good so that i needn't work if i didn't want to.

during all those years i have never suspected him if cheating. he was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

so this comes all of the blue for me. jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
a woman knocked on my door. she introduces herself as ""cherry"". when i asked her what it was about she broke down crying. i took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about jonas. apparently she and jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

we were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. he has 2 different sets of social media accounts. and as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

at first i was livid and screamed at her. till i calmed down as she was just a victim.

apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if i visit) trough some bank statements. she searched his keys and went snooping. there is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

we both cried our eyes out together. cursed out jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

she is not legally married to jonas as he sold her the ""i don't believe in marriage spiel"". the only legal spouse he has is me. i know i have to divorce him but maybe i just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. also should i keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?

edit : i guess reddit only takes stories serious if it has happened over and over again.

thanks for the few helpful advices i have gotten and a serious fuck you to the people making fun of me or calling me a troll. i honestly thought that someone would listen to me here but i guess it's if i wanted that i needed to have better grammar and a less crazy story.

thanks for the people that did tho. cherry has left and i will pick up my kids from my sister's right now. i will be leaving the house for a few days to get my ducks in a row and begin legal proceedings",7

"my sister is in some weird cult - mi. no, that is not clickbait and i am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

okay. so my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. she came across a craigslist posting by a woman i'll refer to as aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. i never saw the ad, but i remember my sister telling me about it at the time. she was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. so she began a correspondence with ""aileen"". i did not live with my sister, i'm older by 5 years so i was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

so she ends up going to this place last august, i think, maybe early september. i have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. i was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. that right there was the first time i thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so i didn't push it.

over time, the tone of her emails changed. she would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""aileen"" much. then it gradually became that ""aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""aileen"" made her take drugs. seriously disturbing stuff. i told her she needed to get out of there, that i'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

i didn't know what to do at that point. i thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and i trusted her judgment at the time. it's not like i had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, i didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. yes, i was tentatively concerned, is what i'm trying to say, but i felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

my sister emailed me yesterday and i don't feel like that is the case anymore. something had happened and from what i was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. my sister was forced to participate in this. she seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. i don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

i stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but i couldn't figure anything out. i know my sister took a greyhound to lansing and aileen picked her up from the bus station, so i think this freak show is probably in either eaton, or ingham but as to more specifics, i have no idea. i don't think my sister even knows. i have a hunch they're in, or around mason because aileen made the kids spend the night at seven gables, but other than that i'm coming up empty.

i know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but i really need to know what to do. how do i handle this situation?  

good update: i did what a lot of people suggested with the ip address. i would have never thought of it, i'm not very tech savvy. she is in mason or at least uses that library. i'm going to contact the police there. you guys are rockstars.",2

"my (18m) girlfriend (f17), is threatening to kill herself every time i express discomfort, and today when i got angry at her and ignored her texts, she sent me videos of her cutting herself. i feel extremely trapped at this point. she was such a great person when i met her and i thought we would be great together.

unfortunately, for the past month, she's started to insult me for everything. for example, i could not hear a line of what she said over facetime because of internet issues and she flipped saying i don't pay attention to her. proceeded to call me names or whatnot. usually, i just took and it moved on. however, today i just snapped and told her to leave me alone. so i proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and i check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

i just ignore it because i really did not feel like it.  then she tells me she's bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. i honestly think i'm traumatized from those videos, i can't seem to get them out of my head and i feel responsible for them. i texted her father, however it was late so he's asleep. thankfully she's still alive and i've managed to calm her down by apologizing, but i don't feel right. 

i feel trapped, and very fucking sad. i feel as if i'm a monster and i'm causing her to do these things to herself. i never say anything badly to her, i just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. i apologize for my rant but i don't know. my emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

i hope i can get some advice. for some insight, i don't ever insult her, not even jokingly. she gets annoyed that i don't give her attention, but i text her and hang out with her as much as i can possibly give, i am human and a student with responsibilities, i can't spend 24 hours with her.  

that's really all. 

update: 
just a slight update. i have been in contact with her father and i am being updated on what's happening. they are seeking professional help for her and i feel that is the right choice for her. i am very exhausted and haven't really slept, so i'll try and give updates as i can. fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm. in my case, i've decided it's going to do me harm if i continue keeping her in my thoughts and anywhere in my life. 

my mental state was much more positive and happy before this, and i'd much rather regain my positive nature. i am very appreciative of everyone in my messages expressing their own dealings with similar circumstances. i've read every story and the decision i made has been influenced by your own experiences. i will try and reply to all the messages, but i apologize if i miss anything. i'll keep you guys updated if anything new comes up. i have decided to move on with my life and and get therapy to help me through this, and i hope she comes to see what i chose to do a few years from now.

thank you!
if my spelling or grammar sucks, i'm pretty exhausted, i apologize.

"my school is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (ga). i found this out about two hours ago. my  high school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

in the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; all students who drive to school using a personal vehicle must give the school a copy of the key or key fob.

after i read this i thought it was a misprint or a mistake. so i called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

about 30 minutes later i checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. they went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

&#x200b;

i personally find this to be a invasion of privacy. what can i do to stop this?

edit: campus is the only place around to park at without paying $100 for a parking pass.

update: the school removed the policy after a car was broken into using the keys from the office. thank you all for the help",2
"for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?. my daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. she has been begging for a nintendo switch. due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a switch. money isn't the issue... it's her behavior; she acts very entitled & she's lying left & right. i just don't feel now is the right time for a switch.

the theft: 

on easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband's aunt & uncle's house. aunt & uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we'll call her cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. she lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn't get many upscale things unless they are a gift. well, cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. she eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

my kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. she snuck it out of aunt & uncle's by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. she proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when aunt & uncle called & asked if we had seen where cousin might have left it.

due to cousin's challenges, she was utterly distraught over her missing gameboy. it's one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

i'm disappointed about the thievery, but i'm even more upset over my kid's attitude about being caught. i only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. it wasn't until i sat there & thought about it that i knew she was lying to me. once i told her i knew it had to be her because of xyz did she finally confess. her behavior only got worse from there. she refused to apologize when uncle & cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like she was the one being wronged. 

i feel like i need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing is not ok. i think that purchasing the switch (with my daughter's help from money she would ""earn"" by doing extra chores) & having her give it to cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

i mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... birthday... i don't really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. what do you think reddit?

edit: thank you all for the replies. i just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

also - i do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. not sure how or when, since i have a so to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***edit: i'll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying i'm ta for being a lazy parent. our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and i. my husband and i are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. he and his family hardly ever tell her ""no"" to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. i assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",3
"my 33 m wife 32 f hit me at a family bbq. everybody laughed.. i don't think i'd ever felt more pathetic than i did at that moment. we'd gotten into an argument. she wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). i'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. i didn't think i should drive. my sister was also urging me to go. she was standing right there when my wife hit me. it was square across the face. i'd just told her there was no way i was driving since i'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. my wife called me an asshole... then wham...

my sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. everyone around us laughed. maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but i can't say for certain. nevertheless i felt humiliated.

the thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. it started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). it was infrequent at first. she was always super apologetic. over time it escalated. she started throwing and smashing things. screaming. berating me. hitting, kicking, and punching me. i don't even know how it got so bad. it just is and i feel trapped. who in their right minds would believe me? who would ever think she was capable of this? sometimes i feel like i'm hallucinating it all and i'm just losing my mind. she was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? i don't even know.

now people do know and it doesn't even matter. it's funny. i'm funny. it's so fucking funny. look at him getting hit by his wife. so damn funny.

i want to disappear. i would if it weren't for my kids.

i don't even know what my question is. i don't really have one.

is even possible to come back from this? i wish i could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

"update: i 22f just found out my boyfriend 27m has been having sex with me when i'm sleeping after i've taken sleeping pills.. previous post can be found here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bovqbj/i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27f_has_been/) but the tl;dr is in the title. i have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. i'm pretty much dead to the world when i take them. recently, about 2 weeks ago, i found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while i was knocked out despite me saying that i wasn't up for sex before i fell asleep. i woke up that day because i was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. he didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&#x200b;

now for the update. after i found out what happened, i went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. i'm so incredibly lucky to have him. it was from his house that i made the last post. after that post, i was replying to the comments until i fell asleep. the majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that i need to break up with him and report him to the police. that was something i didn't wasn't to have to do. when i woke up in the morning, i had almost 600 more replies and i got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what i was going to do. so that is exactly what i did.

&#x200b;

i had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. i wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why i wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. i went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&#x200b;

so i called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. i started to explain everything to him and why i had to go away for a while. the conversation was going okay at the beginning. but then it took a turn. as soon as i brought up the fact that i wold him no to sex before i feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. he started yelling. he started throwing things. he got scary violent. telling me that he knew i was insinuating that he had raped me. saying i was accusing him of something very serious. i hadn't said to him that he had raped me. i hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that i was going to give him another chance.

&#x200b;

then things took another turn. in my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. i don't want to come off that way so i am not going to disclose what happened. i'm still trying to process everything and wondering how i could be so wrong about a person.

&#x200b;

i just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. you have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me i was the one who was wrong. i'm sorry i didn't listen to you guys. i was wrong. but i think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision i had made. maybe it was better that way because now i know for sure. i don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now i'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order.

&#x200b;

again, thank you.

&#x200b;

edit: some people have asked of he is now my ex. i guess i didn't really directly say that he is. we are no longer together. and never will be again. even if i decided to get back together with him for some crazy reason, my brother will never let that happened after what transpired that day.

&#x200b;

edit 2: it's come up a lot. people are asking to telling me to report him tit he police. my brother did report him. another thing people keep asking is what happened. call me an attention seeker if you want. i don't care anymore. what i left out was that when he got violent, he tried to rape me. if my brother hadn't heard him and pulled him off of me, he would have succeeded. it's so embarrassing, not just that i was almost taped but that my brother found me like that.",7
"my loving girlfriend. the other night we were watching a film together, we were cuddling and i was really tired and ended up falling asleep on her. she kept cuddling me for a while then rolled me over onto my side of the bed. i woke up a bit as she did this and as she kissed me on the side of my head and i quickly fell back to sleep. 

when i woke up in the middle of the night i realised she had filled my water bottle up for me in case i needed it in the night (which i almost always do) 

i know this seems small but i just felt so loved and warm inside because of this and wanted to post it here because i don't want to bore my friends by gushing about how great she is. 

i never thought i'd feel this way about anyone but i just feel so safe and valued when i'm with her. i didn't know it was possible to be so in love

"living in hong kong, reddit is the only place that reminded me what normal is. everyday, there are news of teargas going off somewhere, it's just the matter of which street or which train station. and i've been to all of these places, maybe to visit a friend, or maybe it's where my special pizza place is at, or maybe it's just a 20-minutes walk away from where i live. now it's all so suffocating... and not just because of these damn teargas.

after the teargas, people would be brutally beaten then arrested. those are nasty scenes, and you can see pure hatred in their eyes. some high-ranking officers called us cockroaches. you whip out your pesticide and stomp those creatures to death. and it just so happens that these creatures are us.

the local forum is a mess, seeing so many people trying to navigate this when we're equally clueless, trying to make sense with the broken pieces we could gather. people have gotten ptsd, and for those who haven't... for me, i have trouble sleeping. i'm lucky enough to be able to pay for therapy, at least. but not the others who need it direly.

"i stopped attending a class, lied about turning in a final and still passed.. i was reading through a few posts on this sub and found one that reminded me about a class i took in college.

&#x200b;

back in my junior year of college i took a class with a professor that i really did not like. he was so disorganized, absent minded and really didn't teach anything. the kind of professor that tells you to watch youtube videos instead of actually teaching you the subject. it took him weeks to grade anything and i don't even think he read them. it seemed like he was just coasting until retirement. 

anyway, i flew out to see my grandma one week for her 90th birthday. i missed a few classes and missed a few youtube lessons. well the following week my grandma passed so i flew back out for her funeral in turn missing a few more classes. i was really far behind and really had no clue what we were working on, flunked the midterm and missed a big project. at this point i just gave up and reserved myself to failure and retake it in the summer. didn't show up to any other classes. 

at the end of the semester he emailed me regarding the final project and final test. he congratulated me on a great job with the group project. really weird since i haven't been to class in months and was definitely not part of a group project. he was also wondering if i had turned in the final paper. i emailed him back and told him how happy i was that he enjoyed the project and i had definitely turned in my paper. 

well i don't know if he wanted to cover his tracks and pretend he didn't lose my test or whether he didn't give a shit but when i checked my final grades for the semester, i had passed with a high c.

"someone walked into a branch pretending to be me and got a debit card replacement. withdrew $1000 immediately. advice needed. this happened in toronto earlier this month. the bank is cibc. 

&#x200b;

yesterday i found out that i could not log into my mobile banking app and called their service number. i was told somebody walked into a branch with a fake id and claimed he lost his debit card. apparently the teller gave him a replacement and added a new contact number to the account. he withdrew 1000 dollar from atm. he then went to money mart and try to get more cash which caused cibc to trigger a fraud alert and locked the card. i have been overseas since august and won't be able to come back until next february. i have my debit card with me the entire time. haven't receive any funny messages or emails. i was told a investigation case has been opened and i should call then back in 10 business days. meanwhile a new debit card would be mailed to my current address (overseas). once i have received it i can access online banking again. i am quite baffled by what happened. i have chequing, visa, mortgage and line  with cibc. without online banking i could not access my accounts or even try to see if any other accounts have been compromised. furthermore i do not know what kind of personal information has been leaked. did the bad guys just know my name and address and then made a false id and tried their luck at different banks? or is there some other things they have got about me that made the teller believe he is the real deal? btw i have an obvious chinese name. which might make impersonating me a possibility. 

&#x200b;

right now this seems surreal and i just have a lot of questions. will i be liable about the $1000? any further steps should i take to minimize other potential losses? should i inform the police or is the bank doing that? can i make a police report while overseas? any advice is deeply appreciated. many thanks.

"can my parents force a paternity test update. last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can\_my\_parents\_force\_a\_pregnancy\_test/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/92evgg/can_my_parents_force_a_pregnancy_test/)

&#x200b;

i'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&#x200b;

pretty soon after i posted, i received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. i knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so i googled the law firm and lawyer's name. i couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so i reached out to them. the letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. they asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. i don't know exactly what's happening as i have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200b;

in other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that i also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. we still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

"if i quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? i would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. ex wife as well.. so years and years of backstory here. ex wife has bpd and life with her has been a continuous struggle. we are in the middle of a divorce because while she's lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. but she crossed that line and enough was enough. divorce is bitter and ugly. 

for financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. i implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. the both blew me off and ""yeah yeahed"" me for almost a year. ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. then getting mad at me when i said i had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

i've had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. on a lark i called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in nm. he said i'm hired. i talked to my partner and he'd gladly buy my half of the business. with the 50% id have to give my ex wife i could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. i could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

kids would be cut off. i wouldn't be able to afford any help. they have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. but they'd have to grow up and fast.

would i be the asshole if i do this?",3
"my 42m daughter 14f had a miscarriage. this is probably going to get removed but i swear to god mods this is not an update.

i last posted https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dsj4nn/update\_my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dsj4nn/update_my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) about a week ago. she decided to keep the baby, but for a while she'd been complaining about cramps and backaches, which we were told by the doctor will be expected and normal. i think they were a whole lot worse than she let on, but she didn't tell me.

around 1:30 am last night, the bleeding started and we went straight to the hospital, where we were told she had miscarried. they said it was a late miscarriage, which happens after 13 weeks but before 20. as soon as she found out, she lost it. she started screaming at me ""are you happy now?"" and just cried and cried. she had a d&e (dilation and evacuation) and the doctors kept her to look her over and understand why it happened. they said it was about a weak cervix in which basically as the baby grows and pushes on the cervix, in some women the pressure causes the cervix to open before the baby is born, which can result in an early labor or a second-trimester miscarriage. according to the doctor, most late miscarriages are because of that, and they don't typically check for it during pregnancies which is why it's usually not diagnosed until after the miscarriage happens.

the doctors told us her body will recover fairly quickly from it, she'll need some bedrest for some time but she'll be fine. her emotional state is a whole other problem. she wouldn't let me hold her while she cried and she screamed at me for a while after she woke up from the d&e. she kept on saying how it was my fault and i must be delighted this was happening to her. i told her over and over i was so sorry, i loved her, it was no one's fault, but i may as well have been talking to a wall for all she listened. all night long she cried, wouldn't eat, and couldn't sleep.

today she was a little better and had some lunch, except outside of her room a pregnant woman (not a patient, i think a visitor to the child next door) walked by and she broke down again.

right now she's in an absolutely horrible emotional state. i'm so worried about her, i'm terrified she'll do something to herself, she'll be wounded beyond repair, and she'll probably hate me forever. i can't even begin to think that this was ""a blessing in disguise"" which is what my sister told me over the phone today. there's no more baby, but there's so little left of her now. how do i help her?

edit: i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to reply to any comments before it was locked, it's been a busy day. i just want everyone to know, thanks for taking the time to reply. therapy is a must, i'll take a look into cheaper options, i'm thinking of reducing my hours, which may be kind of counter-productive but she needs me. for those saying she may try to get pregnant again, i don't think she will because of the incompetent cervix issue, meaning if she does she knows it'll probably end in miscarriage. we'll be looking into getting that treated as well.
for those of you saying this post is fake, trust me, i know how it looks, it seems awfully convenient. i don't know what to tell you, but that it's not. i had some time while she slept for a short amount of time which is when i posted. nobody was picking up at that hour and i had to get advice from somewhere, so thanks, reddit. this will be my last post and i just want to thank everyone who reached out to me.",7
"we should treat all chinese communist party supporters the same way we treat nazi party supporters. the ccp is a totalitarian government hellbent on control through murder, rape, extortion and kidnapping. they are the modern day equivalent of the nazi party in germany.

"my daughter is dying of complications from cancer. my wife and i don't agree on final interventions. how do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this?. i apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. too much ugly crying.

we have been battling cancer for many months now. her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. she could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. the other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

if she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt cpr. we have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

if she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. on top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

i don't want either of these interventions as i feel she has gone through enough. my wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. i don't want her to suffer any more.

i don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. we have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. a part of me feels like a pos for not wanting to try anything but i just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

what do i do to find common ground. i tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. my wife and i have agreed on a plan. we are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. please support childhood cancer research. no parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: i appreciate all the advice and i want to give another update. firstly, my daughter is only 5. i don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. either way this all happened rather quickly. last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. she was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called vod which came on her very quickly. within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

she does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. the medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. she has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

my wife and i decided to try intubation again but say no to cpr. she was intubated a couple hours ago. so far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. both my wife and i are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. we'll take all the positive energy we can get.",7

"yesterday it was 2 weeks after me and my best friend found his son(3) hanging on a rope on a slide in their backyard.. we just got back from the gym when we walked in the house. his girlfriend was there with 2 of their children, they have 3 but the little daughter was still in school. she was in the living room with the youngest, my friend noticed his other son is not there with his mother so he inmedeatly asked where he is and she told him he was playing in the backyard. they have a playhouse in the backyard with a slide, 2 swings and different ways to climb on to it, i think it is a typical playhouse you see on many playgrounds for kids. he told his girlfriend why she'd let him go alone and she replied that it was only for a couple of minutes and she was heading there as soon as she was done cleaning the youngest, the playhouse is not in eyesview when you are in the house. so my friend mumbles something and went outside to the playhouse, i followed seconds after him with their youngest in my arm. when i got close to the playhouse i heared my friend screaming and yelling and i heared him say my name and that i should call 911, i did not know what was going on at that moment but i knew it was bad,  so i rushed back inside and told his girlfriend to call 911 after i put their youngest down on the floor i rushed back to my friend. when i got to the playhouse i was shocked at first, i saw his 3 year old son hanging halfway in the slide with a rope around his neck and the first thing i thought, he's gone. my friend was in total state of panic and could only scream and cry. as i got closer i noticed his head was blue and again i thought he really is gone. i grabbed on to his body with one hand as i remove the rope around his neck and picked him of the slide, his body had no tension and felt cold, i lay him down on the ground next to the slide and moments after i started cpr. his lips were could and wet and i thought cpr is not going to help him, but i continued for some reason. from here i don't know what exactly happend but what i know is that i saw his mother running towards me and took over the cpr, i was totally fine because i knew she is a fully schooled nurse. i picked up the youngest, she carried him outside when running to the backyard, and walked to my friend who was still in shock and tried to calm him down, by now there was police, firetrucks and a lot of people in the street surounding the backyard. i went back inside with theire youngest so he would not see his brother or the commotion around him.

after 30min or so they left in a ambulance to the hospital. he had a heartbeat before going in to the ambulance and still had when they arrived at the hospital, there they putt him on artificial ventilation and he was in controlled coma. i don't know how i telt about that, is he alive, will he stay like this forever or will he wake up with braindamage? nobody knew at that moment. 

fast forward, yesterday it was 2 weeks after the accident happend and 1 week after he got to go to home, so he is already a week at home, still recovering but damn he is still alive.. never thought it would be possible. as far as they can notice for now it seams that he lost his filter/boarder meaning he does crazy stuff like jumping on the table or just acting goofy but with no limit, his parents have to step in to make sure he ""calmes down"". the other 2 kids are still staying at their grandparents just to take it slow and steady with their 3yo.

i am very happy that he is still alive. a lot of people told me i am the hero in this story, but i sure don't see it that way. after thinking and talking a lot with people who where theire i think that a lot of things happend at the right time so he could live. for example, when me and my friend got out of the gym i told him i wanted to go to the barbershop, he hesitated and told me he first want to go home to drink a shake en then we would take the boys and go to the barbershop. if we went right away his son probably died. and so there are a lot more things that seemed to happend at the right time and as i see it there are many hero's in this story! 

if you lasted this long i want to thank you for reading this and i'm sorry for my english. take care.

edit: he took the rope of one of the swings and used it to slide down, the rope was still connected to the playhouse and it got tangled around his neck when he wanted to slide down. his mother feels guilty, but nobody blaims here, it happend in a moment were she did not see the danger. she played in that same house when she was a child and never thought something like this could happen.

edit2: the boy is doing great! he has passed all of the tests in the hospital. physical he is able to do everything, he does have to build up some more strenght and control in his movements. mentally he is doing great, the only thing is that his boarder/filter is weak or gone(thats uncertain) meaning that he is quickly tired and sometimes exaggerate the typical behaviour of kids his age and needs to be calmed down. but they say it can get better.",12

"lpts: chrome extensions i wish i knew of back when i started college.. as i am about to enter my grad school i have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. as a result, i recently started exploring chrome extensions, and man i wish i had done this earlier. some will no longer be of use to me but i hope it can help others. 

**cite this for me: web citer**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
this one hurts me a bit as my days with mla, apa, harvard, and chicago are coming to an end. the extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. from my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as easybib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

**google dictionary**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
if you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). it's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. i imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

**grammarly for chrome**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
i often use bad grammar and i know it. this extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. it highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

**readability**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
this extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. i would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article i'd give this a shot. 

**speakit!**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-us)

i know i can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. this app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. or i guess you could take notes as you listen too...

it works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand german-english accents over the default one). you can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. i could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but i would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

**block & focus**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. there are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

**molview**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

i haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in o-chem or higher. it allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. i was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what i'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**bonus tips that i learned**


***make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. it will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***use sleepyti.me(http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** it's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. i cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as i stayed up too late studying. 

***use rainymood(https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** i'm sure many of you know about it but i love this one.

i'm sure i have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. feel free to tell me any i should try out!

thanks for the help!

she ended up taking me to court. her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before i even met her, and she married me knowing it). her lawyer claimed otherwise, that i had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. this was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as i had email communications with her acknowledging my record. she insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

she dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. he was a decent guy. ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. it's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

now we have never been rich, but we got by, i have always worked since i could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

now because of this i quickly started saving my money, pretty much, i would usually save up at least half of what i made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when i moved out and such.

so i turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so i wanted to see how much i had saved.

well you can see where this is going, i looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so i freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so i yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. she started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. i know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, i mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. my dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

well this was 2 weeks ago, i have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

in the meantime i have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

now here is what i said, untill i have every penny back i wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do i doubt i will ever forgive her. i need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",7
"my dog saved me from making a bad decision last night.. sorry in advance for any rambling. i'm not sure who to talk to about this, or if i'm just making it a bigger deal then it is. also on mobile. 

i went to hang out with my friend last night, just a girls night with some wine. i brought my dog with me because i hate leaving her alone and with wine night there was a chance i would be staying over anyways.

thing did get crazy pretty quickly last night and her boyfriend invited his friends over after dinner. it wasn't a big deal, we all had a merry time drinking, playing games etc. 

i don't remember going to bed, i just remember being in the guest room with my pants off falling asleep, just me and my dog. and then there was a moment when one of his friends opened the door. he kept trying to get into bed with me and i remember saying no, get out. he kept pushing though and walked to the bed and that's when my dog lost it. barking, snarling, showing teeth. he got out of there quick and i fell asleep. 

the whole night she was a total love bug, playing with everyone, letting everyone pet her. she's never had issues with anyone else in my bed before, not that it happens all the time, but generally she just wants to be the center of attention. 

i can't help but to feel like she saved me last night. i don't think she slept a wink because when i came home this morning she went directly to bed and has slept since we got home. 

she'll be getting lots of love and treats today. 


edit: 
i finally had a chance to sit down and talk with my friend about what happened. she told me that her boyfriend tried to convince his friend to not come into my room since the dog was there, and she said that the guy claimed it had ""worked for him before"" so he was determined. he came back stating that all he saw was teeth so that's why he didn't go in, but when my friend heard about the incident the next morning she was furious and told her boyfriend that this guy is not welcome over anymore and when she's hanging with myself (or any of her any friends) he is not welcome to join us. 

overall i'm glad she and i talked, i'm glad my puppy was there to stop him and i hope he learned his lesson, although i doubt it. ",12
"my family is abusive and i want to emancipate myself. i'm a 16 year old girl. i live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. my maternal grandfather also stays with us. my parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - i was in the car but i survived - and i was taken in by my maternal aunt. my dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

the last two years have been hell for me. not only because i still can't get over losing my parents (i cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. my mom was actually estranged from her family. she was white, and my dad was black. her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. they have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and i guess i'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

they have told me just that on several occasions. that my existence is a mistake. i get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. and i'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. sometimes it gets physical. sometimes it feels like i'm trapped in a minefield. i have to be so careful about where i step cause the repercussions may be explosive. my ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. he has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

i can't live like this anymore. i'm an absolute emotional mess. i wanna emancipate myself but i don't know how to go about it. i know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 i'm close with a set of twins at school - i'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. their parents own a farm and i work regularly with the family. i'm also into photography and i've been doing real good with shooting weddings. they are very lucrative and i've saved up a substantial amount. with summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but i also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

the parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. i've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. i don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

i would really appreciate advice.

thank you

"i got my skull caved in and it's simultaneously the worst and maybe also, the best thing that's ever happened to me.. i'll start with the bad stuff first: 

so i'm 3 days into my spring break with 4 friends in colorado. initially, i didn't want to go because i had a bad feeling about it. i actually called my mom a few days prior to leaving, trying to get her to convince me not to go. but she didn't, so i went. me and my friends made it there safe and we went sightseeing everyday, and so i'm actually having fun at this point. night comes and we all smoke some weed that we got at a dispensary earlier that day. some time passes and i don't feel high so i take one on my edible gummies that i bought. one of the friends that's with us is a giant stoner and tells me that there's no way that just taking one will do anything to me. i know that's not true at all but, i listen to her anyway and take 3 like she told me to. within minutes, i go from having a great time to being way too uncomfortably high, and she thinks it's hilarious. and everyone else does too. 
	
so i watch tv and try to stay calm until it wears off. when it finally does, i go to bed. before falling asleep, i lay out everything that i'm going to wear tomorrow when i finally get to ski for the first time in my life. i go to sleep so excited, it's insane and i'm still a little high. 
	
i start dreaming, at first they're regular nonsense dreams, but then i start thinking that i've been asleep for a very long time. it's like that little alarm that goes off when you've overslept for work or something. anyway the dreams start getting really weird, the first one that a remember is being wheeled into a japanese hospital, then blackness for the longest time. after that i would would have little flashes of waking up in a hospital room, with a view of a tokyo skyline out of my window and then i would start to vomit uncontrollably, which is something i'm used to because i have stomach problems due to anxiety. sometimes i would hear my dads or moms voice. but those didn't happen often, it was mostly black. blackness with only thoughts. as time went on, i started to become aware that i couldn't wake up no matter how hard i tried. at this point, i know that something is really really wrong. 
	
all the sudden, i have one of those hospital room dreams, and in walks kurt cobain and he asks if i want to talk, i say yes and then we're on a bench outside. he's asks if i know what's going on and i say no. i don't remember what he says happened to me but i had the understanding that i was in a bad way. then he said that i'm going to be fine and this is all about to end. then blackness again. 
	
then it finally happens, i wake up for real this time. guess what? i'm in a hospital room. my parents are sitting across the room, both on their phones. i can't believe my eyes. i go to run my hand through my hair and there is none. my head is shaved and a line of staples going from the part in my hair to my ear in a huge u shape. my parents see me awake and rush over to me. my mom asks me if i know what's going on and when i go to say no, i realize that i have absolutely no clue how to actually say no, or any other word for that matter. 
	
anyways, this is what actually happened. the night that i fell asleep high wasn't the end of the story. i actually woke up the next morning and drove with my friends to the ski rental place in the snow. on the way there we hit some ice going around a corner and started to spin. we where on a mountain road and ended up in the other lane right in front of a suv going over the speed limit. we were t-boned and so hard that we spun back into our lane and got rear ended by the truck that was behind us. i just don't remember any of that happening at all. 
	
no one in the car knows what i hit my head on, but i was out cold immediately. the stoner chick that i mentioned earlier was sitting next to me and broke a couple of fingers in the impact and demanded to get out. her door was smashed shut and so she decided to crawl over my body, knocking me over in the process, she also wasn't wearing a seatbelt. i started to bleed profusely out of my nose, mouth, and ears. this was because i had sustained a 3 inch depression fracture on my temple in the crash which had shifted my brain the the other side of my skull, as well as two other skull fractures. i also broke my nose, both cheekbones, and my tailbone. i was loaded into a ambulance and taken on a 2 hour ride to level 1 trauma center. i was intubated and sedated. my parents were called and left work the get on a flight from texas to colorado immediately. i got my skull put back together with hardware and i remained in a coma for 4 days until they realized that i had gotten pneumonia, which almost killed me. so 8 days later, i woke up. 
	
the expectation for someone with my injury would be a pretty dramatic change in quality of life, but i woke up and mentally i was pretty normal, it took some work, but i started to walking again. and quickly i basically learned how to talk again, although i talk very slow. every doctor i've talk to since, has said a that i'm beyond lucky. i'm a little slower now and i can't function without stimulants. but everything is different now, i don't even feel like the same person at all sometimes. i think of the person i was before the accident in the way you'd probably remember a friend that had passed away. it's fucking weird. it feels like i had all these memories uploaded into me. the whole thing has been such a colossal mindfuck. 

here's the good part:

	i sat in that hospital bed and thought about my whole life and how since early childhood i've felt this dark cloud over me, and suddenly it was gone. like i had been miserable my whole life. i've thought all of the horrible things about myself my whole life and i realized it's all bullshit. i am attractive, i am worthy of love, i am smart, i have great judgment, and people fucking love me. for so long i was paralyzed by these feelings and after almost losing my life, i realized what i really have. and beyond that, i'm not afraid of anything. what else can life do to me? what's the pain of rejection compared to the pain of that i've already gone through? it's nothing.

it's been just 3.5 months since the accident and i spent a month in the hospital but i'm finally back to life. and i'm determined to live it the best way that i can. i've found the power of positive thinking and i know now that's the only way that i made it through this. i've started to take up for myself and believe in myself. it sounds crazy, but i feel like this experience has taught me so much that i'm actually grateful for it in some ways. life actually looks beautiful to me now. i'm so glad i'm only 24 and there's still time to enjoy it!",12

"reminder: you can negotiate your hospital/medical bills down, even if you have insurance. i knocked 30% off my bill for an in-home sleep study with just two phone calls.. *tl;dr even if you have insurance, you can negotiate your hospital bill down a significant percentage. i was successful in getting 30% off my latest bill. thanks, obama.*

i've been futzing with sleep apea for several years (gg gaining 15 pounds in college) and recently decided to ask my primary-care doctor for a referral for a sleep study.

he went through a brief questionnaire with me that ruled out narcolepsy, and boom -- i was scheduled to conduct an in-home sleep study using a machine the hospital provided me. sounded great -- if the test was positive, i'd get a cpap machine free of charge!

what i didn't realize is that the 15 minute appointment to meet with a nurse, who walked me through how to use the machine, would cost exactly $500 after insurance \(hospital/physician services\)(https://imgur.com/a/drgzo). i was barely 10% into my individual annual deductible of $500, so this was going to hurt a lot.

thanks to a post from this person(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5auqdd/reminder_that_you_can_negotiate_your_medical/?st=j95v53cf&sh=3912f619), i decided to call my insurer to get my explanation of benefits explained (eob). once i was satisfied that they were dotting their i's and crossing their t's, i called my hospital to plead my case.

1. my s/o and i are not poor. we are in fact quite privileged and live a comfortable life in the greatest city in america. thanks to good budgeting and a healthy emergency fund, yes we could afford this $500 bill, but it would not be fun. we just welcomed our firstborn child into the world a few weeks ago, and recently purchased a home to boot. 
2. our insurance is actually decent. $500 individual deductible, $1000 family deductible. 100% coverage after either threshold is met. premiums are manageable. 
3. i was stupid and assumed that just because i wasn't meeting with an m.d. in person, i wouldn't be paying more than $100 in hospital/physician services. nope, a neurologist still reviews my test results! duh!

all right, so it's time to call the hospital and plead my case. i dialed the number, entered my account info, and....

**as soon as i explained my situation to the helpful rep from my hospital's financial services department (newborn baby, did not expect such a high bill for a test that i elected to take), i was immediately offered a 30% discount on my $500 bill**. 

i didn't even have to tell them, ""i am only willing to pay $_______"". i was literally quoted an updated figure and told to pay over the phone with a credit card or checking account.

i immediately paid it and thanked the rep for being so helpful. could i have pled for a 50% discount? maybe. but again, my s/o and i have money set aside for unexpected/careless expenditures like this. i should have known better, and i felt it was appropriate to pay at least the majority of my bill.

as for whether i'll be going back for a follow-up test to get my cpap machine.....yeah, we'll see about that.

edit: i should have mentioned earlier, but yes this is a massive ymmv situation. ",11
"by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging. happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

i was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. i noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

normally, i wouldn't think twice about it, but i was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

we pull up to a stop light, and i hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. apparently he didnt see me, because when i said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, i let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

as i turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. the way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

as i'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. it didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

she then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as i'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. the way she viewed it, i was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

the cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

tl;dr i stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

edit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. it was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford f-350",4

"i cheated on my exam in a way i never thought was possible. this was about four years ago in high school. now i am from poland and we had a test of english idioms. i considered myself quite good at english so i never really paid attention to when the exams were scheduled as i managed to get good marks without studying at all.

the idiom one, however, caught me off guard. i knew about two out of ten examples and i just wasn't okay with the mark that i was gonna get. i quickly wrote down the idioms on a separate paper and never handed in the original one. the teacher then proceeded to mark the tests at his desk and that's when i wrote my answers on that separate sheet of paper with the help of my notebook.

as i finished i approached my teacher and asked him some typical questions about my marks and etc. that required him to look at his computer screen. at that very moment i dropped my perfectly written paper under his chair and returned to my own desk. about 15 minutes later i watched him pick it up with slight confusion and eventually he assumed that he had dropped it before, exactly as i had planned.

i ended up getting the best mark and honestly am still proud of myself for handling it like that. i've learned the idioms too.",13

"az discovered a video of my father raping me as a child. throwaway account for obvious reasons. i am a 19 year old male and i was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. i then came across a video of my father raping me. i don't want to go into detail as i am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but i have no idea what to do. i live a relatively normal middle class life and i am just at a loss of words. i have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as i don't want to face my family. the worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.

"when did we loose our humanity. okay so yesterday someone reversed into my car while it was parked at daycare where i was dropping my kid off at, i had just gotten out of the car myself with my kid. the person who reversed into my car pulled over to the side. this person was very clearly shaken. they were trying to hold back tears. 

i myself have been in a similar situation where i accidentally caused damage to someone else's car and i remembered the feeling of guilt so well (it's not something that will ever leave me).

so when this person got out of their car and kept apologising i remained calm and asked them where they okay, they said they were. i also asked was the baby in the car okay, and they replied that the baby was fine. the person kept apologising and shaking. they gave me details on how to contact them. so we both went and dropped the kids off to. while walking back out i noticed this person was still shaking and crying. i comforted them and asked them where they okay to get home, they said they were. 

as the day continued and i was at work something clicked with me that i actually knew who this person was and i was friends with their daughter. i decided to contact their daughter to make sure they were okay, because i couldn't get the worry out of my mind (they had mentioned a health condition when i was reassuring them). the daughter got back to me to tell me that they were still in shock and that they were soo sorry. they also asked about the damage to my car. i told them that i would get it assessed when i left work and let them know. i also told them that i really just wanted to make sure that the person was okay. 

after work i got the damage assessed and the person gave me a number of quotes depending on how they fixed my car... i told them i wanted the cheapest option as this person had been through enough and they didn't need extra financial concerns added to their worries. the repair man seemed shocked when i said this and said ""most people go for the most expensive option and get panels replaced"" now why would i do this when the damage could be repaired for a fraction of the cost baffles me. 

later on i was talking with someone else about what happened and they said ""why aren't you claiming for whiplash"" to which i replied ""well i wasn't even in the car and more importantly it's not true""  they were like ""well i would be saying i was in the car and i have whiplash""...

when did we start going down this path where all we do is claim? why would we make life so awkward for another person? 
can't we all have a bit of humanity and realise that we are human... we make mistakes... accidents happen! don't make life harder for others than it already is! 

disclaimer: i know i'm not perfect and sometimes i do make things harder for others even though i do try my best not to.

"i was raped by my girlfriend. i am a 36-year-old guy and i was raped fifteen years ago by my then-girlfriend, who was 19.

i was 21 and she was the cutest girl probably on campus, and we took half the same classes. i was literally head over heels with her and after a few months, i asked her out and she said yes. we went on two or three dates and i thought i'd found the one. this girl was amazing, she was beautiful, really smart, and fun to be around.

she was driving us back from a restaurant on the fourth date, i think it was, when she stopped the car off on a side road all of a sudden. i looked at her, and she went on top of me. i tried to push her off but she pinned my hands down and started kissing me. i asked her what was up, and she said she was going to ""reward"" me by having sex together for the first time. i tried to say i wasn't really in the mood, it had been a long day and i wanted our first time to be more special but she'd already unbuttoned my pants. i really tried to get her off then but as much as it sucks to admit it, i'm not a very big guy and this girl was strong enough to keep me down. i decided to just let her go on, maybe she'd get tired. after her getting on me, though, i'd had enough.  
""i'm done,"" i told her. but we had already started. her eyes were closed and she went on for about five more minutes before she got off and i sat up and buttoned my pants.  
""you raped me,"" i said, and she laughed out loud. i honestly think she didn't believe she had raped me, because i was a guy and guys always want sex, don't they?  
""you're welcome,"" she said and she put the car into gear as if everything was fine. i let her drive us up back to my dorm which was only a few minutes away and when she tried to follow me, i told her i felt really sick and would catch her later. she scoffed but left and i went upstairs and just lay there all night long, not able to sleep.

i told my roommates the other day what had happened and they both clapped me on the back, telling me ""good job"". i decided i wasn't raped. there's no way a guy could get raped by a girl two years younger than him.  
i tried to forget about it. when she texted me a few days later asking if i wanted to go to this party her friend was throwing, i went, and then before it was over, pulled her aside and broke up with her. i blocked her out and ignored my friends telling me ""she got away"" and i made a huge mistake.  
for fifteen years, i've been telling myself nothing happened to me, i'm not a pu\*\*y, i didn't get raped by a girl.

today i admit it. yeah, i was raped. yeah, she was two years younger than me. yeah, i'm a guy. i don't fucking care. i was raped. i was raped and it's destroyed me, been destroying me since the day it happened.

"for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? my family is derisively calling me ""scott's tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.. edit: for all the people asking, scott's tots is an episode of the the office, the plot is michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. he assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. the episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. i've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of tv ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. i've watched the office 8 times and i skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. parks n' rec is a better show though...fight me. 

so how do i begin with this. i am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. my grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who i call niece because i truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. the condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise i would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. the stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (i really hope this is making sense). basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do i get to keep it long term. 

my cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to university of arizona so she can start next week. either they didn't know or didn't care about the gpa requirement because when i asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. i don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 gpa. i asked her how she got into uofa and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

i basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my grandma's will and that i will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

that's when all hell broke loose. my mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. my sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that i'm running my own version of ""scott's tots"" because i taking away money that was promised for education. there's also an undertone that i'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so i can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

no amount of explanation is helping. i've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can i keep their shares. if they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. no one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and i imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

there is really nothing stopping me from doing it. i write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what i'm doing. 

i have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the scott's tots thing because i don't want to be seen like that. 

would i be the asshole if i withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

"for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when i found out the child wasn't mine?. my ex and i had been together for 2 years.  it was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  i also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually i broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

a few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  she was practically beaming with glee.  i agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  didn't want my child subjected to that.

the one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  she very happily agreed.  her reaction actually washed away some of the fears i had about her possibly cheating on me.  so she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  we find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped i honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

this was a week ago.  she moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  she, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how i'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  that i have plenty of room in my home and i should just help her out.  i feel like i've been through the emotional ringer these past months and i've been though every emotion i am capable of feeling.  from realizing i was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly i feel so emotionally raw and sometimes i agree with them.  that maybe i should take her back and just care for the kid.

was i unfair to this unborn child?  am i a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  she cheated on me, but is this a situation that i should suck it up and take care of them anyway?",3
"by listening to reddit and eating my girlfriends ass, which caused a peanut allergy.. my girlfriend and i have been together for about a year and a half. she is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but i've always told myself that i would never eat ass. i just think it's unsanitary and just gross. but she's dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but i've always deflected it. i decided i might finally give it a try, maybe it won't be so bad. if it's something she would really enjoy it, why not? but then a concerning thought entered my head.

i have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend loves paydays, the peanut candy bars. there is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. i wasn't sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. so i decided to ask reddit.

most of the replies said that it shouldn't be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let's go for it.

she gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. it wasn't quite as bad as i thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. but after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and i could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

i pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her i'd be right back and ran to the bathroom. this obviously made her very self conscience. i was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when i came back i looked like will smith from hitched when he eats the seafood. 

i had to explain to her that i was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. she told me i didn't ever have to do it again, so i guess there's a silver lining to the story.

tldr: i have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.

"by chuckling away being overpaid.. obligatory ""this concluded today"" - i've been working for uncle sam for about 7 years now. i'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day i received a letter from dfas (the guys who actually pay us) that i was overpaid two whole cents.

silly i thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which i could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, the man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - it was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

laughing it off i taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom i work for and why i should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you f-35), and forgot about it. a month later, two weeks ago i get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address xxxxx, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

now i'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before i ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now i'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. being the class a humorous guy that i am, i send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, i kunted et al myself. i lobe me job."" covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

this was a bad play because apparently feds have no sense of humor.

two weeks later, one week ago i got called into my officer's office. not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, i was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

i'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""me, mind explaining to me why i received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, they spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so i thought i'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. patriotism, y'know sir?""

""well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - we need these floors clean for reason and were looking for a class a go-getter to clean them.

"two women changed my life and they don't even know i exist. these two ladies profoundly impacted my life and i will never be able to thank them personally, so i will do it here.

first, to the random teenage girl on the train:

you were talking with your friend. she seemed really depressed because she could not get a boyfriend. i was half listening to the conversation while dozing off and heard you say:

""why do you want a boyfriend so much? what do you think will change in your life after getting a boyfriend?""

that woke me up. at the time, i was obsessing over getting a particular ""dream job"". i was depressed and anxious about it, i was crying over it. i was feeling like such a failure. it was all i could think or talk (and complain) about.

as soon as i got home, i made a list: ""things that i think will change if i get my dream job"".

it ended up being such a long list. i was basically blaming all of life's problems, big and small on not having this particular job. not only that, but i was also putting things ""on hold""' until after i got this job for no good reason. like i needed a particular job title to join a gym or practice my hobby.

so i took that list and started doing everything i wrote down. i started addressing the problems directly and finding outlets for the things i was not satisfied with. i still wanted the job, but my happiness did not depend on it. since then, when i find myself obsessing over a particular thing, i always take the time to think if i'm using it as an excuse to not work on other problems i might have.

thank you, teenage girl on the train. you were trying to help your friend and changed a stranger's life instead.

second, to the woman that lives in an apartment somewhere above me:

you moved to the building shortly after i did. i heard some people move what sounded like a very heavy object up the stairs and you thanking them with such happiness in your voice. and then i heard music. you almost didn't wait for the movers to leave before you started playing that piano. and you kept playing. every day.

every day i heard the piano and i remember thinking ""she plays beautifully, i wish i was that good at my hobby"". and then i felt like an idiot. because i was hearing you play every day while i was wasting time online. so i closed my laptop and got practicing.

i'm trying to build that habit now. sometimes it's hard to find that motivation, sometimes i forget. but every day i hear you play, and every time i stop what i'm doing and practice for a little bit. i'm still not great, but i'm getting better.

thank you, lady who lives in my building. you are just practicing a skill you enjoy and you inspired a stranger to do the same.",12

"lost my temper and told my wife to ""just shut up already, you don't get a say in this"" after her constant inconsiderate nagging. asking for blunt honesty here because i can't deal with this drama right now so just tell me if i've been an asshole and if so i'll go and apologise. 

i'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). my mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. in particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

this women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. they have a long long history of bad blood between each other. both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. obviously i think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

anyway even though i really dislike this women, i have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. she's my father's wife and 2. she was close friends with my mom. my wife was livid at finding out about this and insists i put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

so for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. i keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. i try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and i wont hold it against her. she refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

so a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and i lose my tempter. i tell her (paraphrasing)

""just shut up already. you don't get a day in this. you don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for christs sake. just leave me alone already.""

tonight, i had to call an ambulance to my apartment. my boyfriend was acting erratic and seemed to be in psychosis. he then had a full-on seizure. 

later on, i found out he smoked synthetic marijuana. i don't know much about that. i do not do drugs. i do not even smoke normal marijuana. i called an ambulance because i didn't know what else to do - i was scared. 

three policemen showed up first and entered without knocking. asked where he was. i started to cry and they told me to go in the other room as i was annoying them. i complied. then, the larger of the three cornered me in the hallway.

he said my pupils were completely ""blown"" and i better start telling the truth about what drugs i do. i told him that i have incredibly poor eye sight and my pupils have been naturally large since childhood - this is true. he told me, ""stop fucking lying to me now or you're getting arrested for drug possession."" again, i denied any drug use and told him he could literally drug test me through blood and urine at that exact moment - i am clean. he left me in the hallway and another man came out, rinse and repeat. then the third did the same thing. they kept telling me to look at lights and laughing and saying i was the biggest liar they had ever met. at this point i'm amped up and scared. i am a 23 year old woman. i am in nursing school. i do not do drugs.

at this point, they have the ems there coming or and checking my pupils and laughing. they were telling my boyfriend that he better rat on both of us or we were both going to jail. they ripped apart my whole entire room and starting laying into me for having cipro prescribed (an antibiotic). the largest policeman then told me he was going to speak to my landlord and have me evicted.  i reiterated that i am completely clean and could pass not only a field sobriety test but a drug test of any kind. he retorted with ""i highly doubt that"" as he continued to tear apart my home.

eventually, they got my boyfriend into the ambulance and all three of the cops left laughing. the largest turned around and said, ""congratulation on ruining your life. don't call an ambulance when you are on drugs, i'll see you around"".

not only am i shaken, but i feel threatened and ashamed. the man i was with should not have been on anything, but i called an ambulance because i was scared he might die! i didn't call them to be harassed. did they even do anything really wrong that i can report this? we live in a small town in nepa. i know that they heard a possible drug incident over the scanner and had three of them show up because they thought they'd find a good amount of drugs/an incident of interest. they found absolutely nothing. no one got arrested or charged. they also refused to give me any badge numbers and told me if i kept inquiring i'd be in more trouble.

"(update) bought a ps4 from walmart for christmas and it had books in it. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a98686/bought_a_ps4_from_walmart_box_had_books_in_it_and/

ever since discovering right before christmas that the ps4 spiderman combo my wife purchased for our son had books in it and took it in to get a new one it's been an extremely annoying and stressful time.

i took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""we stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. so i've been back to the same walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. i wasn't yelling, or causing issues i just want the ps4 my wife purchased for our son for christmas. 

so the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""i believe this man has been trying to scam us since christmas eve claiming his ps4 had books in the box"". cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that i've been constantly dealing with and i get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

i again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

so the outcome? no ps4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and i cannot do a chargeback. if you are ever purchasing anything expensive from walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. merry christmas walmart.

"i used to charge a kid a made up ""fat tax"". a long time ago i was a high schooler at a boarding school. i was a decent kid in the eyes of the teachers and school administration. in fact they liked me so much that throughout my time there i was able to rise through the student ranks. i became a prefect, then i became the head boy, and at one point i had passed training that allowed me to run my own sports sessions or event where i was supervising younger and even a few older kids. this was just basic training for first aid, situational awareness, etc. at one point the school had so much trust in me that i was allowed to leave the school premises alone in the afternoons. this was huge and very few students had this privilege.

in typical fashion, as soon as i received the privilege i began abusing my powers as a free man. the school was very adamant on getting us balanced meals so we weren't allowed to get food delivered (all delivery vehicles were refused entrance). having the privilege of leaving the premises meant that i didn't have to order junk food and risk getting caught, i could simply go out to any fast food joint and bring food back with me. 

it all started out as an exclusive club, myself and my friends were munching on mcdonald's and kfc as the plebians were having the filthy healthy cafeteria foods. then i was offered something i couldn't refuse, money. not long after i had built a whole operation for bootlegging junk food into the school. we had cut off times for orders, a priority list for regular customers, extra fees for late orders, and even a spreadsheet for keeping a record of orders, payments, and profits. this smuggling was next level, we were organised, knew all the fire exits, where to walk to avoid corridor cameras, and how to pack the food so that it's unnoticeable when walking in (mostly used sports bags with a thin layer of clothes). the teachers new something was going on, there was food wrappers everywhere but no one knew how it came in. business was booming and i was making profits of 50 dollars a day, for 3-4 days a week. but it wasn't enough, i was hungry for more. there was a fat kid that ordered regularly, so i pulled the most asshole move you could do to your best customer. i started charging 2x the price for his orders and i would hide behind a bullshit moral barrier claiming we were doing this for his own good since we learned in economics that increased prices reduce demand and so he would be eating less and he would lose weight. the kid saw straight through the bs but in the end he couldn't resist it and continued ordering from me.

"as a manager, give praise in public and give discipline in private.. in an old job in ""corporate america"" i had a manager who would always share with employees encouragement and kind words of praise within earshot of other employees, and would offer words of critisicm and suggestions for improvement in private (in his office or a conference room). this set up an environment of positive reinforcement and gave employees respect and honesty they needed to perform at a higher level.

"by leaving a dildo on the table and ruining my sons life. this happened saturday night into sunday morning but my shame has subsided enough for me to write this out. also no throwaway because whatever. 

we have a 12 yr old son. 

saturday night after he went to bed, husband and i decided to get a little sex in. after quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the ""toy"" box. husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (he was putting new batteries in them, etc). he comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. we wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says ""what is that on the table?!""
...i immediately realized the fu. husband did not so he asks ""what is it?"" 
son: a purple banana (ps he's 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
cue immediate shame/laughter. i wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

side note. we did not use that particular ""purple banana"" that night-thank god. 

after we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says ""what do you want for breakfast?"" 
son says ""i lost my appetite"" 

i'm still dying inside. i'm sure son is too.

tl;dr left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won't ever be the same.

edit: ok guys-you realize it's 2019, the internet is alive and well, and 7th grade 12yr old boys are exploring etc right?! it's not crazy that he knows what dildos are.

also edit: i didn't treat it like it was shameful and i know i didn't actually ruin his life. but no one wants to think of their parents having sex. we laughed about it afterwards and made purple banana jokes the rest of the day. we are open and communicate etc. i was mortified and still am, because it's embarrassing.",4
"i sold my body. when i turned 18 i was homeless, so for 6 months i sold body as a prostitute, to get money, to get somewhere to sleep for a night, hell even to get a shower. it was the worst time of my life. i'm a man and as a male you would think wow that's awesome you scored so much. the complete opposite in fact every day i would see myself in the mirror and cry thinking i'm not capable of love, or even getting on my own two feet. i thought to myself i cannot afford some food for the night let alone to fall in love. having sexual experiences with someone you do not love is the most horrible feeling ever. i don't know about anyone else but i feel like i was somehow torturing myself. it was the hardest, most demeaning, most heart reneging thing i have ever done.  

edit: i still have problems with self esteem because of this, so when my gf wants to have sex. i usually have to convince myself that she wants me for me and nothing else. overall an 8 hour process. so i've decided to tell some of my friends who i don't feel will judge me who may not know. i've read so much support and good vibes sent my way. thank you all so much.

"(nyc) i am being harassed by the orthodox jewish ""police"" in my home. this has been going on for almost 2 years since i moved in. i am at my wits end, what can i do to stop it?. **edit2: putting this here since this is locked. thank everyone for all the advice/support. i will be following some of the advice recieved and update once i have one. if this works i'll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what i've been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance i'll have no choice but to move. thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. that has been expecially helpful because it's put my situation into perspective. yeah it sucks but worst case i can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn't the case for people within the community. and even though the nypd has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i've found myself in for what it is. will update when i can.**


*edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home seven times. and this is common.*

i live in brooklyn ny. i purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. i honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

since i moved in though, this has been a huge issue. i don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. i honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. the issue is that they have been using the jewish police to harass me. 
to give you an idea of the shit i am dealing with i'll tell you what prompted this post.  i chose to have a superbowl viewing party today. about 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were five people here) i get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. we were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). my condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people i invited from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. i don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that i have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

i am fucking done. i want this to stop. i have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. i have tried calling the nypd every time they show up. this has not worked. i have complained to my condo association. no help. i have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city and state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and nothing has worked. i keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home that i own with my permission. 

im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. i am just so fed up with this bullshit. i am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a home i own on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

am i crazy here? how is this allowed? what can i do to stop it? ",2
"by sleeping with my landlord. okay so this happened over the weekend and today. 
on friday, i went to view an apartment. i had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. 
so i see the apartment, everything's great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. 

i get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. i'm going to go in on monday to sign the lease. 

okay so now it's saturday night and i'm just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let's call him steve
he messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. 

so monday rolls around and i go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends

i walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. 

the woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve's wife. steve looks totally chill, while i'm freaking outside but trying to remain calm. i did not sign up for this. 

anyway, i feel bad for his wife and i feel like a horrible person even though i had no idea that he was married. 
can't wait to live there for a whole year! 

 
tl;dr 
slept with my landlord without knowing who he was and found out he has a wife.

edit: yall im a guy. sorry, i didn't clarify that in the original. 

edit 2: i was thinking of messaging him on tinder but he unmatched me so. and i don't want to email or text him in case it's a work email/phone and the wife sees the message.

edit 3: wow this blew up what the hell. i'm not going to tell his wife because 1) id like for her to not kick me out of the apt and 2:) as many people have pointed out they could be in an open relationship and i don't want to accuse him of cheating and make things messy or weird.

hello everyone, i said that i'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response i got yesterday. in many ways, i was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but i found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200b;

i spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. he basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. we had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning i went back to the flat and confronted her. she was there (neither i nor her work on saturdays), and i set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner i could.

&#x200b;

 basically, i said that i didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. the wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. she basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". look, i'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. i basically said that over the weekend i'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (i'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but i stood my ground and didn't change my course. not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200b;

i left, and there is nothing much more to say really. as i type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). i'll be grand, being totally frank i feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  the coming days i'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"".

"by looking up my school bully. so a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when i was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. i struggled like hell because i didn't speak a single word of english. the school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while i was there). anyway, i tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. one guy just completely hated my guts from day one. no idea why or what i did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. so that's he kind of person i'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my english in class, in front of the teachers and all. there was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while i was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. i naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. when to leave school and which exist to use. where to sit in class etc. once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. i just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  the only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. i would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. karma has to work right? the world can't be that unfair. 

fast forward 15 years. i haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. i didn't make any friends and i didn't develop stockholm's. i looked him up on facebook. 

he owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. he lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. he is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. this has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and i just can't get over the bullshit i was fed, karma will get him for you. i think karma missed.

"i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him - update. hey! a week ago i posted about the fact that i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and i wasn't sure where to go from there. i was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! i think i was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

the following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. on thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. i was so nervous i thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. he said that he's sorry he wasn't around much the days after but i was like no it's fine i haven't been home either, i knew it wasn't on purpose. the vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said 'like maybe you have a good soul if that's a thing' and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. and then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how i felt and he said 'sorry i'm not trying to make this a big thing i just want to make sure you're okay with everything and i want to make sure you feel respected'. i was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. i said that i was fine and that i felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. he said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we're both happy living together whatever happens. i said i agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

it was all really sweet and nice and i think that whatever happens, he's a respectful guy and we'll communicate and we'll be mindful of each other. at one point while we were talking he did say 'sorry we've gotten off track, but i felt it was important we didn't just discuss what happened, i wanted to get to know you a bit. it was a spontaneous thing so i'm glad you agree that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it, and there's no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. we'll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that's all we can do. and maybe we'll have sex again too if you're also up for that.'

"by letting this subreddit devolve into a collection of creative erotica writing assignments meta. i don't know if meta threads are allowed, but i think this needs to be said. i believe the removal of the ""nsfw only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. the majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting tifus that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, tifus that are actually not tifus at all and serve only as humble brags - by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool i am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.

i elected for the bed.

"i just spent 3 hours with the newly arrived refugees from syria, and they made me cry.. excuse any spelling mistakes, i'm on mobile.

yesterday 78 refugees arrived in my small town in germany. many people have already been talking about how dangerous they will be and women will be disrespected by them and they'll kill us. that type of ignorant bullshit.

my friend went yesterday to the encampment, inside what once was a small shopping center. she said the men were so nice to her and her daughter that she wanted to go again today to see if they needed help with anything else. i asked if i could go as well to help.

we arrived there at around 9:30 and most of the men were still sleeping. i thought it would be rude to take pictures so i didn't get any of the inside... but just imagine a place where the walls are white and inmates are put 4 to a cell in bunk beds, and each ""cell"" was sectioned off with metal fences they use for construction sites, with some white plastic attached to it so the men had privacy from anyone walking in.

my friend had brought cigarette lighters for the men since all of them smoke (except the youngest, 16). the people in charge didn't really know what to do with us, but then i told them my first language is english, and they right away brought us to a syrian doctor who could speak excellent english. 

he told me what the refugees needed and i translated that to the boss running the encampment. at one point some men told him they needed shoes, because theirs were falling apart (literally). we split the people into groups because others wanted to go get groceries, and others wanted to take the bus into town for other stuff. we went with the group to get shoes and jackets.

5 men came with us. they all had thin jackets on and no umbrella,  and it was raining like cats and dogs as we were walking.  they got completely soaked on the way over. i had an umbrella and didn't use it because i felt shitty that i could stay dry and yet they would get soaked. however, one of the guys (a 16 year old) told me in hand gestures that he would hold the umbrella for me, and he held it over us the whole way to the store.  and i'm supposed to believe now that all muslim men disrespect women? no. never again. 

in the store my friend bought them umbrellas, because their money that they had (200 euros for one month) could be spent on better things. she doesn't earn much either, and i thought that was really kind of her to do.

on the way back i was trying to learn some arabic words, and i asked about mama and papa. one guy said his mom and dad are in syria still. then he said brothers, showed me two fingers, and then made a shooting gesture and said is. he said freedom as he showed me the gesture for handcuffs, and said ""gone"". i cried. i looked at him and the brother that is still living (the 16 year old) and i fucking could not stop crying. these poor fucking men. they have nothing but broken shoes and a few clothes, had a third of their family fucking killed by is, and then they get stared at by fucking germans with looks of disgust on their faces. 

i apologized to the two brothers. it made them sad to see me sad,  they said. they called me ""sadiq"", which means friend in arabic, and that touched me. they showed me pictures of their mom and dad and little sister and asked if they could take pictures with me so they could send them to their families. i'm glad that they and their families know there is someone here that wants to help them.

fuck stereotypes. these people want to be happy just like everyone else in this fucking world. and even though i only helped them by showing them where the store was, i hope that they know now that there are people here in germany that want them here. i want these men to be safe, to be able to go back home one day to their families and be fucking happy.

i wish with all my heart that everyone in this world would want the same for everyone else.


edit: i just would like to also say that there are *so* many people in germany who want to help the refugees. just today alone i picked up 10 bags of men's clothes from different people for me to donate to their living place. i mentioned they needed electric kettles to my son's oma, who isn't a fan of refugees, and she offered the two that were in the cellar for me to take. the people here are overall good people, but some buy in to what the media or hate groups say about the refugees. if they'd just take the time to help their minds would be changed. at least, i hope they would be...",12

"for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?. i'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. i've lived there for 6 years. my neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (i actually don't know her first name but i'll call her katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. we exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

so i don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, i don't have as much money for takeout anymore. i'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. i'm gaining weight and i never feel great.

this is where katie comes in. i can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (i know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). i've even complimented it a few times. so i got the idea that i'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or i can pick it up from her!) at night. she's cooking anyway and then i'd have varied presumably delicious food.

i asked her the next time i saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). the next time i saw her a few days later, i asked her if she was sure and upped the amount i was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and i should get a housekeeper if that's what i want. she also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like i was being creepy (i wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). i think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

so, aita?

edit: people keep assuming i'm sexist because i didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. it's not an assumption for me. he and i have lived across from each other for 6 years. the cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and i've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

edit: okay. it is abundantly clear that i was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as i hate to admit it, creepy. my instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, i'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. thanks.",3
"my fiance took my birth control pills and stabbed holes into condoms to try and get me pregnant.. i'm in my late 20s and i got engaged for my fiance (29) who i've been with for 9 years. our relationship has never really been tested and we get on really well. but recently he brought up that he wants kids. i said no i'm not ready and probably won't be for a few years. he got really mad and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes. i just moved on from it and didn't give it a second thought. 

a week later i couldn't find my birth control pills, they are usually in the bathroom cupboard but i couldn't find them anywhere. later that night he wanted to have sex, i said i couldn't find my bc pills and he said it's alright he'll use a condom, i supposed that was alright so he went and got one from the bathroom. for the next few weeks we just used a condom and i didn't take the pill. in hindsight i should have got more when i couldn't find the original pack but i couldn't be bothered (my fault) 

on a few occasions we were having sex i noticed the condom was split, he clearly noticed all times and didn't say anything so i said stop. the next day i was putting the recycling in the trash, as i was putting it in i seen my pills at the bottom. i instantly knew he had binned them. he knows i deal with the trash so why we he be so stupid to just put them in recycling. 

it all made sense so i confronted him about the pills and condoms and he couldn't answer me. he just kept walking away. i was so mad at him, it's not right. you can't just force someone to be pregnant just because you want a baby. does he have to carry it for 9 months? 

i haven't been talking to him, i'm so annoyed. ",7
"by falling asleep then waking up while my roommate bought his date back.. this happened many years ago! but it still an experience that brings a few laughs. (tl:dr at the bottom)

back in college, i shared a room with a 4'9 dude and he was nice man. he would always leave everything spotless, he was an amazing wingman and he always managed to make sure that when we had a few people over that they'd all have food readily available and drinks etc. he was so cool. anyway, he told me he was going to have a date and asked if i'd be going to my friends house for the night (he didn't live too far and i had been talking about meeting him one of the days) i was like ""yeah maybe, ohhh i see you want the room tonight i got you don't worry"". so he's all nervous about his date and i give him a pep talk i said ""you're a good man, your dates gonna be great and you definitely look ace!"" he was all hyped up and left. 

i called my buddy and asked if he was at home, he was actually at work. but, he told me he'll be back home within a couple hours or so. now, my roommate who was on his date told me he would ring or text me to let me know he got back safe to the room and to give me the heads up when to leave. 

so, i figured i got plenty of time. i laid on the bed and basically waited for two hours to go by to get a phone call from my buddy to tell me he had finished work. but, i instead get a text message from him saying he had finished work and that he'll be getting home a lot later than expected. still no sign from my roommate on his date though (who said he'll ring/message me if he's bringing his date back)

then *i ended up falling asleep*

again after waiting for my buddy to message me when he's free to meet. after some time passes i begin to wake up a little because i hear some distorted voices, giggling and bed creaking . i'm like ""oh fuck"" he's with his date, him and her are gonna be pissed if i ruin their night now by waking up, ""why didn't he text me or ring?!!"". so, i stayed stationary and pretended to be asleep. i hear them both get outta bed and lay on the floor (i imagine cause of the bed creaking). i then start to hear the almighty thunderous clapping of balls and i'm seriously trying to hold my laughter in _but_ then i i heard moaning like a japanese anime character.. which confused me. anyway at this point i'm still trying to hold my laughter in, i realised i had knocked my phone near the edge of the bed because of my inability to keep my composure, so i decided to try and grab it splinter cell lock picking style. i grab the phone without being noticed and in that moment curiosity got the better of me. the ball slamming stopped and it went quiet so i decided then take a slight peak to see if him and his date was asleep and if the coast was clear.. *nope!* as i opened my eye all i see is a 6'7, huge bald black dude followed by the deepest male voice i've ever heard in my entire life say ""now say you want more now"" and continue the almighty thunderous ball slamming i see my 4'9 roommate getting absolutely destroyed up and down like a goddamn yo yo waving his arms in the sky like when you was a kid and needed a piss but you was in class and you had to raise your hand impatiently to get the teachers attention to go to the bathroom. i again stayed stationary as possible with tears of laughter running down my eyes. all the business stopped and the behemoth of a man left the dorm and my roommate just went straight to bed humming. 

the next day i got up early, showered and decided to get mcdonalds breakfast for myself and my roommate and a strong coffee (believe me, even i felt exhausted after all of that). i come back to the room to see my roommate watching tv as if nothing happened whatsoever. i said ""well tell me about the date? was she nice?"" whilst he grinned and ate his sausage mcmuffin. he just looked at me and said ""it was so much fun we're going to meet again very soon"". 

now, i didn't want to say anything because his sexuality is his business and he'll say when the time was right (he did a month later). so, i said ""i'm glad you had a good time"". as i leave the room and make my way down the hallway, what do i see?? the behemoth black dude walking down hallway with the look of a man on a mission, literally like terminator as he walks through the hallway of the psychiatric hospital. i took a last glance through the window while the dude made his way to my room. so, when my friend said ""we're going to meet again _soon_"" little did i know it would be less than 10 hours from the other night. but at least this time they had all the privacy they wanted and i didn't have to almost die of laughter. 

tl;dr - roommate went on a date, brought back home his date, didn't know his date was another dude, i fell asleep and eventually woke up to see him getting destroyed by a dude the size of bob sapp(https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/071/282/bobsapp_crop_north.jpg?1357083029&amp;w=630&amp;h=420) who came back less than 10 hours later for round two. and i'm 99% certain he ate my mcdonalds hashbrown that i left on the side.

"i managed to convince an entire park that i'm deaf.. i was playing basketball at my local park by myself when a group  gentlemen walked up to me and began asking me for ""nics"" or if i had any ""nics"" (later found out it was short for nicotine or cigarettes) not knowing what that was and not wanting to bother asking what it was, i for whatever reason blurted out ""i'm deaf i can't hear you"" whilst talking like a deaf person and pointing at my ear. what can i say, i just didn't wanna talk to them. for the rest of my time there that day more people began showing up, and every time they stepped onto the court the gentlemen from earlier would inform them i was deaf and i wouldn't be able to hear them. i figured i'm already in this deep i my as well keep going. so for the rest of the day i was the deaf guy playing basketball, talking like a weirdo, and making bullshit hand signals pretending not to hear anyone. even took a few balls to the face because i ""couldn't hear"" them saying ""look out!"" 

i left the park that day thinking that was a one time thing and i wouldn't ever have to do it again. however i go to the park quite often and apparently so does everyone else from day one. and every time i'm there they tell a new group of people and the cycle repeats itself. and i guess with my bullshit sign language i've sold it quite well because to some of the park staff, regular basketball players, and a few miscellaneous individuals think i'm just that deaf guy that goes to the park. even though my hearing is fine. 

i know it's only a matter of time until someone calls out my fake voice, bullshit sign language, or i slip up. but until then i'm kinda just stuck being this deaf dude because i'm too embarrassed to tell the truth at this point. 

update: i've continued going to the park every day, a few of the guys that i have become friends with and that have been very respectful of my disability asked if we could exchange numbers just to hang out some time. so far we've hung out 3 times. went to couple of baseball games and out to eat. and one even invited me to his wedding in january. i also no longer fear running into another deaf person as they may give me away. this is because in order to keep this up i'm proud to say i've extensively expanded my asl knowledge, and can string full real sentences that are no longer made up gestures. so i don't really know how much longer i'll do this, maybe even forever. perhaps this friend group will always know me as the deaf guy that goes to the park every day. and although i feel like an asshole for lying to people who i truly consider friends for so long, i think i'll embrace the good that came of all this and keep on signing.

"lpt tips: what you should never to bring to a dry cleaners. i owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. i know the whole process. i'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.

edit: disclaimer: my experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of all dry cleaners so take that into consideration.

down jackets -  down items are expensive. it could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. down items are not pressed. you could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processing

comforters - never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says ""dry-clean only.""  dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. if your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. you're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.

spot-clean only dresses - many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. some formal dresses are ""spot-clean only"", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  it might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. they may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.

wedding dresses - wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, never opt for the preservation box. dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners do not press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. by the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  so you're paying more money for the dress without the pressing. you get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.

leather: leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. so you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. also, there is no special leather dry cleaning method. leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. you're essentially just paying for the labor charge. to save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.

&#x200b;

worth it:

men's button-up shirts - men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, they're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.

wool peacoats - wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.

d/c only items - suits, silk shirts, cashmere sweaters, etc.

oil/grease spill - dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. if you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. it's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.

also want to add the benefit of opting for""press only.""  baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. they are laundered. however they do look nice when pressed. so you could save money by washing items like jerseys and polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for ""press only"" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.

bottom-line: to get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.  if your item cannot be pressed, you are often paying more for an item you could be doing yourself.",9

"i framed my mother's ex husband when i was 5. so, for a little background, my moms ex husband was a jerk. later on in life, i found out that he was even worse than i thought, but even to 5 year old me, he was a jerk. for example, there was one summer that he spent all of our money (meaning his and the money from the three jobs my mom worked at the time) on cigarettes and booze and other dumb shit, leading to me and my sister having to spend the summer at my grandmother's because there was literally no food in the house and my mom had to live off of bread and butter for about 3 months. he was that kind of guy. 

so, when i was a kid, i always got up much much earlier than everyone else. i can't remember why, but it was probably just so i could watch cartoons in peace. one morning, i went into the living room to find this dudes pocket knife on the couch. it was closed, but i got curious. 

i opened it and i was playing with it, when i had a thought. obviously i can't remember the actual train of thought, but it led to me deciding to cut my hand, right in the center of my palm, so that mom would be mad at meat-head-mcdonald. i immediately started bleeding, and a lot. (now, i know that i bled so much bc i have a blood clotting disorder, yay me) i started screaming, mom came down the stairs along with dick-wipe, and they saw what happened. 

i told mom that he had left the knife open on the couch arm, and i had put my hand down on it on accident. this led to one of their biggest fights, with mom saying that he was endangering me, and micro-penis saying he swore he didn't leave it open.

we spoke via text and then i called her at lunch. it escalated where i was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that i should trust her.

i stated they can be friends, but i expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something i'm comfortable with, and i try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because i know better.

i expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

she doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200b;

i don't think she cheated. i know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. some men are okay with that, i'm evidently not.

"when i was 19 years old i lied about having a summer job and smoked weed at a parking lot 3 days a week for 8 hours a day.. at first, my apologies in advance for any grammar mistakes, english is my second language. 

so, i grew up with very kind and sweet parents. we are a wealthy family but the one thing my parents are obsessed about is working, their whole life is just about work. and in my teen years i was the most lazy person ever, never did anything, school was way too easy everything just went well my whole life without effort. 

when i turned 19 and it was summer, the perfect moment to just relax, smoke weed and drink beers with my friends. but no. my parents insisted that i should get a summer job, probably because they were just annoyed by me doing nothing. so, i did what they said and applied for a job at a local restaurant as pizza delivery guy. the owner was a total jerk and insulted me all the time, after 3 days my shift was over and i never came back. told my parents about the situation and of course they were not happy.

2 weeks passed and i still haven't got a job and they began to annoy the frick out of me, they didn't care about anything else then me getting a fricking summer job. finally i came to the decision to just lie about having a job at a storage facility. they were so happy for me so i just continued the lie. 

i went off for work, drove my car to the train station and put my car in the parking lot and just smoked weed, listen to the radio and watched some movies i downloaded on my laptop. i told my parents my boss paid me in cash every month, i had a student loan at that time my parents didn't knew about, since i was 18+ that is allowed in my country without my parents consent, and that was exactly the right amount of money i would get for those hours i went ""working"" for.

"i'm 25, i hate my corporate desk job, and i have about 30,000 saved up. what can i do investment wise to get out of this while i'm still young?. as the title states i'm getting really unhappy at my current job. i don't have any debt minus my car note (have about $12,000 left which i intend to pay off in 24 months). my monthly expenses come out to about \~$1100 with rent/bills. i'm in a position where my job is draining the life out of me and i'm losing the energy and charisma i used to have. i do intend on speaking with a financial advisor but i would greatly appreciate any help because i'm honestly afraid of slowly becoming too depressed and unmotivated to do anything about it. i also can't deal with interest due to religious constraints so unfortunately i understand that it limits my options somewhat. i truly appreciate any advice that anyone can offer. i'm just in a position in my life where i want to make a change to be happy once more. thank you everyone.

"by closely following a woman around a lingerie store. this happened just today. i (male) was in a lingerie store with my girlfriend, she was shopping for new underwear and i was just following her around, bored as always, staring at my phone to keep myself occupied.

after about 5-10 minutes a man grabs my arm, i turn and it's the security guard. he asks me to leave and starts escorting me towards the exit. i'm confused about what's happening and look around for my girlfriend, who i can't find.

apparently at some point, while not paying attention to anything other than my phone, i'd stopped following my girlfriend (who was wearing a white cardigan and black trousers) and instead had started following some other random woman who was wearing similar clothes. i'd apparently been doing this for at least a few minutes, silently standing closely behind her as she browsed underwear and following her to do it again as she tried to move away. she'd alerted a member of staff with a horrified look towards them.

i put on an outfit i haven't worn in years, and i felt so good about myself walking through the city listening to music on my phone. it was like i could all of a sudden see everything i've been missing for the last 5 years. i saw beauty in the trees on the side of the road, seeing kids playing at a park made me genuinely happy, the weather was gorgeous. everything felt wonderful.

i put fresh strings on my guitar and played it for the first time in months. it felt so nice to finally be able to feel joy from something that i used to love.

i just finished watching some favourite movies of mine and i'm sitting here browsing reddit and my guinea pig is eating lettuce next to me.

"for being cold to my ex-fiance and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?. so, right now i'm in kinda a shitty situation. i've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. all of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but i don't feel that way, heres the story.

i knew my ex for almost 10 years. we go back all the way to high school and have been friends. after we graduated i said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. we dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. i won't lie, i loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. she, however, seemed super worried. i sat down and talked with her about it. i told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

these past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.

suffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not said a single word to her. i have pretty much told her that i want her out of my life. i also demanded a dna test the minute the child is born. if it is mine, i'll help her support it. if not, then i am never seeing her again.

i've been cold to her. her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but i've refused any contact with them. at one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and i kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. any time she's tried to ""reconcile"" i've shut it down,

my friends are saying i'm in wrong here. according to them she's pregnant and because of that i should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. i disagree fully. but i could be wrong. am i letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",3

"i used to eat my coworkers apple chips at work, then tell him that i was allergic to apples so he wouldn't accuse me.. just to be clear, this wasn't because i was particularly hungry, its because my coworker was an absolute asshole. he was really creepy toward the girls in the office and always said some pretty weirdly racist shit to our other coworker who was from mexico. he was just a crude, horribly annoying person who seemingly took enjoyment out of making everyone around him uncomfortable. he was like a mix of todd packer from the office and tony soprano. he always brought these apple chips into work to eat for lunch, and occasionally i would go in, take the apple chips, and go to the nearby park and eat them for lunch. he would go around asking everyone if they took the chips and would act all pissed off because he knew someone took them. 

instead of just flat out telling him i'm allergic to apples, i put on a little show. he was eating his chips 2 days before i started to take them, and i asked if i could have one, and i took one and almost took a bite, then said ""these aren't apple flavored are they?"" and he said they were, then i quickly put it back on the plate and went to go wash my hands and i said i was allergic. much more believable than me just flat out telling him.

"i stole a book from the library page by page, then glued the pieces together at home. i was about 10 and i was addicted to read encyclopedias. i could spend hours learning about all sorts of stuff, staring at the illustrations and photos, and of course, smelling the books. however, i could get my fix at my local library only as my parents could barely afford food for us, let alone buying fancy books. so, i became a regular guest at the kids/teenager section of the library.

one day i couldn't get there in time, so i only had about half an hour to spend before closing time. not just that, but they also had a brand new, 400 page encyclopedia waiting for me on the shelf. it was love on the first sight. i felt awful, because i knew that i couldn't do much reading in such a little time, and then there was this lovely smelling book with a montage of astronauts, cars and magnificent landscapes on the front cover just begging me to read it. sadly, books like those were not borrowable and time was ticking.

i thought about 'taking it', but it was just enormous and i wasn't. i wasn't a bad boy either, i told myself. but what if i just take a few pages? that surely won't hurt anyone, and noone will notice it missing. that's what i did. the book was binded in a way, that i could carefully rip about 5 pages out in one go. i wrapped the pages around my foot, slipped them in my socks, covered my socks with my pants and i just casually walked out. the first time i actually said 'thank you very much' with a big smile to the librarian and she gave me that awkward 'what the heck are you talking about?' look. my 10 years old mind quickly realised how stupid i was to say that and i, maybe even my parents could be in jail for this, so i just rushed out, sweating and with my heart jumping out of my chest.

originally i wanted to return the pages at the next visit to the library. but as i was sitting on my bed at home, reading about the wildlife in africa (the only content i got at the time), i came up with the masterplan of repeating the process until i get every page. and the plan was working! not just that, but i improved on the technique. i wrapped pages around my feet, around my arms (had to wear long sleeve for that) and also kept a stack on my back, tucked carefully in my pants. i could get about 20-25 pages in just one day. i remember walking slowly like a robot on my way out as i didn't want to crush the pages too much. i couldn't bend in any direction because the pages were holding my limbs tight.

after several visits to the library the encyclopedia began to visibly shrink. so i got some paper from the photocopy room and replaced the missing pages with blank ones. my last visit was the sketchiest, because i had to take the trophy somehow. by trophy i mean the hard cover with the astronauts on. there was no way to wrap it like i did with the pages and it was too big to hide it anywhere on me. but i was so close to victory, i couldn't let it go. i had the shiny cover in its full glory, in my hand. i put it under my t-shirt, on my back. hands in my pocket, trying to hold the cover with my elbows. i was scared to the bone that they will catch me and send me to jail. i checked my reflection in the window. i looked like a terrified lady gaga with fake shoulderpads. but i was also shameless by this time, i knew i was an awful person. it was nearly 5 o'clock and every librarygoer left, the librarians were doing their closing up routines so the front desk was abandoned. i just walked out without anyone noticing me.

i glued all the pages and the cover together at home. the book was nowhere near as majestic as before, but i loved it anyway. i have never ever stolen anything else in my life, and i am so sorry for this.",13
"i experienced my first kiss last night. i'm a 19 year old male who went on a date last night. this is the first time i've hung out with this girl outside of work. we basically spent the whole date talking and getting to know each other. the last 15 minutes were the highlight though. we were sitting in my car listening to music and we started to share really personal stuff with each other to which i brought up the fact that i've never kissed a girl. she originally thought i was kidding but i reassured her i wasn't. she wrapped her arms around my arm and rested her head on my shoulder saying she didn't want to go home yet. i was terrified, i didn't know if i should make a move but i knew deep down i would hate myself if i didn't at least try. i asked if i could kiss her, she sat up and asked if i really wanted her to be my first kiss. she was surprised but in a good way. i said i was positive. we kinda stared at each other for a minute and then i just went for it, i leaned in and kissed her for about 3 or 4 seconds. she smiled afterwards and then went back to laying her head on my shoulder with one arm wrapped around my arm while she held my hand with the other. some of the best 15 minutes of my life.

"a year ago i relapsed on heroin and recovered. i never told my wife or kids.. i have a wife and 2 kids, aged 14 and 11. i was a heroin addict from 16 years old to 23 years old, which was when my first son was born. my wife helped me get sober, and remains an amazing person and wife overall. 

&#x200b;

last year, my wife had surgery and got pain pills. i don't know what the fuck came over me, but i just wanted to try one to remember how good opiates feel. i was thinking, it wasnt heroin right? so maybe i wont relapse? i cant even describe how stupid of a decision it was. i wasn't depressed, or particularly yearning for heroin, but i just wanted to try it. literally right away it felt so unbelievably amazing that i took 2 more the next day. on day 3 i took about 4-5, i was high the entire day, feeling absolutely amazing. by day 5, i went to one of the local dealers and got heroin. literally only took me 5 days to get back on heroin. 

&#x200b;

my wife never got a hint. my kids never suspected anything. i was lucky this happened while my wife was recovering from her surgery, she was bed ridden most of the day so i was mostly free to do what i want. i didn't inject, i just snorted. i did it every single day for 2 weeks. the only suspicion was my daughter saying i was acting weird when i was high and when my son went downstairs at night and i was mumbling because i was nodding out. he just assumed i was tired. 

&#x200b;

i knew i had to do something. i wanted to just leave, run away to new mexico or something and just do heroin the entire time, then maybe come back. at the time it was literally all i wanted, i kept making these horrible, immoral excuses for my usage. like oh, my kids are old enough, and my wife is a good mom, they dont even need me! i can just run away and do heroin on an island forever. that was the kind of shit i would think. i knew it was bullshit, but its so damn powerful. 

&#x200b;

i ended up quitting. i just sort of forced myself to stop, which previously when i was a teen seemed impossible, but now it feels like i have more to live for. its been a whole year since then. i remember because my wifes surgery was the day before the 4th of july.",13

"obgyn will not stop calling my dad to confirm appointments, even though i'm 22 (. (using a throwaway in case my dad reddits, would prefer him not to find my account)

in indiana

i'm in grad school, but still go to the same obgyn in my home town, out of familiarity and convenience. i was planning to switch once i finished school and settled down. i have him listed as my emergency contact. 

for some reason, they keep calling him to confirm my appointments, despite me telling them three times to never call that number and to please call my cell phone instead. things came to a head yesterday when they called to confirm my appointment for an ultrasound and he cancelled it without my knowledge.  

(my father and i have a tenuous relationship, but that's not related to this situation. i will also be switching docs asap)

this has to be a hipaa violation, right? i can't imagine they're not doing the same thing to other women. this could get someone seriously hurt, if they were seeking birth control or anything behind the back of an abusive parent/spouse.

"by making a grown man cry at my work. i debated whether or not this belongs here cause it's more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. but my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

sidenote: this happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

i work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. i had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. he was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes i get who tend to speak down to me just because i'm a girl who works in a hardware store. anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so i said i could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. he agrees and he opens his wallet and i notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. trying to make conversation i decide to comment on it:
(op: me | og: old guy)

op: oh is that your granddaughter? she's so cute!

og: oh no... that's my daughter.

*fuck, i basically just implied this guy was old.*

og: oh cool! she's really cute! what grade is she in?

*guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

og: she's dead. she was hit by a car. a week after the picture was taken 

in my mind i fucking panicked. i literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. and this is what i came up with:

op: oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! it's too bad she died!

the guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. in record time i get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""have a nice day!"" and he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

guys. 

i told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

and that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" that's what my fucking brain came up with. 
fml.

tl;dr - subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**update: holy shit.**

i did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

to answer a few comments: 
*why didn't you just say 'i'm sorry' and move on?*

because that would of been the smart thing to say and as i have referenced, i am a complete and utter dumbass. also, i am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so i was trying to backpeddle as fast as i could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*why would you comment on the kids picture? that's weird.*

yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. but like i said i am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. this happened when i was still pretty new to the job and i had never worked in retail before so i wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. after this happened i learned my lesson and i have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*why do you work in customer service? you clearly don't belong in that department.*

like i said this happened a few years ago when i was still pretty new and i have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. i now train people for the job and i am also a assistant supervisor of the department. i usually tell newbies this story when i am training them so they don't make the same mistake as i did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*did you ever apologize to the guy?*

no, and that's the one thing i regret most of all. i've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. i truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. while i'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

"(update 2) my roommate's (21f) parents keep letting themselves into my (21f) apartment with the spare key she gave them.. okay guys, i'm sorry for updating you guys late and for the super long post, but i want to make sure i get important details in there.

tldr: my family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

i think rm is crazy and needs a mh checkup. seriously. i am very worried for her wellbeing. 

my mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. i told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. my mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

when my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. i've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
my mom called rm and rd and r to come over to talk. they came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. she made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and i could tell this was pissing rm off. some points of the confrontation:

1. why are you calling my daughter these names?
rm: i didn't say anything. she's making        up lies. 

2. why are you even in the apartment that much? you told us that you go there once a month to check on r. you also said she visits you every weekend?
rm: the kids don't know how to cook, so i help. also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. why are you going through my daughter's stuff? why does she need a lock? why are you limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*i shall also mention that roommate's dad was sitting in their car on the driveway during this whole confrontation*

but things got heated up really quickly. rm started insulting my parents:

- she said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said i am unruly and that the clothes i wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). this annoyed my brother, and he showed rm ig pictures of r wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. rm shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- she then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""god complexes"". this pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" this pushed rm off the edge, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted to slap him. 

this lady tried to slap my 24 y/o brother in front of my parents. 

they argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. this time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. she came back to where we were standing and literally threw the dress in my face.

my mom had no more patience left, and back slapped rm across her face. i've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and i burst out laughing. even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of rm. rm started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

when they left we had a big discussion:

my parents were angry that i never told them about this before. they said that they got me that apartment so i could do what i wanted. they wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
however, they are very proud and happy with the way i dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. thank you all for the advice. i appreciate it alot. ❤

they were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of r cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

my parents agreed that letting r live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. my parent's started the eviction process today. 

anyways, it may be hard to believe, but i do stand up for myself a lot. it's just that in this situation, i didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because i had respect for their friendship and i didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. i learned from this, and i have growing up to do, but now that i know i have support, i won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

i also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't indian). no one is living rent free in this situation. 

i would also like to say that even though i wasn't friends with r in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

also my parents are liberal ass indians. they have lived here in america for over 40 years. they didn't want to spy on me at all. they don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

edit 1: i forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, i don't think it does. i'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. also, it's my parent's money. they'll do what they want. this gives me no excuse to have a gpa less than a 4.0, js. 

edit 2: i took out the part where rm tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  it was funny though. 

edit 3: i added a tldr. 

i included most of the important points. if something doesn't make sense i'll reply in the comments. 

the cops are yet to show up. 

edit 4: guys we forgot to ask for the key back. fucking damn itttt

"by unknowingly doping for the entire school year. this has been in the making since last september. this is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

late last summer i started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. i'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

though i've always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call i needed to start working out. beside hitting the gym, i also joined a sharpshooting club, and was i was natural at it. over the course of a few months i moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. my aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

i'm pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but i sure as hell didn't. in the meantime a cardiologist said ""tough shit"" and bumped up the meds.

during the course of this school year i was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. the stakes were high, but i was a stone cold shooter. later that day checking out my fitbit, i found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when i had to bicycle over the the range.

flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. my friend jokingly mentioned that i must've been doping to do so well and the dots connected. i googled ""metoprolol doping"", there it was. i still haven't told anyone, but reddit. what the hell do i do now?

tl:dr started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug.",4

"donating organs after death should be the standard, not even mandatory literally normal procedure. just like refusing to call an ambulance when someone is in need is a crime, refusing to give organs because your family members want your body to keep them should be a crime as well

there's people dying from lack of organs and saying ""no i want my son to not donate"" is walking in the hospital room with the dying guy and his family and saying ""no i'd rather let you fucking die ape""

my sister's father died 'cause the parents of his only potential heart donor were religious and said ""nope you can't go to heaven without all your organs so yea he can die i want to go to heaven duh"", how much i hope their cause of death implies losing an organ and be conscious long enough to realize they're not going to heaven

"3 tricks car salesmen use to take your money. how to overcome 3 tricks car salesmen use to take your money.  

 
purchasing a vehicle from a dealership can be an anxiety inducing experience.  what i discovered was that the number one emotion women felt when considering buying a vehicle was anxiety followed by uncertainty.  in this article we will review 3 tricks that dealers and car salesman use that cause this anxiety and uncertainty.  i will teach you how to overcome these feelings, and become immune to the tricks. 

 the worst thing that can happen to us as consumers is purchasing something and quickly regretting it.  this is called buyer's remorse and it is a terrible feeling.  why? well you just spent $20,000 and you are married to a monthly payment for 3-6 years. i do not want this happen to you!  the following tips are designed to prevent you from being pushed around by the salesman and to ease your mind of worries in regards to overpaying.
 
#1 ~ emotional manipulation

during my car salesman days, we were taught many subliminal tactics to get customers interested in vehicles.  one is emotional manipulation.  the reason salesmen often insist on test driving is to get you to create a sense of ownership in your mind.  ""ma'am take a seat, adjust the mirrors, now adjust the seat until you are comfortable .  go ahead and turn on your favorite radio station and flip back the sunroof.""  is your heart beating faster and you excitement increasing?  you are unknowingly getting excited and your mind is taking mental ownership of this nice new vehicle.  that awesome new car smell isn't helping either is it?  that feeling of euphoria is a very human response.  they are counting on you to feel this way. 

what happens next is quite primitive.  as our excitement builds, the emotional part of our brains begins to take over. when this happens, we are much more likely to make a choice based on emotions.  have you ever heard of dogs that go crazy and get scared during lightning and thunder storms?  i had an adorable shizu dog that would run miles away when thunder rumbled the house. rip bootsy.  during these storms the logical part of his brain would turn off and the emotional part would take over.  in this case fear dictated my dog's behaviors.  much like my old boy bootsy (my mom named him btw), this happens to us when we take mental ownership of a new car.  the budget we set and the price we wanted are now more likely to be negotiable.      

**how to overcome trick #1 ""emotional manipulation""**

be mindful of your emotions.  simply being aware of this tactic beforehand and how our mind/bodies will respond is a half of the battle in not making a poor emotional based decision.  i always recommend that we sleep on it.  my rule of thumb is to never make a large purchase the same day.  this isn't the same as picking up a snickers while in the checkout line. this is a 5 figure purchase that we will be married to for the next 3-6  years. be smart, go home, sleep, and revisit it the next day when your mind has had a chance to tend to other matters.   
 
#2 ~ pushing you towards payments

after the test drive we will be directed to go inside, sit down, fill out our contact information, and discuss the price.  car salesmen are taught to negotiate the payment with us instead of the price of the vehicle.  this has two benefits for them.  1) making an affordable payment is relatable and gets your mind off of the actual price.  we end up paying more this way. (see ex1 at the end for a math based scenario) 2) the interest rate and the length of the loan can quickly fall into the background with this payment focused presentation.  the payments method works because we are more likely to digest the affordability of a a monthly payments versus the 5 figure sticker price.  over six years, a $100 dollar increase is not that much, but by doing the math it will add on $6k to the total price - wow, that's mind-blowing!  see below how customer 1 saved $4,200 by focusing on a $70 lower payment.  this is worth repeating...a $70 monthly difference saved $4,200!!! 




**how to overcome #2 ""pushing you towards payments""**

tell the salesman up front ""i am not interested in going over payments right now, let's stick to the price of the car out the door.""  you must be proactive here.  a skilled salesman may even give you a rebuttal of ""well ma'am, i just want to make sure you get something that is affordable and fits your budget"".  just smile at your new adversary and politely say ""while i appreciate your concern, i have all of that figured out, please just get me the out the door price"".  (make eye contact and smile for added value and enjoyment). they will get the picture.  you want the individual price of the car and that is what you want to negotiate.  you have now become a formidable opponent.  you have now indirectly saved yourself hundreds if not thousands of dollars by directing the negotiations down this road.  (see ex1 at the bottom for a math based scenario on why this works)   also, the out the door price is the price of the car plus all of the fees that the dealer adds on.  better to know sooner than later what fluff fees the dealers will add.   

#3 ~ the finance office

after a price has been agreed upon, we are sent into the finance office.  here you meet the finance manager.  this person finishes your paperwork, gets you financed (or takes your check), and offers you products to protect your new vehicle.  this is where even the toughest buyers lose.  why? they lose because their guard is down.  when we agree upon a price, we get a handshake and a congratulations.  usually the sales manager gets in on this as well.   you give out a big sigh of relief.  in my sales days, i will never forget this one customer who was an excellent negotiator. he knew what he was doing and worked us down to a super low profit.  he clearly was prepared and this resulted in the dealership making around $100 on the car (nice job!). what happened next really opened my eyes.  he ended up paying $4500 on the warranty and gap products as well as accepting an interest rate 2% higher than he should have. (explanation of these products below in example 3)  all of the money he had just spent his energy and time saving was washed away in the finance office.  customers let their guard down when a price has been reached with the salesman.  don't let this happen to you.  being aware of yourself and the situation is half the battle.
  
i want you to know the background of the finance managers and how they get that job.  it's not by going to business school and majoring in finance.  they get there because at some point they were the top car salesman in the dealership selling 20+ cars a month.  that is part of the car sales business ladder.  it takes a different set of skills since they are selling an intangible product.  you can't put your hands on a warranty or an interest rate. therefore it takes a higher degree of sales skills to be successful here.  they are the best at what they do and that is why they get paid the big bucks. 

the first move when we enter the finance office is to make us feel comfortable.  let's nott let his smile and firm handshake fool us.  he has one clear goal.  convince us to buy what he has.  he doesn't make as much money otherwise.  he will once again show us the new payments if we were to purchase products a, b, or c.  they make money in 2 ways.  the first is by increasing the interest rate we are charged.  they borrow your loan money from bank a for 3% and charge you 4%.  the dealership gets a part of that and the finance manager gets around $500 per % point he charges us.  see ex 2 to see how a 1% increase can cost you well over $500.   the second way they make money is by selling us the company warranty or gap products which can vary drastically. 
 
**how to overcome #3 ""the finance office""**

as before, we want to ask for the total price of the product we are interested in.  it really is a personal preference whether you want any of these or not. i personally have and never will get any of them even if they do add free oil changes.  don't let my stance deter you though because there are some amazing packages out there that add free oil changes for years.  be ready to pay a little extra than you would normally though.  the convenience is worth it for some.  (see example 3 below for more information on products and how to get the best deals.)  next if not already done, we want to clarify what the interest rate is. 
 
good luck!  i hope that this information will allow you to walk into a dealership with confidence.  i hope this was helpful for you and will aid you in saving hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on your next purchase.   
 
 
**example1**

 we are purchasing a $25,000 car.  let's say we go in wanting to pay $22,000. 
the salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of $460 or $391. ""which one works better for you sir?""  do you see what he did there?  he changed your $3000 price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from his two options.  many people lose here. they say they like one of the payments and lose or they say they negotiate and say they want to be at $350 a month.  the salesman takes your $350 request to his sales manager, they come back at $360 (they always come back higher).  great. car is sold.  let's do the math though.  you wanted to be at $22,000.  by accepting $360 you just paid $23,000 for that vehicle and you have no idea what the interest rate is.  the lesson here: keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first.  when that is settled then work on payments. 
 
**example 2**

a $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 4% ~ you will pay $25,920 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
a $23,000 car loan for 72 months at 3% ~ you will pay $25,200 over the life of the loan assuming you pay 72 normal payments
that is a difference of $720
know your local credit union or banks rates before you finance a vehicle. 
 
**example 3**

be familiar with the products before you go into the finance office.
 
gap insurance:  http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/car-gap-insurance-is-it-right-for-you.aspx
extended warranty: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/04/extended-warranties-for-cars-are-an-expensive-game/index.htm
 
the $4500 example above was many years ago. competition in the warranty market has increased and they are much less expensive nowadays.  still, do your homework and check around. credit unions often offer much cheaper products that do more if you finance with them.  companies like state farm insurance now do auto financing and will give you gap for free if you finance through them!  my credit union charges $349 for gap. dealerships charge $750 and above.  i hope you can appreciate the value.

"by having my roomate walk in while i was practicing cowgirl riding.... oof

my roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on sunday night. she usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

a week ago, i ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. i don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. so this was fucking fantastic and i was ecstatic.

my plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so i could sit on it and act like it was my bf. i'm not really experienced in the sex department and i wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so i was going to practice until she got back.

before i get into the main event. i need to explain the layout of this house. when opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that used to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. after leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. however since we got it fixed it's silent.

now on to the main event. i had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so i could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. then i pulled out my new toy and i literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

then i got dressed down to what i would be wearing. it was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath i had my lingerie, i did this so i would be in the head space and so i could i imagine the upcoming day.

at this point i'm on the toy and i had a pretty good groove going and i was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so i grabbed some pillows to support, and then i heard a noise. i fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! i shoo'd him out and continued.

another couple minutes go by and i can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. until i realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. i then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and i felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. i heard the suitcase stop and when it did i hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. i was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

lightbulb!

my shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! i sat myself right back down, turned the tv on rick and morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like i had been watching this the entire night.

she came in and saw me and asked why i was sitting like that and i made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and i was just letting it stretch out. she nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that i was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

we sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. she told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

at this point i'm so sore and by sheer will i'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

the moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. i reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. she does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  i pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


tl;dr: tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

update 1: thanks so much for the lovely gold! it's my first one and it makes me happy! for the record, i am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. i haven't told my bf yet since i'm still a bit embarrassed! but i'm planning on telling him on the day. also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

update 2: since it's being asked alot, the reason i was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. i was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. so there were boxes and all that jazz.

update: i tried keeping up with all the comments... i give lol my pupper has been posted in r/aww",4
"when a speaker does the whole ""good morning!""....""oh come on y'all can do better, good morning!"" routine, no one should say good morning the second time.. i just think it'd be funny if it went completely silent after a public speaker tried it. it's super annoying to have to say ""good morning"" or anything like that anyway, especially if you already didn't wanna be there.

"if people who have gun licenses will lose them if they are prescribed marijuana or smoke legalized marijuana, the same should go for gun owners who drink alcohol.. the entire basis of taking a gun owner's gun/license from them is absolutely asinine in its logic.  lawmakers think that if you smoke pot you will be more likely to shoot someone with a firearm if you own it, yet they have no problem with cooter owning 20 shotguns and rifles and drinking a 12 pack of beer every day after work because we all know that no one ever got angry while they were drunk at home or in public and got into a fight/went into a rage.  quit the fucking double standard, if you are going to punish legal gun owners over smoking a plant then the same punishment should go for legal gun owners who keep budweiser in business.",6
"for withholding from my children that my husband had a wife and child before he met me? they've just found out and are acting like i've betrayed them.. my children are 17 and 14 respectively, and i'm hoping the fact that they're teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. 

my husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. no one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. 

i had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. it was at an aa meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the us. 

i have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. i like to joke that i'm keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. i've had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- i am so damaged that i just feel lucky that i got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. 

we had two children- two sons. we'd never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it's a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. 
he has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. 

my mother in law told the kids this sunday gone, as she decided it was 'time for them to know'. she didn't consult us before telling them, and certainly didn't do it in our presence. 

since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they've been prodding their dad asking why we'd never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they're acting like we've kept a secret affair family from them or something. 

my 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. i broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing i'd ever heard him say. i asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. 

he told me that it made 'so much sense' why we were abnormal, why we don't drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. 

the two are pretty heartbroken, and i feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children's lives as a result of us staying quiet. i am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and i don't know how to proceed. i have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.",3

"i (37m) just inadvertantly stumbled upon some suspicious activity with my wife (36f). so our phone bill came due but it was more than usual so i gave it a once over to see where the extra charges came from. turned out to be new activations, no big deal. although, while on the main page i noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. i expect her to have a lot of texts. i got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when i text her at work cause shes busy.....who could she be texting? i decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

i honestly dont know what to think. my curiosity got to me and i started plowing through old phone bills. this number started showing up on august the 8th. since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. often into the wee hours of the morning. shes never mentioned any new friends... 

so i get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and i start helping her find it. i found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. i hate being that guy but i did it. checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. some dude . she has him programmed first and last name. checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and i also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

i love my wife and i trust her completely, i think. i dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. and actually now that i think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. 😕 i really dont like the direction this is heading. am i reading to much into this? we've been married for 6 years and have 2 kids. we havent had a date in months and havent had sex in even longer than that. not for lack of trying on my part. shes gained a little weight and says she just always feels gross. anyone have any advice?

tl;dr wife texts dude over 16k times since august; shits pointing towards infidelity but i'm trying to rationalize her actions...",7

"i gave my brother the drugs that killed him.. it's been 4 years since he died. i know i'm responsible for it. he was 17. he wasn't very popular in highschool, but he'd been invited to his first big party. i was excited for him. he wanted to try get some more friends,become more popular. i helped him pick out what to wear, told him what to expect and do and all that shit. he'd asked me to buy him booze to bring with him, but instead i gave him some of my weed. he'd smoked a couple times with me before, i thought he'd be fine. i dropped him off, and told him to call when he wanted a lift home. that was the last time i saw him alive.

it was about 3am when my i heard my mum crying. from what i was told, he smoked and shared the weed with some people. they decided to go out to get food. my brother was the only one who hadn't had any booze so they asked him to drive. him and 3 people went out, during the drive they say he ""fell asleep or something"". he crashed into a pole, he died on impact and the person the front got their leg injured. the two in the back had minor injuries.

the police investigation was short. the car was okay and wasn't to blame, no signs of speeding, it had to be the drugs. i knew it was my fault. my parents tried to comfort me after i told them i'd given it to him, but i know they partly blame me too,things haven't been the same since.

i fell into a major depression. i drank and smoked pretty much all day. i lost my job. my parents tried to help support me financially but i spent all the money they gave me on booze and weed. my friends all disappeared after i stopped replying to their messages. it took over a year before i realised what i'd become. i started seeing a shrink. got clean. i'm 2 years sober. but every day i still know what i've done. every day i regret that decision.

i've written this out dozens of times over the last couple years. my doctor says it's good for me. i just want to post it online in hopes it does something. i don't even know what. i don't deserve forgiveness.

edit: i would like to thank all of you for your support and care and everything. i honestly didn't expect this and how many people would even read this. 
despite how many of you feel, i do truly believe i am responsible. i didn't make him go behind the wheel, but i gave him the weed that caused it. without that i truly believe he wouldn't have crashed. the police said there was no alcohol in his system and i honestly can't imagine he took any other drugs. but that is behind me now, it's a mistake i have to live with, ive come to terms with that.

edit 2:  i'd also like to clarify he didn't crash at 3am, that's when we got the call after the passenger had been pulled free because her leg got caught and was getting treatment. aplus it was in a semi-rural area, it would've taken police 30 minutes to get there. i believe that the police report said it happened around 1:30 to 2am.

a few have said that weed isn't a drug or wouldn't have caused this. but it is and it did. 2 years ago i would've agreed with you, but after therapy and getting clean i realised it is and that i was a drug addict, to both alcohol and weed. i've also come to terms with this. i hope that anyone in my situation gets help like i did. i used weed and booze as a tool to escape. i used it so i could pretend i wasn't myself for a few hours or just so i could sleep at night. but really it just hid my problems and that isn't healthy. there is help out there.

the only positive i can say from my story is that my brothers death woke me up. since getting clean i've started exercising, i'm going back to university next year, and my mind just feels more clear. it's kind of hard to describe.

i don't want to say 'don't do drugs' or make this a whole weed is bad thing. but don't use drugs to hide from your problems i guess is the point. seek help and help those who need it.

thank you all, truly.

edit 3: this will likely be my final edit to this post. once again, i'd like to thank all who commented for their advice, criticism and everything, it's all important as part of my therapy, even the negative.

what has disturbed me is fighting about weed, people have even messaged me to show their anger at me for saying it lead to the accident. saying that it doesn't make you tired, which is bullshit, i smoked and occasionally did edibles for 4-5 years, a lot of the time to help me sleep. whether it was him falling asleep for a moment and losing control, or a bad trip, or spacing out, or getting distracted, it doesn't matter. many people are insinuating he was drunk, but the police confirmed he was not i believe as part of the insurance claim for the car. i don't know, but they told my parents he hadn't been drinking.

i did this to try get some things off my chest, not so people could argue about how amazing weed is.",13

"aita: for not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?. i (f20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

the last time i lived here was 2-3 years ago. back then i remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn't want her boys to see it. 

now it's not like i was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

anyway i never stopped using the toilet bin. 

now i'm back she's started a new thing. moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that i keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when i'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

i personally think i absolutely should not be hiding the fact i have a vagina and it bleeds. her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. i would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. and i just want to be comfortable in the house i'm living in.

edit: for more info, this isn't a random house i've moved back into. i've lived here since i was 3 before my parents got divorced when i was 7. my step mum and her kids moved in when i was 12(ish). i moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons.

"you're taking a huge risk by linking venmo or paypal to your primary banking accounts.. your checking/savings accounts are very secure. they are heavily regulated including numerous laws designed to protect consumers.

venmo/paypal is none of the above. it is possible for someone to gain access to your venmo account (either by hacking in or even by sending you an unauthorized transfer). your connected checking/savings account can then be drained.

a lot of people mistakenly assume than venmo offers the same or even better consumer protections against fraud as their bank account, but this is untrue. having a secure checking account and then connecting it to venmo/paypal is like locking your door, arming your alarm and then leaving all your windows wide open.

**what should you do instead?**

there are at least two better options:

**for infrequent users, use a credit card (not a debit card) to send money, and just leave incoming transfers in venmo.**

yes, you will have to pay a fee for each cc transaction (usually 3%), but that 3% pays for an additional level of fraud prevention/protection from the cc company. for incoming transfers, it's not going to hurt anything to leave a few hundred dollars parked in venmo.

**for frequent users, link an air gap checking account to your venmo.**

lots of industries use air gaps as part of their safety/security protocols. an air gap checking account is an account that's connected to venmo and not connected to anything else. if you want to transfer money to/from your air gap account, you'll need to physically withdraw cash from one account and physically deposit it in the other.

sure, both of these options may be inconvenient, and they may cost some extra money in cc fees or account fees. but here's the thing you need to keep in mind: if you can't afford to pay 3% in cc fees, or you can't afford to leave $200 parked in venmo, or you can't afford the account fees to open another checking account, then **you definitely can't afford to have your primary banking accounts drained** by fraudulent venmo charges.",11

"my dog keeps getting attacked by an emotional support dog in our apartment.. \wisconsin\ there is an 8 month old male german shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. i have a six month old australian shepherd. we live on the fifth floor and the gs lives about four doors down. we run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

he has attacked my as in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. he attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the gs was hostile. the worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. when we walked inside the gs was off his lease and immediately started attacking my as. the owner did not immediately intervene. i got down to try to get between the gs and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. after about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the gs off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. i took pictures after the event. i had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my as's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

i first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. they said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. i spoke with the owner of the gs after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their gs just for on the grounds. the attacks have happened so often that i do not think they can easily control their dog. my as is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from gs's if he sees them in public.

after seeing the gs and the owner for about a week after these events, i kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. i spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. she said that the 8 month old gs is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. i suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. she said she is not comfortable with that.

i do not know the logistic of esd's but i do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. what should i do in this situation? i feel that if i go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume esd's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).

&#x200b;

**edit:** this post got a lot of responses and i'm so thankful for it. i read all your comments. unfortunately the post was locked before i even got off work so i didn't get to reply to all.

stemming from the advice i got i contacted the apartment again via email so that i'd have a paper trail, i explained that she said she would not muzzle him due to him ""being a esd"". i also provided links to local government sites stating that esd's are not the same as service dogs, and directly asked that they intervene at this point. i am awaiting their response.

i also called the local department of neighborhood services. i filed my case, she said they will assign someone to it who will contact me and begin the investigation into it.

in lieu of this, i then contacted the pet store where the worst attack occurred. the owner was very supportive on the idea of starting a case against them. she remembered the incident and said that i had made a purchase afterwards, so she looked up my name and found the exact time we were in the store. she said she will trim the cctv footage into a clip and email it to me.

so now i will have footage of the attack in the store, a picture of the resulting marks on my arm as well as my dogs bloody paw, and the email exchange with the apartment. i feel pretty ready to get this started now.

thank you to everyone who came here to help. i really had no idea where to go with this. i'd just like to say that my goal is not to have their dog euthanized. i blame the owners completely for this. i'm sure with the proper training he would not be so uncontrollable. my goal is for the gs to be muzzled while he is in public, and hopefully to be removed and given to responsible owners if possible. thanks for everyone's care and advice!

"buying my son's halloween candy away from him. my kids go trick or treating. we live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

when they're young we tell them santa brings every boy and girl a present on halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he'd leave in exchange. 

when the kids get old enough to realize santa is a hoax, that's when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

did this with our oldest two and it worked great. they'd give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the santa thing. we explained the new deal. 

he said ""so then it's my money and i can buy *whatever* i want with it? a new skateboard even? *anything*?"" ""you bet."" ""swear?"" ""yep."" 

he goes and brings us **all** his candy. even every kit kat, his favorite. i was shocked, but he'd been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must've decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 i'd spent all week. 

next day i brought the candy to work. then we went to walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. we met at the check out. 

there's my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred kit kats for $10.00. 

i started to tell him to put it back, but he said ""what? you said i could buy *whatever* i wanted! you swore! i want my candy back then."" 

his candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. and i did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

so... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

i don't know who's more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this.

"i (f25) found out my fiance (m27) is with me for money/family business. to preface. my family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. thus i am a trustfund baby. i try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
i met my fiance mark when i was 20 and working as a waitress.

we began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

now mark is not poor. he is upper middle class. and while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. i thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. what i want to say is that i never had the impression that mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

in the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and i stood up for him and fought with my dad. they came to love and accept him. when mark graduated dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

sunday i was supossed to work in the evening and i was going to stay with my sister. but i got a fever and was basically just non functioning so i stayed home. instead of staying in our bedroom i made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (i didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so i just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

mark came home when i was fast asleep and i was woken up by loud voices in our garden. i pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark was there with a few friends. just as i wanted to say hello i noticed that they were talking about me.

his friend kept laughing and calling mark ""the man!"". then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and i am free"".

at this moment i felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. i kept hearing them calling me trust fund barbie and stupid and so on. i didn't know what to do so i just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. i texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

i haven't returned home and just told mark that i was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
my sister has been really worried but i just feel so ashamed about everything. my family was right mark is a gold digger and i fell for it. even if i tell my family what happened i have no proof. my father can't fire him just because he is a dick. as far as i know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him i think. i just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

edit : we are non us. mark wasnt talking about anything else. he has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it i helped pay it off. there is no way he wasn't talking about me

edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. i opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. we have called up dad and i will talk to him tommorow. i will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

edit3: some questions have come up.

i don't drive that's why my fiance didn't see my car. i mostly uber arround

i worked as a waitress for the experience not for the money and i don't anylonger

i don't work for my father i am a company shareholder and i have to go to the general quartal meetings but i don't work for him.

"american colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.. according to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. in america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


in those 8 years of school, i must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. there are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and i hate using this term) a sheep. to my understanding, american colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (not 100% sure on that) so, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of stem field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


edit: ok, i understand and agree that philosophy is important. however, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. i just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. hell, my school has bio ethics, i haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

it honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",6

"my wife (25f) let her idiot friend (28f) negligently discharge one of my (30m)rifles. i'm angry with both of them and my wife is acting like i'm being unreasonable. advice?. obviously, i keep some guns. just for hunting and sport shooting.

i've got four rifles right now and i keep them locked in a safe in my barn.

before we got together two years ago, my wife had never really been around guns and at first wasn't too interested. after some time (and me explaining my philosophy on why i like to hunt), she has started to express an interest in learning to hunt for herself.

so over the last couple months i have been showing her how to handle and shoot a hunting rifle. taking her to the range, doing some dry practice at home, etc. she's been learning a lot and doing a great job. and she has been very careful to follow proper safety on her firearms which makes me a little madder about the situation this morning.

she had a friend come over this morning. i already don't have a high opinion of this friend. i think she is kind of an idiot, but she's also got that unfortunate personality trait where she tends to be way overconfident and think she knows everything about any given subject. i've gotten into a few mild arguments with her over it. but she's at least harmless so i never worried about her too much.

so this friend came over today. i figured the ladies would just chill out or something and i kinda found my way outside to work on my car, mostly so i didn't get sucked into a conversation with the friend.

at some point i saw them leave the house and head to the barn, but i didn't think much of it. half an hour later i heard a gunshot from inside the barn.

i freaked a little and ran into the barn. i found my wife and her friend, her friend holding one of my rifles, and they were both looking at me like they realized they really messed up.

in the immediate moment, after i saw the ladies were okay, i took my rifle out of friends hands and was mostly concerned with where the round had gone, luckily it just landed in the dirt a few yards away.

so with all that sorted, i wound up heading back inside and took my rifle back inside and got it put back away, and then with the immediate concern gone, i started to get mad.

i'm not necessarily proud of the language i used, but i'll try and portray it accurately since i am asking you alls opinions.

i asked the girls ""why. the. *fuck*. was one of my guns pulled out?""

friend didn't say anything at all, but my wife started explaining that friends husband wants to take her hunting sometime, so she was showing her a little bit about how to use a rifle.

so then i asked why it was loaded. i *know* i clear my guns before they go back in the safe, so i know there wasn't a round in there. and i keep my ammo in a whole different safe then the guns, which incidentally, was opened.

wife explained again she was showing friend how to load it. friend loaded it successfully, obviously, looked down the barrel, and ""accidentally"" pulled the trigger, according to my wife.

they were making a ""woops!"" face that kind ignorant upset me more. and it didn't help matters when my wife's friend started telling me that ""every rifle she is used to"" has a different kind of safety mechanism and-i don't know, i stopped listening to her there and told her it was probably best that she leave.

i locked up my guns and ammo, collected the keys from my wife and went back outside for a smoke. friend takes off shortly after that and my wife approaches me.

she approached me and just said ""sorry"". i was still mad so i told her something like ""yeah...'sorry' isn't quite going to cut it here.""

and then i asked her what she was thinking, because she *knows* better than this. i know she knows better because i taught her!

i told her she made a string of very bad decisions that started with opening the gun safe, handing one of my rifles to someone who very obviously doesn't know how to handle it, then opening the ammo safe, *letting her load a fucking round* and then letting her swing it around!""

my wife started getting defensive. she told me i've taken her shooting on our property before. the effect was the same here, right.

i told her, yeah, we've gone and shot empty bottles and stuff, but we got out into the woods and do it in front of a hill that we know works as a backstop. we *dont* just load a gun and fire wherever!""

wife told me that she *did* make sure her friend pointed in a safe direction at least, meaning out the door towards the ground. and i got a little mad again and said something along the lines of ""yeah, and it's a good fucking thing you did or else one of us would probably be in a police car by now!""

my wife finally said it was just an accident and i didn't have to make such a deal over it, i told her that this was an accident that *would* have killed someone if her luck had been slightly less.

she walked away and as she did i said something to her like ""do not go in the gun safe again without asking me."" she got re-pissed at that and asked why i'm treating her like i'm her ""dad"". i told her that those guns are registered to me and i don't want to go to jail if she hands it to someone who doesn't need to have it.

and thats where we've been all day. we're kind of just avoiding each other. that sort of argument is very uncharacteristic of my wife. she is generally a very responsible and level-headed woman and she is also pretty good about taking responsibility when she makes a mistake. this is the only real shouting-argument we've had and it really bothers me that she's throwing blame on me instead of recognizing how serious this mistake was.

like if she had at least admitted that she made a serious mistake i probably would not have added that bit about staying out of my gun safe.

i *do* for myself feel bad for cussing at her, because i never do that. and what she said about me acting like her dad hit a nerve to. so i'll probably apologize for the cussing here once i'm a little less angry.

so what should i do to handle this now? first big argument, and my wife seems to want to downplay how big of a deal this is. i don't want to talk down to her, but i do, really want her to acknowledge what a bad decision(s) she made or i'm not sure i'll be able to trust her handling one of my guns again. there is also the matter of her friend. like i said, my wife is normally a very responsible and mature woman, but when she gets around her friend it's like she gets......stupider, for lack of a better term. that is something that has bothered me about her friend before, but i've never said anything because it wasn't that big of a deal before.

how should i approach this? how do i get my wife to stop avoiding me right now for one, and how can i get her to recognize the seriousness here without her feeling like i'm trying to be her dad?

"by stripping in front of my girlfriends bff's nsfw. it's as stupid as it sounds.

yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her bffs. they usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

around that time i'm usually at the gym so to not disturb them. but yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so i went there an hour earlier.

sometimes after i come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
so i come home early and hear the tv running and i assumed, that she didn't hear me.
that's when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

i busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. some get red and look away, some stare at me like they've never seen a man's privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved wtf. 

the silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. i uttered a loud fuck and she instantly replied with: „good plan, bad execution."" her friends all laughed and even i had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

i even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

"boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, i was not raped.. i am in boston but my abortion happened in new york city. i was 18 and this was completely legal. 

i'm 18 and in college. like all 18 year olds, i mess up. i messed up big time and i ended up pregnant. i waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, i went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and i took a couples' trip to nyc so i could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

we got back to boston and life went on. i am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. i have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, i'm not considered depressed, i have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. i receive my therapy in a non religious environment. this is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before i went to college, my parents are toxic, and i needed help with that burden. 

i told my therapist immediately that i'd had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, i go to a university that i worked my ass off to get into and i'll be damned if i let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. i also could not raise a child that i disdained. selfish? yes. but i'm not sorry). i also informed her that my boyfriend and i are still together and that he and i plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. he and i split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

i go home and do homework. at around 4 pm, i get a visit from the boston police who are investigating a rape. they think that i'm the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that i've been forced to have an abortion, i ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and i agreed that abortion was the way to go. after a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

then i get a call from my parents. they're ranting on and on about how i've gotten an abortion and sinned in god's eyes, how i've been fornicating and screwed every man in nyc, and how my lack of contact (i'm nc with them because of abuse and they're narcissists) is killing my mother. they screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they've been given my address in boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

it becomes clear. my therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (i never gave her their number, address, or personal information. she did not know their names, i only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that i'd been raped and gotten an abortion. 

i never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. i never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when i mentioned the sex, i called it ""consensual sex"". the police are still hounding me, i'm freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by continuing to knowingly provide false information to the police (although i gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that i have stockholm syndrome and that's why i won't report my boyfriend, and i'm at a loss for what to do. 

i also know why she's having some weird witch hunt. my boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, i was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). i was not and in the session i said specifically told her that i never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that i was raped at his fraternity house. 

i've also started to get calls from the nypd investigating the ""forced abortion"" and i'm freaking out and don't know what to do. this is serious. 

at this point in time i know that i need to get the police off my butt. is there a way that would help me? is a lawyer the best way to go? also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? is there a way to make sure she doesn't do this again? 


edit: when the cops came the first time, i told them that she was completely falsifying everything and i gave them evidence. she is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so i'm not taken seriously. the last time the cops called was last night.

so, it has come to my attention that i was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. for more information on pets and chemo i went to this site, seems reliable(https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

in keeping with the spirit of this sub i'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, ""if your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person.""

i know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. the reason i think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, especially in instances when the animal is suffering.

in closing, i get it. putting your pet down is a very personal decision, but i still get to think you're a bad person if i think your reasons are shitty.",6

"by putting a rock in my ear, then leaving it for roughly 13 years.. bit of context; i was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. i'm 26 now. 

well it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and i had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. it's where i got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?

while i sat amongst rubble and dirt, i had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.

again, i wasn't bright. 

well. i drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.

that said, i flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly i can't remove it. not a single adult was even aware i was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.

so when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.

i lost my mind.

my dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. whatever really.

either way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that i was overreacting.

okay. sure.

let's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and i'm in highschool.

this is where the real fun begins. equalbrium (equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. i could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. was a nightmare, really.

i get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that ""imaginary rock"" i had long ago forgotten.

all i hear is scrapes.

scrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.

i'll admit, i immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. that's another topic entirely.

well wouldn't you know, though? the doctor said i was faking, examined my ear, and said i just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. right. it was probably june at the time.

my mom didn't really believe him, but i decided ""balls to it. let's get some hydro-perox!"", because fuck hospitals really.

skip along the years a bit more, i'm 18 and i know for a fact there is something in-my-fucking-head. i'm losing it. so i hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, ""there's definitely blockage. i'm not sure if it's a rock, but i can certainly try to help.""

so this professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of scissor-hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. it was audio torture, hands down. rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.

the end results? ""you'll need to see a specialist"", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.

i'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.

the sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and i began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when i reflect back.

let's time jump one last time. i'm 22, couple months away from 23, i have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. great.

but now, out of the blue, i'm losing hand-eye coordination. well damn, you know? i attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.

i lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that i could dig this chunk of earth out myself.

three different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. but that last one was phased from the situation immediately.

this was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and i locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.

eventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. in an instant i froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.

jackpot.

now, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.
the pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like i was passing a kidney stone from my skull.

all in all, 2/10. wouldn't do again.

but now it's totally out and i have it put away in a ziplock bag.

i had no real recovery issues i guess. as soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. now it just rings occasionally.

my balance won't ever be the same i feel, but it's fine enough as is. otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, i have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and i get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.

not a bad trade out.

"i guess i am my brothers keeper. i used to watch over my little brother (who at the time we didn't know has aspergers) when he was at school. kids would always pick on him and when he came home with bruises, i ditched school (i was in high school and he was in middle school) and snuck onto campus during recess and lunch times, but always stayed a ways away. 

i saw some little asshat push my brother down and watched as he got back up, picked up his books and walked away, even though the boy was following him and smacking the back of his head. after my brother made it into the classroom, i ran up, grabbed the kid by the back of the neck and without thinking, head butted him. once he started to cry, i pulled him in and told him if he ever lays a hand on that little boy again, i'd break every last one of his sad little bones. i've never told anyone about doing that. 

after school, i watched my brother begin to walk home and the little shits friend walked up to him, yelled something about ""some dumb older girl"" (i can only assume he meant me) and he pushed my brother into the street and a car had to slam on its breaks to avoid hitting him. 

at that point, i lost it. i pulled my brother onto the sidewalk, made sure he was okay and told him not to move. i ran over to the little shit (i didn't care that he was younger. not one bit), grabbed him by his hair and yanked him to the ground and started beating the ever loving crap out of him. at some point, i broke his arm. 

the driver of the car that almost hit my brother had called the police and pulled me off of him, but backed me up 100% and told the officer the truth about what he saw. i got insanely lucky. the police officer told me he has a little sister with autism and he probably would have done the same thing. 

didn't even get punished in the slightest, was just told to take my brother home and to promise never to hit anyone again. (the best i could give was to never get caught hitting anyone again). 

we stopped by the 7/11 on the way home and i got us both some ice cream. i don't know if he remembers that day now but i'd still do it all over again in a heartbeat. ",13

"i (27f) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work. hello,

as the post says i am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **virginia**. i work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. when i was hired i wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. i think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that i'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. i have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. so then i had to buy a wireless mouse. i have a nice computer and i hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

&#x200b;

today i have strep. strep as an adult is terrible. i told my boss i could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. that night on the phone she said yes please work from home. first thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. it is a google chrome timer extension. i told them that i would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but i was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. she said ok, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since i wouldn't install the timer and that i was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

this is on top of the fact that i have to clock in/ clock out on an app on my phone that tracks my gps. yes, i have a master's degree and have to clock in/out even for lunch. during the entire time it is on, gps is tracked.

"when i was hired i was given a key and told if i lose it i owe $15,000. i lost it. do i have to pay up?. i am located in michigan.  

okay so when i was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) i was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  i was told that if i ever lost said key i would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

i have lost this key.  (it was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. i was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

so now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money i owe.""   i have received letters from their official letterhead and i am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. and they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

i have no intention of paying the fine.

the catch is that i was told this was the consequence verbally when i was handed the key.  my supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   i replied with ""to be clear, i will not be paying that if i haven't signed yet.  do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  my supervisor laughed as though i was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

well he never brought it up again and i of course did not either.  

my question is.  can i be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" at this point i have not reminded them that i never signed.  i have simply ignored them.  but i worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and i'm not sure how to proceed.  i will be visiting my lawyer monday.  so hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. i can not afford this ""charge.""

"for not paying for the extra meal i accidentally ordered at a wedding?. my sixteen year old son and i went to a wedding. when we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. there was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but i never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. i sent in the rsvp card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

at the wedding, my son and i got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. the waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. the waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

i later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that i had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. i told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. they said i should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that i should have asked for clarification if i wasn't sure. but i wasn't unsure, i never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. ten and under i would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up i would never think would have a kid's meal. the bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but i've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. i think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old. 

if i refused to pay for the extra meal and told them it was their mistake for changing my son's order? i know wedding meals are expensive, but i think this was their mistake.",3

"i once trucked a girl in high school and it keeps me up at night. in high school i played football and i was pretty tall and big. when walking to classes it actually kind of sucked because i had to stop to let people go into doors so i wouldn't run into kids because i could accidentally knock somebody over. 

i had another friend on team who walked with me to class and we would occasionally fuck around in the hallway by pushing each other, just dumb shit. we were messing around when he pushes me when we're making a turn down the hallway, and i backup and feel something against me. 

i look down an a poor girl, who was probably a freshman, is laying on the ground. absolutely terrified. i go down to help her up and my friend still doesn't understand what's happening and thinks we're still messing around, so he pushes me again and i almost ended up trampling her. she got up on her own and rushed down the hallway probably with tears in her eyes because i had just knocked her into a brick wall and onto the ground. 

i never got reported to a teacher so i'm assuming she had no injuries. this wasn't the last time something like this happened. i was walking to class after lunch when a friend came over and pushed me as a joke. i said ""get away from me"" at the exact same time a girl accidentally hit me while walking by, looked at me super offended and walked off.",13

"by swallowing my little sister's birthday present. i am so beside myself with shame that i almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

but reddit karma is my mistress and i must heed her sweet call. 

so yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), i was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

now, i cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. i looked at that ring in my hand and i just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a bugs bunny cartoon. my primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

so i did it.

i think it was the next split second when i saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that i realized what a horrible mistake i had made. 

so my little sister runs screaming from my room and i hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as i admitted that i, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. no, i didn't know why i did it. yes, i am an idiot. no one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

so brief intermission from my sister's birthday as i make a quick excursion to the er, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them i was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. they took a couple x-rays and i hung around the er for about 8 hours before they broke the news that i was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

i shat out the ring this morning. 

happy birthday sis. 

tl;dr: i am an idiot and i ate my sister's ring because i thought it would be funny. 

edit: good fucking god my inbox. tune in tomorrow morning and i'll share a picture of the accursed ring

edit 2: no, not a picture of it covered in shit.

"google charged me $299.99 for 30tb storage that i did not authorize and now they won't refund my money. i received a notification from paypal at 10:21pm et that a $299.99 charge was made on my wife's google play account. the payment was for 30tb storage for 1 month. my wife's account is only using 7gb (and google offers 15gb free) so it does not make sense that we would want 30tb of storage!  we did not authorize this charge and nobody in my house made this purchase.  kids are sleeping and wife was taking a shower at the time.  i called google immediately and they refused to refund the money saying it happened ""inside the account"" so basically accusing us that we did it.  no suggestions to change our passwords and that it might be an unauthorized charge from a different computer. no information as to which ip address the charge came from was provided. they said to contact paypal to open a dispute if i want. google has canceled the storage account so it is no longer active. i'm not sure what to do but this seems like a very unfair policy from google. any suggestions?

update: i called again this morning and spoke to another representative ""michael"" who was a lot more empathetic and helpful. they submitted the return request again and said it should be approved this time. also a redditor who works for google reached out to me here on reddit and is checking on the case for me from the inside. hopefully i can get this resolved via refund and can close that paypal dispute, since we don't want to lose my wife's account if at all possible. thanks for the support everyone.

update2: success! http://imgur.com/u4yvl6q after talking to the second google representative this morning, and most likely with help from an anon googler who contacted me via reddit pm, they have refunded my money! i have closed the paypal dispute and just waiting for the refund to ""clear"" (currently it is in pending status). i told the second call center rep this morning the exact same thing, we don't know who made this purchase. also i did not mention this reddit post. he was super professional, empathetic and took care of me. even his email was reassuring, he said ""don't worry about it, we will take care of this!""...

lessons learned: 

- be persistent! the first call center rep might give you a hard time but calling back validates or tests their stated policy and in my case it proved that they could in fact help me if they wanted to.

- don't leave credit cards or paypal pre-authorized payment methods connected for years on end. from now on i'll be disconnecting these payment methods as soon as they are used. it's not that hard to retype a credit card or paypal credentials.

- use 2 factor authentication! although there is a possibility this could have been done accidentally in my house by my son (he still hasn't fessed up) this has been an exercise in learning where our security gaps are and making sure we're not too naive when it comes to account protection.

thanks for your help pf community!",11
"i waited for a woman to enter the dressing room in goodwill and switched a pair of mens shorts i wanted out of her basket with a similar looking pair, immediately bought them and left.. i actually looked at the shorts before she was even in the store but decided not to get them until later when i looked them up online and saw they were regularly $50. they looked brand new and goodwill was selling them for $5... when i went back to get them they weren't there but i happened to see them in this woman's basket. pretty sure she was a bargain shopper. i'm fucking pathetic.

edit: i still feel bad about doing this but another part of me doesn't give a fuck because her basket was full of clothes. i'm willing to bet that she doesn't even wear them (considering she bought men's shorts) but instead re-sells them. out off all those shorts that one was the only one she picked up. she probably did the same damn thing and looked them up. and no i didn't change my mind because i want to ""flex"" by wearing expensive stuff. at least i'll actually fuckin wear them unlike her.

"i changed my grade senior year of high school, with the principal in the room.. it was senior year of high school, and we were doing a partnered assignment in environmental science, tracking the river behind the school to find its source. there was an odd number of students and i was okay with working alone. 

that day the principal was ""observing"" the teacher, evaluating her performance. my teacher trusted me, and gave me her laptop to do the assignment, and asked if i would show the principal what we were doing. i agreed and quickly finished my assignment. 

the principal and teacher were standing by the door chatting, so i open the powerschool app. there it is... all my friends grades, including mine, staring at me in an excel style format. 

i notice copious amounts of 0's by my name, dragging my grade down somewhere in the low 70's. (i was a minimal effort high schooler) i quickly changed most of the 0's to 70's or 60's. this way it wouldn't look too suspicious.

"i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone. i am sick, devastated and don't know what to do.. first time poster so i apologize if this is rambly. to preface: i started dating david (not real name obv) at the beginning of february.  only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship i was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well that i didn't think much more about it. i fell hard and he did too. things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and i can't afford the place by myself). he and i have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and i have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time i've known him, so i didn't really see any red flags there. everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

last week i came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and i played it off like i had no idea what he was doing. fast forward to two days ago, i was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (i don't care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. so when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, i quickly peeked through his search history. there was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly ""teen"". i didn't think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then i saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. ""p*do pics"" etc had been entered around 5 times. 

i quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, i had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. i couldn't imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; i know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. so last night i peeked through his photos on his iphone and was traumatized. there were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while i'd fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. i felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

a bit further up in his photos i discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. they all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. i was numb, i was angry, i was devastated, i couldn't think and i was so disturbed at what i was witnessing. i have never seen cp in my life and i can't get these horrible images out of my head. i scrolled pretty far up and didn't really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the ""petite teen"" category. 

i guess i'm just posting here because i have no idea what else to do. i don't know how to confront him and i know i must separate from him immediately but i'm terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and i don't want to get in trouble. he must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  he practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially i am fucked by this. 


please help reddit, i feel so lost.

tldr: i discovered cp on my boyfriends phone last night. not sure how to proceed with anything.",7

all,

this thread will serve as the r/personalfinance official mega thread for discussing the recent equifax security breach(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-07/equifax-reports-cybersecurity-incident-potentially-impacting-143-million-u-s-customers). /r/legaladvice also has a mega thread on this issue(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6yvj5c/megathread_equifax_security_breach/) if you want to focus on legal options. the tl;dr of that thread is wait to join a class action and do not sue in small claims court.

**summary:**

* ""equifax inc. said its systems were struck by a cyberattack that may have affected about 143 million u.s. customers of the credit reporting agency...some u.k. and canadian residents were also affected."" canadian thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinancecanada/comments/6yq9gu/equifax_hacked_canadian_consumers_might_be/) and uk thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpersonalfinance/comments/6yvunm/misc_uk_details_in_equifax_data_breach/)

* ""intruders accessed names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver's license numbers...credit card numbers for about 209,000 consumers were also accessed.""

* ""criminals took advantage of a ""u.s. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files"" from mid-may through july of this year...the intruders also accessed dispute documents with personal identifying information for about 182,000 consumers.""

* ""the company set up a website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, that consumers can use to determine whether their information was compromised. it's also offering free credit-file monitoring and identify-theft protection.""

* the purpose of this sub is not to provide legal advice. however, per https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/frequently-asked-questions/
""the arbitration clause and class action wavier included in the trustedid premier terms of use applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products, and not the cybersecurity incident.""

* **identity theft wiki** - please see the identity theft wiki(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for steps to take if your identity has been stolen. you may wish to freeze your credit with the different reporting agencies. note that their websites are currently under a heavy load and may be unresponsive. for more information on what freezing your credit means, see the ftc's explanation(https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs#score)

equifax also recently announced(https://twitter.com/equifax/status/907596989260496896) that they are waiving fees for freezing your credit with them. it is unclear if they plan to offer refunds to those that paid to do so before today.

**using www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:**

* a helpful discussion adapted from u/likeasomebodie on using www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:

* check to see if you are effected using this link(https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/)

* either of the following messages from equifax mean your information was stolen:

thank you -- based on the information provided, we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident...

thank you -- your enrollment date for trustedid premier is: xxxxxx please be sure to mark your calendar...

* either of these messages mean that your ssn, dob, full address, and potentially dl number have been stolen. assume that information is now public data, because if it's not out there already someone's indexing it right now.

* please note that some media outliets are reporting that these messages are not completely reliable(https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/psa-no-matter-what-you-write-equifax-may-tell-you-youve-been-impacted-by-the-hack/) however, it still appears that using this site provides at least some information, even if it is not completely accurate.

* see the identity theft guide(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for additional information on freezing your credit, next steps, etc...

**additional information:**

* your credit card company may offer some form of identity theft protection/credit monitoring. you should review the benefits that your card has to see if this applies to you.

* equifax is making credit freezes free for some customers; it isn't clear if this extends to everyone or only certain individuals. update - it should be free to all - see the announcement here(https://twitter.com/equifax/status/907596989260496896). no word on whether previously paid fees will be refunded, but you can call and ask.

* it appears that, in some cases, the pin you get from equifax when freezing your credit is just a time stamp of when the freeze was initiated(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/your-money/identity-theft/equifax-breach-credit-freeze.html). if this happened to you, consider requesting a new pin by mail.

* some individuals are reporting difficulty obtaining a credit freeze online. you may need to submit documents via mail if this is the case.

* there is now at least 1 class-action lawsuit(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-08/equifax-sued-over-massive-hack-in-multibillion-dollar-lawsuit) on this issue. please keep in mind that per equifax's most recent financials, it has a book value of equity of only about 3 billion dollars on total assets of about 7 billion dollars, so it seems unlikely that 70 billion, even if awarded, could actually be paid.

* u/rholowczak has put together a handy tree of phone options when calling the major credit bureaus here(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6yv4gb/official_mega_thread_recent_equifax_security/dmyg4xe/).

"dash cams. after my wife telling me numerous stories of being ran off the road and close calls, i researched and ultimately purchased two $100 dash cams for both of our vehicles for a total of about $198 on amazon . they came with a power adapter and a 16gb micro sd card as a part of a limited time promotion. i installed both of them earlier this year by myself within a few hours by using barebones soldering skills and some common hand tools for a ""stealth wiring"" configuration. 

recently, my wife was in an accident and our dash cam has definitively cleared us of all liability. the other party claimed that my wife was at fault and that her lights were not on. her dash cam showed that not only was my wife's lights on prior to the impact, but the other party was shown clearly running a stop sign which my wife failed to mention in the police report due to her head injury. needless to say, our $200 investment has already paid for itself. 

with all of that in mind, i highly recommend a dash cam in addition to adequate insurance coverage for added financial peace of mind. too many car accidents end up in he said/she said nonsense with both parties' recollection being skewed in favor of their own benefit. 

car accidents are already a pain. do yourselves a favor and spend $100 and an afternoon installing one of these in your vehicle. future you will inevitably thank you someday. 

edit: thanks everyone for sharing your stories and asking questions. i'm glad i can help some of you out. with that said, i keep getting the same question frequently so here's a copy/paste of my response. 


wheelwitness hd is the dash cam i own. 

honestly, anything with an above average rating of 4 stars in the $100 range that isn't a recognized name brand is pretty much a rebrand of other cameras. if it has a generic name, i can guarantee you that they all use a handful of chipsets that can record at different settings depending on how capable it is. the only difference will be the physical appearance but guts will mostly be the same. 

as a rule of thumb, anything $100+ will probably be a solid cam. i recommend a function check monthly at a minimum. i aim to do it once a week. i found mine frozen and not recording one day. just needed a hard reboot. ",11

"by swiping on lesbians on tinder for 2 months.. this has been going on for two months and i just found out today. throwaway account because many know my real account and i don't feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

so i signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. i set up my account...set my interest in 'women' and started swiping. now when i signed up for tinder i linked my facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if i set my gender to woman. i had completely forgot. i'm not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but i was getting barely any matches and couldn't figure out why. figured the algorithms were just screwing me. over the course of the two months i would think ""wow short hair must be the new thing"" or ""so many bisexuals on here"" but never really thought anything beyond that. then this morning i woke up to a new match. she said i looked great, to which i replied thanks, you too! but then she replied with...""how long ago did you transition?"" i thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. that's when it all came together and i realized i've been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

"how are we able to perform a body transplant when we can't repair spinal injuries?. so as many of you have probably heard, the first attempted ""head transplant"" is scheduled to occur later this year. i haven't been able to find scientific articles on the subject but it seems they plan to fully connect the nerves/veins/etc, and the spine. however to my knowledge we still haven't figured out how to repair a typical spinal injury, so how can we, even if just in theory, expect to fuse two different spines to any extent?

edit: so this blew up quite a bit. for the record, i am well aware we can't fix do a body transplant yet, i simply wanted to know how we could even attempt it when we hadn't overcome a major hurdle like that though.

i am well aware the odds of success are super low, that's now what i'm asking about. 

i do believe a body transplant is something we could one day achieve, just not yet. eventually someone has to try, and that's what this is to me. this year's failure could led to next year's success",10
"student loan balance: $0. thank you pf for all of your help, and please accept my personal contribution.. **edit (2019.01.03):** updated template can be found in this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac701m/happy_new_year_pf_after_a_year_and_a_half_i_am/).

**edit:** several people requested access to the spreadsheet. you shouldn't need to request access. you should be able to `file > make a copy...`. please pm me if you are unable to do so.

i was raised in a family where finances were not ever discussed other than the fact that we did or did not have it. my father was an optimistic entrepreneur who struck gold, time and time again on many of his business ventures, but always found a way to blow through his riches with little to show for it. factor in my mother who was a hoarder and you had the perfect formula for disaster. i won't stroll too deep down memory lane, but long story short, i never completed my college degree and decided to go straight into the workforce instead.

seven years ago, i was laid off from a job that was ""paying the bills"" with no degree to fall back on. i made the decision to go back to school and about two years into my degree, i was caught in a financial bind, worrying about how i was going to take care of next semester's tuition. fortunately for me, i had an amazing aunt, uncle, sister, and bil who helped cover my expenses. after that incident, i swore to myself that as soon as i graduated, i would take charge of my own finances and do everything in my power to avoid going down the same path as my parents.

i've been a long-time lurker and have read countless personal stories shared on this subreddit throughout the years. even if the situation didn't apply to my own life, i took the time to sympathize with what others are going through in the event that i too may one day endure the same hardship. i silently cheered behind the scenes along with each success story shared. this sub is a daily read for me and became my source of encouragement towards living a debt-free life.

today, i get to share my own success story. i made a plan after graduating to aggressively pay off my student loans and have been blessed enough to have the means to do. i have made the final payment on my student loans. from $22,601.14 to $0 in 27 months.

along with the good news, i wanted to give back to the community that has been so helpful all these years. i created a spreadsheet to track my various finances and i'm hoping that it will help others as well.

**personal finance template:** 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rjhe3atepyuoe1wzpb9wmr2h7vfj45_iqc1jutr4wly/edit?usp=sharing

it may seem like there is a lot going on, but i will try my best to describe each tab in-depth to make it seem less scary.

**student loans:** my student loans were broken down into different groups (a, b, c, d) at different interest rates. i wanted to calculate the total interest over the life of each loan based on a set payment amount, so i made a rough amortization chart.

> **f2:** enter your interest rate.  
> **h2:** enter your desired monthly payment.  
> **m2:** enter your loan balance.

i wanted to find the sweet spot for what i felt comfortable paying while also trying to minimize the total accrued interest as best as i could, so i played around with various numbers for `h2`.

as an example, i entered $200 in `h2`. now i am searching for the row where the value in `column m` is negative. this happens in `m30`.

that means that if i make a monthly payment of $200 (`h2`), i would pay it off in 30 months (`g32`) and accrue $281.64 of total interest (`k32`).

i repeated the same process for $56.57 (the recommended minimum payment from my student loan provider), $150, $175, and $250 and then made a chart in `o1:r6` (http://i.imgur.com/c2yuvqg.png).

i calculated the savings based on how much **less** interest i would pay over the life of the loan if i paid more than the minimum payment. this became such a big motivator for me to continue to make aggressive payments that i decided to add it to the **summary** tab.

**summary:** this tab is exactly what it sounds like; it is a summary of all of my finances so that i can get a snapshot view of where my money is, along with my net worth, average credit score, and student loan ""savings"".

> **b2:** i update this formula once a month. currently the formula is `='2017.06'!$q$200`, pointing to the `2017.06` spreadsheet.. when june ends, i will simply update the formula to point to `='2017.07'!$q$200`.  
> **b10:** this is also updated monthly. next month, i would change the formula from `='credit score'!$f$20` to `='credit score'!$f$21`.

**2017.04, 2017.05, 2017.06:** this is where the bulk of the work comes in.

> **a:** enter the date of the posted transaction. if the transaction is still pending, leave the date blank until it has posted.  
> **b:** enter the merchant for the transaction. this column uses the **merchants** tab for data validation. to add a new merchant, simply add another entry in column **a** of the **merchants** tab.  
> **c:** enter the category for the transaction. this simply helps categorize your spending. use the **categories** tab for data validation.  
> **d:** enter all credit transactions to your bank account in this column.  
> **e:** enter all debit transactions to your bank account in this column.  
> **f:j**: i have four credit cards that i use in rotation. enter all credit card transactions under the corresponding column (adjust columns as needed).  
> **k:** this column shows the current balance of your bank account.  
> **l:p:** these columns shows the current balance of each of your credit cards.  
> **q:** i call this column the ""reality check"". it shows your true balance: the cash you have in your bank account minus all of the debts across your credit cards.
> **s:t:** this gives you a breakdown of where you are spending your money. it is another helpful way to keep your spending in check and should help you budget.

it might seem like a lot of work, but it has become routine enough for me that it takes me no more than 10 minutes in the morning.

my routine:  

1. log into charles schwab.
2. enter pending transactions (columns **b:j**).
3. enter dates for previously pending transactions (column **a**).
4. repeat 1-3 for citi, discover, amex, capital one.
5. select the columns that are out of order, then click `data > sort sheet by column a, a -> z`.

let's go through an example. 

in tab `2017.06`, i have the following pending transactions: http://i.imgur.com/xk1v89r.png

after logging into my accounts, i found that these transactions are all posted now, so i have entered the dates of the posted transactions in column `a`: http://i.imgur.com/wcry4gh.png

my transactions are out of order, which will happen often with pending transactions, so now i have to sort them.

i select columns `a53:j39` up to posted date `6/11`: http://i.imgur.com/b9rjttp.png

then click `data > sort sheet by column a, a -> z`: http://i.imgur.com/uib4kk7.png

my transactions are now sorted! http://i.imgur.com/qw7fw9r.png

that is pretty much all i do for daily transactions, though there are two things i want to make note of.

> **paying credit card bills:** when paying a credit card bill, i enter a debit in column `e` as well as a credit in the corresponding credit card column.
> 
> for instance, i paid my citi credit card bill on 6/2/2017 in the amount of $143. this is what that transaction looks like: http://i.imgur.com/fltk8bl.png

> **look-ahead:** often times, i will enter transactions that have not happened yet further down the spreadsheet. for example, if i know i have a credit card bill due later this month, or a rent payment, or an incoming paycheck, i will enter it in order to ""look ahead"" of my finances. this teaches me discipline in how i am spending my current balance while making sure that i am preparing for upcoming expenses.
> 
> an example of this can be seen in rows `90:91`: http://i.imgur.com/o5nhlrw.png
> 
> i know that i have a credit card bill due on 7/3, and i also have another paycheck coming on 6/30. entering both of these transactions allows me to gauge how prepared i am when that time comes.

at the end of the month, i simply right-click `2017.06` and click `duplicate`, renaming the new spreadsheet to `2017.07`. i also make sure that all of the formulas in `d2:j2` correctly point to the previous month.

> **d2:** change `='2017.05'!k200` to `='2017.06'!k200`  
> **f2:** change `='2017.05'!l200` to `='2017.06'!l200`  
> **g2:** change `='2017.05'!m200` to `='2017.06'!m200`  
> **h2:** change `='2017.05'!n200` to `='2017.06'!n200`  
> **i2:** change `='2017.05'!o200` to `='2017.06'!o200`  
> **j2:** change `='2017.05'!p200` to `='2017.06'!p200`

**ally savings 1.00% apy**: this tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs.

**stocks owned:** i use this tab to keep track of the current stocks that i own.

> **a:** enter the stock ticker.  
> **b:** enter the purchase date.  
> **c:** enter the number of shares purchased.  
> **d:** enter the purchase price.

rows `25:37` helps me track when i should sell the stock and what my net gain/loss would be.

> **c26:** enter the number of shares purchased.  
> **d26:** enter the purchase price.

the chart will show you what the sell price would be for a `10.00% - 65.00%` gross profit.

**stocks sold:** this just helps me keep track of my stocks sold over the years. i copy and paste the values directly from **stocks owned** when i choose to sell.

**401k:** this tab tracks all of my 401k transactions.

> **c:** enter the money contributed for the month.  
> **d:** enter the amount of gain/loss for the month.

columns `g:i` will give you the year-to-date statistics, but it is pretty barebones at the moment.

**hsa:** this tab follows the same structure as the monthly tabs.

**hsa investment:** this tab follows a similar structure as the **401k** tab.

**credit score:** this tab keeps track of my monthly free credit estimates offered by my credit cards. columns `h:i` tracks roughly what date a new credit score is available. it's interesting to see how your credit score is affected month to month based on various factors. for instance, my credit utilization was high from 09/2016 - 12/2016 due to the holidays and various trips. my credit took a dip for that period and then has been slightly rising since.

my wife and i separated last summer and my place has gone downhill since then. it's such a draining feeling to see a messy living room and kitchen. i can't ever get motivated enough to do it and then it becomes overwhelming to even try once it gets bad.

i hired a cleaning service awhile back and just had my second monthly appointment. my kitchen bathroom and living room are clean. i now can have guests over. i can cook food.

my mood has lifted. it makes me so happy to sit in a clean living room and to use a clean bathroom.

i was here yesterday when the cleaning woman came and she was very cool and nonjudgmental. she said she has adhd and ocd and it helps her with her issues to be able to help people and get paid too.

now my goal is to keep it tidy. i'm cleaning things as they get dirty and not putting it off.

it's like any other psychological issue. unless you have it, it seems like a minor thing but it cripples me emotionally to be this messy

please wish me success at turning this around.

edit: i am overwhelmed by the positive response to this post. i appreciate the kindnesses shown me. to clarify: yes, being messy is nobody's fault but mine. therapy taught me it is tied in with the abuse i suffered as a child but therapy hasn't yet fixed my messiness. when i was living with my wife, we shared the responsibility for chores and i did all the laundry and dishes. we didn't separate over cleanliness issues but rather a combination of other factors.
yes, i should have broken out of these patterns long ago. i've tried. i'm filled with shame and self-loathing over it. but i feel i've gotten a new lease on life and can only go on from here.

"update: my(25m) girlfriend(22f) wants to share our incomes, thing is, i make roughly 7 times as much, advice please. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dn1q0t/my25m\_girlfriend22f\_wants\_to\_share\_our\_incomes/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dn1q0t/my25m_girlfriend22f_wants_to_share_our_incomes/)

&#x200b;

so, i figured since the post sort of blew up a 3 weeks ago and people requested me to make an update to tell them what i ended up doing...well here goes.

well in the shortest way possible, i ended up breaking up with her, i realized in part thanks to some good advice i had gotten there was more that was bothering me other than the financial part. thing is, when thinking to myself in the next few days i felt myself combing over every little detail of our relationship and quickly realized i was putting in way more then what i got back, no i am not saying i am some perfect saint, but i do think i deserve someone who appreciates what i already do, especially when what i already do so vastly outweighs what she did in our relationship.

also a big one was the apparent maturity gap between the two of us which i looked over with my rose tinted in-love glasses, where as i have changed as a person from who i was when we started dating, she is still pretty much the same identical person and without trying to badmouth her, that is a person you can be without any issues when you between 15 and 20, not when you are in a committed relationship, thinking about having kids at some point, managing your own finances and planning for the future. 

and that brings me to the largest issue there, planning, i am a planner, i look out for the future, i am not opposed to wasting some money to do fun stuff while i am young, but i don't want to risk ending up broke and unhappy when i am older because i refused to get serious in my youth and this is where our personal views seemed to clash to an extend where the good no longer outweighs the bad, she constantly lives in the moment, spends what she can spend and is sort of used to an easy ride where the biggest things she ever had to worry about are her grades, but for me i have faced financial issues since i was young so i know the value of money and i know that planning can spare you a lot of hurt, i am not saying either of our views are superior or better, i am saying when you are supposed to be a partnership but you wildly differ on the most basic foundations of that partnership, there is not much hope, as a result i realized i did not see myself getting more committed to her which means you sort of hit a roadblock in your relationship, i mean i am not a fan of marriage from the get go, but after such a long time, if you are not even remotely considering it, there is probably a larger issue.

this argument about finances brought up a whole load of other issues for me and honestly, i sort of started to dread what in my mind looked like me being expected to fund a lifestyle i from the ground up do not agree with, i realized i was losing my own self worth by accepting this sort of stuff and i realized the fact we had an argument about my money and her demanding to spend half of it made me feel like a glorified atm.

now the break up was really messy and her dad was a rock during the entire thing, he calmed the situation down a lot despite him really hating what was happening but i think he understood, i can't say i am not gutted about all of this, after all this is someone i was with for roughly three years and getting used to not having her or her family(who i was really close too) is difficult but in the end after the initial dust settled i sort of feel liberated and a lot happier than i did a few weeks ago, i wish her nothing but the best in the future and i know it has to be without me, as for me, i sort of feel like i get to start over, hopefully find someone a lot more suited to me in the future, but i won't be actively looking for me as honestly being single after such a long time in a relationship feels nice? i get to focus what little free time i have on myself which is something i have not been able to do for a long time, i get to indulge in my hobbies properly and so forth.

anyhow, i want to thank everyone for their advice and if i was rude to anyone, i am sorry but at the time i was in a shitty emotional position, but i am doing a lot better now, so whether you figured i was a douche and completely disagreed with me or whether you think i was a good fellah and figured i was right, or somewhere on the extremes or in the middle, thanks for your advice!",7

the problem lies when vanessa asked me for money. you see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, i decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). that combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

since i gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. i told vanessa that i was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

she now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in it). she said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

i told her i cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. if/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, i'll be happy to contribute the money. but it's not just a free handout.

she's got really mad that i rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. to her credit, her brother and i have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while vanessa was more the troublemaker), but i do love my children equally. i told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiance, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. that if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, i will fully support it financially.

well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. my wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but i told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and i rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and when she has to move back home. i don't want her to think i support this decision.

she told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my vanessa, she's staying out of it. i, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. for sticking to my guns on this?",3

"by yelling ""it's boy scouts. get the gun!"". actually, it was my wife and a couple months ago during the boy scouts' popcorn sales (or whatever they are selling this year.) we always buy popcorn or whatever the boy scouts are selling since my son was once a boy scout and was a great salesman and won lots of prizes for his sales. so the boy scouts in the neighborhood can always count on us buying a few boxes from whoever shows up at the door.

we have three dogs. two of them go into a barking frenzy when anyone rings the doorbell. to combat this, we keep a water gun by the door since being squirt a couple of times shuts them right up. one day, the doorbell rings, the dogs go into their frenzy, and my wife notices that the squirt gun is not sitting by the front door but had been moved to the kitchen. so she yells ""it's boy scouts. get the gun!"" to my son in the other room. 

when she opened the door the two boys were about to bolt until they see the small purple water gun in her hand.

tl;dr boy scouts at our front door thought they were going to be met with deadly force.

edit: thanks for all the generosity! dog tax.(https://i.imgur.com/tohmu5r.jpg) they hate being squirt but get into water whenever they have a chance, even in the middle of the winter. spike is the cairn terrier. he's over 15 years old and has never barked at people or the doorbell. pepper is the schnauzer, and a true watch dog since he's a yapping machine. annie was a starving stray we found living under a bridge about 7 years ago. she is likely part basenji since although she barks, especially when pepper instigates her, she mostly whines loudly when she's excited.

"update coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex's dog euthanized. can i help prevent this?. link to first post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

glad to say i've got a happy update!

the coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). i wasn't working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

the ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. he's also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. the dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn't shown any human or dog aggression. 

police and animal control are very good around here. they assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they'd require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can't be ""bitten"" by the dog without violating it. and the department says they don't allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog's owner but not the police/animal control. 

so the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. i'd call it a win!

thank you all for your advice and support!",2

"mentally healthy people put too much hope in suicide prevention hotlines.. so these people think that tony's wife never listened to him?  that tony didn't have a therapist, or that he didn't take medication?  that he didn't have thousands of hardcore fans, each of them willing to listen to every problem or concern that crossed his mind?  they must think that none of these things were true to suggest that calling some random person who knew nothing about his issues or personal struggles could have magically talked him out of something he has probably been contemplating for a good majority of his life.

imagine if you had a car that broke down.  imagine further that your significant other is handy with a car took a look at it, but was unable to fix the issue.  so then you go to a real mechanic and they look at your car and do what they can to get it running, but it is still having issues despite taking it back to them weekly and paying out the ass.  then imagine that someone tells you not to sell the car but to instead call a mechanic hotline and that they will fix all your problems over the phone by asking you minimal questions and telling you that everything is ok with your car. 

what that analogy doesn't capture though is the absolute weight of that car being broken down, or how long that car has been causing problems.  i am 36 this week; i have had suicidal thoughts since i was 7 or 8.  that is 28-29 years of baggage.  baggage that stuck with me when i had a lot of friends, baggage that i carry to a therapist, baggage that i carried through a happy marriage, baggage that i carry when i am with my daughter, baggage that i medicate.  baggage that is so heavy and integral to my being to expect a random person to somehow come along and pick it up for me would be absurd.

this isn't me saying don't call the number if you are hurting.  i am not saying that it is a useless thing that shouldn't exist.  what i am saying is that just quoting it willy nilly to people who are hurting is a kin to trying to save someone who fell off a boat by just tossing the life saver ring out into the water and not holding onto the rope to pull the person back on deck.  maybe you gave them a little more time or a little break, but you sure as shit didn't rescue them.

"neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the two spaces in front of our home. after asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving all their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.. california here, getting that out of the way. and full disclosure, its not my home. the home belongs to my parents, but i house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus i love my parents and want what's best for them). i will just be saying my home or my driveway so i dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


these neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with all the memories. i thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

my parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. he has it parked in the middle so that it takes up all the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. it has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. why? i don't know. perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. all i know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

i want to also mention they have a full garage. they also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. and a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

i politely asked him to move his car when i saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. he followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. several days later i visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

i spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since i had asked him to move his car as payback. they said he's really mean and to just let it go. this did not sit right to me, so i later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. i explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

bad idea. i assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. i assumed mom would just tell 'billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. turns out he got it from mom and dad. i get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how i did not just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

i didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. my mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an fu to my mom and dad. that's also when their car got keyed

so since i made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. now the parents are retaliating too.they finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. the one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. the beater was moved so its parked on the other side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. sorry for the run-on sentence. did that all make sense? i hope so.

this has been going on for a few weeks now.

is there anything that can be done? my parent's just seem to want to let it go. not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. my parents travel a lot and my work makes it so i cant always be there to sit the house for them. they fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. i used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


tldr - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. the neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. parents fear retaliation.",2

"i shit in a mason jar and left it in my friends pantry.. here we go. 


about 13 years ago my 19 year old self was partying at a friends house. there was probably a good 20-25 people packed inside this 1000sqf house. 

i had been drinking mikes hard lemonade and tampon blender benders all night long. full disclosure; i have an allergy involving certain alcohols that can cause severe hives, swollen throat, and intense diarrhea. i was 19, and stupid. 

anyways, i was chatting with my gal pal at the time and felt the inevitable groan of my stomach. 

""shit"" i thought. figuratively and literally. 

i asked where the bathroom was, and she pointed down the hall. 

i squeezed myself through the teenage crowd only to find a ridiculously long line of women waiting to use the toilet. 

my bowels were screaming. 

the cramps were intensifying. 

i recalled seeing a toilet closet in the basement of the house once before and decided to take my chances. i darted down the stairs all while puckering my pooper with all the strength in me. 

it was dark so i flipped the light switch and saw the porcelain throne glowing in the corner of the room. i slam the door behind me and shove my pants down around my ankles. i make a swift penguin waddle over to the toilet. 

to my surprise, the toilet isn't connected to the plumbing! it's just sitting in the corner of the room. a failed attempt at a bathroom remodel, i had put myself in a perilous poo-position with no escape.  

people saw me come down here, there's no way i could poo in the toilet and get away with it. 

by now anus was on fire. i could barely hold it in much longer. 

i panicked. 

i scanned the room and noticed an open mason jar filled with potpourri with the lid laying beside it on a shelf. 

my mind was made up. 

i snatched the mason jar from the shelf and promptly dumped the potpourri into the empty toilet bowl. 

ever so carefully i placed the mason jar on the floor of the bathroom and popped a squat over it. spreading my cheeks and with surgical precision, i shat my brains out in that jar. i filled that sucker to the brim. i released the kraken of anal sighs and never felt such relief before in my life. 

but what now? what do i do? i can't leave it in here! 

i hear my friends calling me from upstairs that they were wanting to leave. i needed an escape plan, now! 

quickly i pulled up my pants (wiping was not an option, but i'd pinched off like 99.99% of my shit, so it was *clean enough*) and placed the lid on the mason jar. it was warm. so warm. still unsure of what to do next, i hide the jar under my hoodie and exit the bathroom as if nothing happened. 

""what were you doing down there?"" my friend asked. 

""just freshening up"" i said, in absolute horror that she may notice my mason jar shit smuggling. 

""hurry up, we're all in the kitchen waiting to leave"" she barks. 

i swim through the crowd of people to the kitchen to meet my friends. they're all crowded around the pantry door which was next to the door to the garage. 

""there you are!"" they holler as they open the door to the garage. 

here's my chance. the door to the garage was blocking the visual to the pantry. 

i did it. i slide the smuggled shit jar out from under my sweater and place it next to identical jars in the pantry. and promptly left with my friends. 

to this day, i wonder. i wonder with so much wonderment that i wonder how i've never been caught. 

did they ever locate this jar and open it? was it assumed beef stew? was it tasted? smelled? tossed? 

i regret this. but i was desperate. 

this is my poo-fession.

"meta at any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.. this seems like a really weird meta post, but i just wanted to warn people that captain sparklez, a youtuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole trails episode talking about this sub. it's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

it seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. the thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

this isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. honestly i knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds i know to this day. but it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

i *am* the asshole, i already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. sorry, teenagers, but i kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. i wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but i would also be looking at their advice differently if i knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

just be careful everyone. and please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. this doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes."" i just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",3

"for telling my mom she's a whore?. throwaway. long time lurker, first time posting. 

i am the oldest daughter of 4 children. i'm currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

when i was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. i, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

this has put a strain on my mothers and i's relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
she didn't even try to keep it a secret from the kids, i remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and i'd see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. as a kid i didn't understand, but as i got older i realized what she was doing in front of us and i feel sick. 

people ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this ""family friend"". they split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

i've confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. this was roughly 3 years ago. 

my mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. they exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. i read the messages and it's very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she's just catching up with an old co worker. but i know my mother, and i know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. i mean it's been years, why else would you want to catch up?

my new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn't agree with it, it's been years, he wasn't in her life yet.

she asked me what i thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. she asked for my honest opinion about the matter and i told her; 

""to be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy's marriage and you guys had 4 kids. idk why you think it wouldn't ruin this one, but why don't you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?""

she cried, said she couldn't believe i just called her a whore and left my house. we haven't spoken for a few days.

today, i got a call from my siblings saying i hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy's marriage was between them. i disagree, i had to witness my mom cheating on my father, i watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. she asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she's selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? sorry i'm not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",3

"by fucking my bf into a seizure. i'm going to preface this by saying, no, this didn't actually happen today. it has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.

it was our first valentine's day together this year. i woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.

i decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. it was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

i needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

this is when things begin to go wrong.

all of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. i glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (he has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


sure enough, he began to violently seize. i go full protective mode and try to help him. he was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

we're both still naked and i have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. 

fight or flight kicks in and i know i must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. i'm on the smaller side, being 5'6 and around 125lbs. so when my actively seizing bf (6'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, i go balls to the walls.

i grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting

*clack*


once he's back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it's dislocated. i drive him to the hospital
and sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. i apologized profusely to my man, who responded

""babe you fucked me into a seizure..i'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.""
so not only, on our first valentine's day together did i literally fuck him into a seizure, but i also dislocated his shoulder. 

tldr: had sex with boyfriend that had a seizure afterwards, tried to turn him on his side and dislocated his shoulder in the processs.",4
"i (14m) think i just had the cutest brother sister (17f) moment in school today.. so me and my sister have the same lunch and me and my friends had a big fight earlier that day so i didn't want to sit with them so i went and just sat a table that didn't have anyone there then my sister came over and said ""hey bud want to come sit with me and my friends"" i told her no i'm fine so instead of leaving and going back with her friends she just sat there with me i thought it was cute so i wanted to share it.",12
"i never knew one sentence could end a marriage so abruptly.. i (31f) have been married for 5 years. i love my husband very much, but lately hes been really mean and disrespectful. i can't talk to him about anything concerning us without him flipping out and getting mad. we haven't shared a bed in 3 years and our sex life is next to nonexistent. we don't communicate well and its just getting toxic. we have two children together, and i have an older son with my ex. 


when my husband and i argue it escalates quickly so i always try to remain calm. if it gets bad enough, i take my kids to my moms house until things smooth over. tonight, my husband pushed it too far and i'm seeking a divorce asap. we got into an argument because i was wiping down the counters and his phone went off. so i picked it up, took it over to him and said ""your mom just texted"". he flipped and immediately assumed i went through his phone. i didn't. i happened to see a text come in because he has his notifactions turned on (oops my mistake). 

i asked him why it was a big deal, and he said ""cause i pay the fuckin bill. stay out of my shit"". i'm spent at this point so i just walk away. i hear him mumbling under his breath and slamming things around so i go back. i asked him if its ok if i take the kids to my moms for awhile and he said fine. i let my daughter play with my phone on the way to my moms. by the time we get there, hes texted me going off and calling me names. unfortunately i'm used to that part so i just brushed it off. 

my oldest son from my previous relationship is autistic. i meant to mention that sooner. anyways, brushing off his earlier comments pissed him off so his texts started getting worse. then he sends me the worst sentence i've ever read. 

""have fun changing your sons diapers when hes 30"". my son is 11 and is still in diapers at night. i literally gasped when he sent that. i haven't responded. i can't. i have kids with my husband. i can handle him calling me names and shit, (handle, not like lol) but he crossed a line. i'm done.

"best advice my dad has ever given to me: (1) if you can't afford the monthly payments to pay off your car in 3 years, you can't afford that car. (2) after the car is paid off, continue paying your car payment into a savings account.. by the time you pay off the car, you've budgeted the car payment into your finances.  make it a direct transfer so that you don't give yourself the option to skip a payment.  my car has been paid off for 3 years and i have saved over $12,000 almost effortlessly by using this method. 

edit: this seems to be striking a nerve for many.  this post was written with the intention of helping those who wouldn't invest the difference with a longer loan.  it was meant to offer a simplified idea for saving that worked for me to work for others.   as with everything, there are always better ways to save and invest.  this was just the one that helped me out.  with that said, i've learned a lot by your comments, so thanks for posting!",11

"updatei (14m) have no connection with my mother(29f). my mom was raped. i don't know how to handle this.. i posted yesterday about my issue with my mom. i finally had the courage to talk to my mom about our relationship and i wasn't prepared for it.

we were alone and i just asked if she loved me. i called her mom for first time in months. i wanted to know what her feelings for me really are. i just ranted to her without letting her speak. how i needed her attention and it's affecting me. i played sports just for her attention and so that she would be proud of my achievements. i asked her why she wouldn't attend my awards ceremonies or attend parents nights at school. i would stay out late just so that she would call me. i flipped and told her she should have never had me. i fucked up.

i made my mom cry that night.

she told me that she did love me. 

she revealed that she was raped by my dad. he was her boyfriend at the time but she didn't consent. she became depressed and carried me full term. she is still recovering from her depression. my grandparents wanted her and i to be raised as siblings, in order for her to continue with her life. at first she tried to be a mother but it was really difficult raising me. this is why she has been distant from me. she doesn't know if she wants to be my mom or act as my sister. in the end she just gave up. i remind her of her rapist but she knows that i am gentle and kind. i didn't know what to say, i just hugged her. it was a hard truth to swallow. i told her that i will always be there for her. she told she didn't know i was hurting inside. i told her we can start again from scratch.

my mom joked that i scare away her boyfriends and she loves my cooking. i cried as i went to sleep. i can't blame her anymore and i should make a better effort to be more involved with her. i want to support her. i'm not going to break off contact with her. i going to try and persuade her to join me in getting some family therapy. 

i'll try my best to be a good son. thanks for the advice.

i wanted to ask if there was any advice on helping family members overcome depression.

edit: thank you for all the support. i will get my grandparents involved to search for a good therapist for my mom and myself.

"my wife tried to hide my daughter from me. am i wrong to feel this angry?. my wife and i are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

when i was in my 20s i donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (i literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). i've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. always. and she has always said she's okay with it.

fast forward to yesterday i answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" obviously i have no idea what the fuck is going on, so i ask her to explain what she's talking about.

turns out this girl is my daughter (i understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when i didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. after turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. she called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. apparently my wife told her that i wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman i loved could be so fucking heartless. so for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when i was home.

i tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that i did not say any of that. we organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night i blew up at her. honestly, i've never yelled at anyone as long as i can remember, but i couldn't hold it in. 

am i wrong to think that's so severely fucked up of my wife to do? i honestly can't comprehend how she could say that. i'm not thinking straight and need some advice on how to deal with this.",7
"my 26f girlfriend 24f thinks she's an instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy!. when i met my girlfriend 3 years ago, i knew very quickly she was addicted to instagram. she was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

this didn't really bother me at first - i actually found it kind of hot? mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - i felt, i guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then i think).

other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. every day is punctuated by ""insta time"" where i'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for instagram content... it's ridiculous. we've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, i'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. i'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

it was routine stuff, i asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

so the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. she desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. she's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but i didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for ig, she was actually trying to make money from it. i know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. before you say it - yes, i'm probably going to break up with her. but the thing is, she's got a really good heart and i genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). is there anything i can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",7
"update i have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! and my landlord's response was: ""if you don't like it- just move out!"". here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

i have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400cad a month) in my apartment in ontario, canada.

&#x200b;

based on all of the advice i received from the original post – here's what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200b;

**i managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* i noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month i was consistently consuming around 2600 kwh. no matter the month – no matter if i was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* i also checked the specific weeks where i was on vacation. i was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- i paid around $70 for each week i was away. a total of $140 i paid when i wasn't even home for two weeks!
* furiously, i called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* she also informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**the inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* i was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* the inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* the closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! feeding hot water to all the units.
* to prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

after emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. we noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). after he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. i had to shower at the neighbor's house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200b;

**yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to ""see what's going on.""** *my boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. he is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* my boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and fix this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven't already done enough).
* the landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said ""**if you don't like it- just move out!""**

**i am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* since my boyfriend and i are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with no hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**my question to all of you:**

1. what do i do now?... can i trust my landlord to 'solve' this issue on his own – even though his ""plumbers"" will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. what happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. do i need a lawyer?

thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

&#x200b;

***edit!***

* thank's to all of you who commented last night! - unfortunately the comments got locked before i could even reply to any of you! 
* i am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on monday!

"no regrets i conned my way into being a therapist. while on a plane a few months ago, a depressed business man that was sitting right next to me started talking about his problems and how he failed to find a good therapist. 'i would pay a fortune just to find a good one' he said before asking me what do i do. 

yeah, you guessed what i answered. after that he asked me if i accept bitcoin and if we can do it remotely on the phone. 'even better', i thought, just like that guy from 'catch me if you can'. 

after our first calls, the guy was so impressed with me, he told his friend about me. 

i was now dealing with 2 clients and the guilt started to creep in. after a month or so of 'therapy', i confessed to them both. they didn't care.

'you're the best', they said. 

my secret? i'm a hard core misanthrope. and oddly enough, this makes them extremely comfortable. nothing is too shameful to share (i already assume the worst about people), i look at life from the perspective of a detached observer (i'm objective in my analysis), i am a great listener (i barely talk, because i know that what they need is to vent, not to ask for solutions), i am  well read, i traveled the world, i made money etc (i can empathize with whatever they are talking about), i like listening (i find it very educational) and i sell no bs (i'm way to pessimistic for that sh\*t).

so yeah. they are bringing in a third client. it's my pleasure.",13

"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?. necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

&#x200b;

edit: while it is nice to know that i'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". i disagree as it was not my intent and i never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. he's also very mad about being called an asshole. while he is my son, i find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. i'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",3
"if i record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?. my neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the tv. i've gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. we have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. they also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. it's actually turning me off sex. i find them insufferable. 

 as petty revenge, i'm considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they're loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. i feel they know i'm mild-mannered, and they're taking advantage - that since i'm not a tough guy or something (i'm a young woman), they don't care.

"fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick. i'm so sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/haes movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. i'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but i'm well inside the 'normal' bmi range (bmi of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. i work out, i eat healthy, i have learned to control my urges and i take pride in taking care of my body. it irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  because of this, i find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me i'm curvy or thick. ffs, you're fat! if you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. rant over. 

edit: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why i care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. fat is fat. not curvy, just fat. there are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on youtube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). i simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations. but hey, if calling me insecure/a bitch makes you feel better, go ahead :) ",6

hi guys, i just wanted to give you a quick update about a post i made 5 days ago on here. you were very kind to me. thank you. it got locked and deleted because i had the wrong username so i've just made another account and added the ""throwra"" to my normal username lullabelleanabelle, so i can make a quick update for this subreddit. i'm not sure if i'm allowed to link to my post because i posted it on another subreddit too. a lot of you suggested i go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. thank you everyone. you're wonderful. 

to clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if i may). i'm not american, european born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. we met at his friend's wedding where i did the bride's makeup (i'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). we had some serious words, mostly where i told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and i fell hard. and you guys are so right, he is the best person i have ever met. he's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. and he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. so i think i'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. he's just my world. 

it hasn't been easy. a few things have happened and i can't honestly say that i'm better off for it. but i'm trying.  again, really not a troll post. i'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. this is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

i didn't know how to tell him. or what i wanted to tell him. a bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, i didn't want to show him ever. so, i told him i could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. they aren't particularly easy to read. those men weren't very nice to me. they had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. and they had gone to jail. 

he got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. that i didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if i didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second i was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. he'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. he wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. he said he was so scared that i would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. and he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. they were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. nothing malicious or accusing. 

i thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. she'd taken pictures of the parts where i described things that had happened almost too vividly and then i had pointed out ways i could have defended myself and questioned why i hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way i looked and wanting them to do those things to me. its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. it was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so i didn't have to think about the ways i could have stopped it. maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all i had, i never went to therapy. she put in her message that i had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof i was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

his sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. and to the other siblings and some others in the family. fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

things haven't been going well. my husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. he's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. he won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. he owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. but i'm trying to get him to not do that. it's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. i don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

as for me, i'm just in a fog. i don't know how to process what she did, so i'm not going to until i'm ready. my husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. i think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. i'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. it sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. i hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows i thought like that about myself. i never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. its just shit. 

i won't be posting on here again. 
thank you all for your lovely words. i hope you take care.

edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. and thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much i must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. no.",7
"by accidentally buying tickets to the red hot chili pipers not peppers. few years back i was a bit drunk and saw online that the ""red hot chili pipers"" were playing in edinburgh...i thought it was the red hot chili peppers! £30 for a ticket i thought it was a bargain! bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time).

i am a huge fan of the red hot chili peppers and i was super stoked to finally see them in edinburgh! most bands play in glasgow so i couldnt believe my luck when i saw they were playing in my city!

so we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then i heard some bagpipe music was playing.

i thought hmm interesting...not what i expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in scotland and the capital city i really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

about an hour in i was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but i was waiting for the red hot chili peppers to come out so i could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

i turned to the man next to me and asked when the red hot chili peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

it was at this moment i realised i was not going to see the red hot chili peppers.

tl;dr: bought tickets to the red hot chili pipers thinking it was the red hot chili peppers.

edit: changed ""bought two tickets one for me and one for my ex gf"" to ""bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time)"" to let redditors know i am now single and available.",4
"boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship. my bf and i have been together for over 4 years. when we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. we stayed together long distance until i graduated and moved back home. we have lived together for about 2 years now. 

life was very rough for him when he dropped out. his parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. he is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. because of this, i have lent him money over the years. i was very fortunate in my situation where i went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. i have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. one thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. i am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. he told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. my perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (for example, we moved last week and i wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) it makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. but he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

i am very confused about our relationship right now. he will not remember this when he wakes up, but i don't know how to approach him with the things he said. i love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. but if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should i be doing?

edit: i've changed the ocd to perfectionist. i'm so sorry to everyone i offended!

edit 2: i'm crying at work from all the supportive and caring comments. thank you to everyone who responded, i love each and every one of you, even the rude people because they probably don't get a lot of love in their lives. 

a little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn't work. because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. that was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job.",7
"update - for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. a few months ago, i posted this post( https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/achoyx/aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting_to_go_to/) asking if i was an asshole for not wanting to take my girlfriend out to restaurants. it blew up. it ended up on twitter. people shared it to facebook.

the general consensus was, yes, that i am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. a couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. more than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. 

well.

after i posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. she started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.

then one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, ""do you seriously fucking think that i *actually like* eating at olive garden?""

guys, she saw the post. she was *furious*. 

she doesn't like olive garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. i was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, ""she never developed a taste for pasta, she's latino, do i ever see her make pasta? no. a meal isn't complete without rice. you don't know me at all.""

she yelled about olive garden for a solid twenty minutes. it wasn't just about olive garden, but it was a lot about olive garden.

long story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. she ""loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage"" from me for her own personal betterment.

 so, yeah.

tl;dr: i ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. i didn't take her out on dates and i didn't pay enough attention. i would do anything to fix everything.

edit: to clarify a few things

1. i didn't post on april first.

2. i say that she yelled about ""mostly olive garden"" because she did. she was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over olive garden, where the kids are catered to.

3. she did not call herself latino. she calls herself latinx, but i thought latino would be less confusing. guess it just made me look like a dick.",3

"update: my babies and i escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3am last night... i'm scared, my kids are confused... i don't even know how i feel right now but nothing seems real.. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/av968z/my_babies_and_i_escaped_to_a_shelter_for_victims/

thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. i was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

a little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

the dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. my kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he ""loves his new house"". he asks for daddy nightly saying ""i just want daddy be happy. i just want daddy not be mad any more"" and it breaks my heart but i just tell him i love him and hold him when he is hurting. i realized even being here i am happier than i ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. i don't feel like i'm constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

the shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. my 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and i've seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

they have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. the attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. they are also filing a long term protective order. 

we have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

i will be starting work again next week. my hr manager contacted the store up where i am now to have me transferred because of the situation. i am so thankful the company i work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though i've had to take the last few weeks off while i get things in order. 

the shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on wednesday for both children while i start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. the daycare facility is wonderful and i'm so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while i start work again! 

since i am able to start work again too i was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

i was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. i was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

a detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while i handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. the detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. so, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a class c family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when i was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a class a and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

he has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying i kidnapped the children and also filed a false cps report. i handed over all evidence to cps as well and they immediately closed it saying they ""can tell he is not being honest"" as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. he did text me a few days ago saying we didn't need to get attorneys though and let's just go file a custody agreement, but i didn't respond. if i even let him see the children until things get worked out i risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

his mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to florida so i would never see them again.... 

so, things are moving along. it has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but i've never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. i feel like things are pulling together even faster than i imagined. it's stressful... by the end of the day sometimes i just want to cry still, but it's not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

i hope one day i can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources are available. it's not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what i ever could have imagined and hoped for and i will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing.

"my mother passed away from lung cancer 10 years ago. my dad just told me something about her that is just as terrible as her diagnosis.. a little background about me, i just turned 30 this past may, i just bought a house with my fiancee, of whom i proposed to on the day we closed on the house as a way to symbolically seal our relationship for good. it was a beautiful day, and to say i'm fortunate just isn't truly enough to describe it.

my family is small, but we're very tight knit as of late. my fiancee's family is massive and a little rambunctious. so in that, we find many differences. one of the key differences is that my family doesn't stay apart for very long. we try to interact often despite our busy schedules, and we're very open to each other, within reason.

i thought i knew everything about my mother. my mom and dad, my little brother and i lived a happy life together, my sister is 6 years older than me and she became independent quickly, so i didn't see her very often growing up. so us 4 lived like any normal family for many years, until near the end of my time in high school, when my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

she smoked cigarettes constantly. a pack a day, maybe more. for pretty much my whole life. and it didn't stop even when she was diagnosed. i was furious with her, but she was my mother. what could i have done?

she was too weak to see me graduate, and slowly withered away in a hospital bed at home. one night, my dad told me and my brother that her time was nearing its end, and he told us that it would be best to say goodbye to her. that night, we did. it was very anti climactic, almost as though we were totally prepared for it. i must have been, because a few nights later, it happened.

around 3-4 am, she died in my father's arms. my brother cried, but i didn't. i think i had made peace, but i still felt this depth that i never had before, i felt alone, because she was my best friend.

flash forward some 10 odd years and my dad is standing with me and my fiancee in our new kitchen, he tells us how proud he is of me and how well we've done as a couple, praising us left and right. this is a big deal to me because i've felt underwhelming as a son, as well as an older brother. as he's about to leave he stops and says ""you know, i wasn't sure if i should have this conversation with you and jake (little brother), but it just feels right at the moment. you and your future wife are off to a great start with your lives, and i figured i'd give you some insight on what it is to be married, to be there for your wife.""

he proceeded to tell me that, through most of his relationship with my mother, she struggled with an addiction to heroin. dad would find things missing from time to time, including money from his account, and knew that she was using just from looking at her. it went on for 15 years, and came to a head one night where she told my dad she didn't love him anymore, screaming at him to leave. he almost did, as he was about to walk out she stopped him, and begged him to stay. she apologized up and down, and from what he said, she detoxed in their bedroom, all on her own, over the course of a few days. he said after that it was like they fell in love all over again, that they hadn't been that happy since they met.

it would've been a beautiful ending, but then, cancer happened. we were on vacation in disney world, and she was weak. she barely participated with us, and once we got home, she went to the hospital, and was diagnosed right then. a year or so later, she passed.

i've never smoked, drank, or taken any hard drug in my life, and her cancer was the cause of it. knowing what else she went through has only further cemented my foundation.

thank you for reading, hopefully none of you have to endure something like this, reach out if this is happening to you, i'm sure someone will listen.",12
"for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?. so this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so i figured i would bring it to the group to see if i'm the asshole or not.

my boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  i absolutely hate it because i am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

for an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  we live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  we were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

a few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, i told my boyfriend that the event started at noon, not 1:00.  and just as i figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  we show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

so last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  i had lied about what time the event started.  i know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if i can lie about something like that, whose to say what else i'd be lying about.  i told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that i don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if i'm 'hiding something'.  i explained that i only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  in my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

he doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one i lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

i've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but i just have to know if i'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.

"good friend rapes my girlfriend while i'm in the house.. sorry for the format as i am typing this on mobile. this happened back in 2015, and to be frank, i haven't really been able to get it off my chest since. tldr is the title.

story is as follows:
we had been out to a good friends 21st birthday. all was going really well until the bar we were at closed and everyone there left for home around about midnight. a very good friend of mine was crashing at my house that night, along with my girlfriend of 3 years.

we got home, opened a few more drinks and continued the party - just the 3 of us. a few hours went by and i decided to head to bed around 3am. my friend and my girlfriend decided to stay up and keep drinking, which was totally fine by me as they could go off to bed at any point they chose.

fast forward 2 hours and i am awoken by my girlfriend in absolute hysterics. she jumps onto my bed and curls up in the corner, trying to tell me through her tears and hyperventilation that my so called ""friend"" had just raped her. it should be known that whilst i was trying to calm her and find out what she was saying, i could hear someone moving around downstairs which i assumed was my friend as we were the only people at home.

i curled her up in bed and told her to stay put. i then ran downstairs, through the family room and to the kitchen, where i see him entering the door, fully clothed and confront him. 

me: ""why is she upstairs telling me that you've raped her?""

him: ""what are you talking about? i've just gone for a walk and have been gone for an hour!""

me: ""then why is she telling me this? don't lie to me, you were the only people in the house!""

him: ""i don't know, she's just being stupid and making stuff up! why would you accuse me of this?!""

me: ""wait here and do not move!""

i head back upstairs and ask my girlfriend what she remembers. i trust her wholeheartedly but as she was drunk at the time, this is the bit i struggle with. apparently she had passed out from the drinking and been woken up with him on top of her, her trying to get him off and him forcing himself upon her, holding her mouth closed. 

when she managed to break free, she ran up to me and told me what had happened, whilst he quickly got dressed and ran outside to make it look like he wasn't even here.

i kicked him out of the house before i did something i would have regretted, and believe me i wanted to. 

the rest of the day consisted of police visits, forensic examination of the scene and tears. you can't even believe how many tears. the police wanted to press charges, but my girlfriend didn't want to. not once did i think she was lying, but i don't think she could have handled reliving it in detail in court. we had all the evidence we needed to press charges, including his dna from inside her.

fast forward to 2018 and we received a call from the police asking if my (now fiance) could testify against him in another court case. he had raped someone else, and this time would be going away. she refused, and i supported her, although it would have been good to see the look on his face as we stood in front of him with evidence from years prior.

these days we are still together, happily married, have bought our own house and are doing well financially. it still haunts me to this day what happened, and what i or her could have done differently to avoid it altogether or the aftermath. i don't think my wife is over it yet. she doesn't want to talk about it, and wants to deal with it in her own way. in my country, if you are a rape victim you automatically qualify for free counselling for the rest of your life. maybe she should take it up, maybe she shouldn't. i'm not sure. but one thing is for certain, i'll be beside her the whole way.

edit: thanks for the silver! also thanks so much for the 99% of you offering support and your kind words. unfortunately the last 1% just want to offer opinions and blame us for not putting this guy away. all i can say to you is that i truly hope this never happens to you or anyone you know, as acting rationally and with full focus under these circumstances is difficult to say the very least. to those of you wondering why we never pressed charges, it is because in a police interview he agreed that ""something"" happened. in court it would only become a he says/she says scenario and would have been difficult to prove to a jury that it was rape. 
in saying that, in new zealand the police themselves can press charges on a perpetrator if they feel they have a strong enough case, but as he agreed that something happened and was quoted in saying that it was consensual, it would have been difficult to put him away. he was put on the sexual offenders register and it went on his record.

"update: my landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. wtf do i do.. because i know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  you all helped break the cycle of panic.

original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  it was my roommate saying my landlord had said i couldn't hospice there.

yeah.  i know.

i specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding i would be dying in this house.  i'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  and i guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  so instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""you can't do in-home hospice here"".  


obviously this is super illegal (thanks, la!), and i call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

i started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after i threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and i call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what i was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

so yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because i subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  my attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  everybody wins?  

except i still gotta die, yo.  after i move lol.  at least i can afford it i guess.  :( 

thanks la.   ",2

"instead of making divorce easier, getting married should be made harder.. it's disgusting that people treat an age old tradition as simple milestone in their disastrous lives.  marriage is meant to be the everlasting and unbreaking bond between two people. it has been extended to societal and legal roles in the world which is not a problem. the problem is when people treat marriages as their casual relationships. getting married into a situation they know is unstable or doing it for stupid reasons or impulse. further problems come with divorce with the management of assets and children. none of this would have been a problem had they not been marked and there were obstacles to them completing it. these obstacles should mean that only people with a true intention to remain with their partner can be married.",6

"for telling my roommate that guys who go to porn conventions are losers?. i (26m) and roommates with (30m). let's call him mark. mark told me that he is considering to buy ticketed to a porn convention and my first reaction was to laugh. he asked why i laughed so i just explained.

i said that i can understand people who are in the industry who go, so men/women looking to further their career. but the dudes who go as fans that aren't in the industry are just weirdos and losers. i've seen videos/pics and they look just as you'd expect them to.

i think it's a bizzare and sad thing to actually be fans of pornstars to the extent to visit them at conventions..

"for being mad my girlfriend took my keys?. my lovely girlfriend and i have been together for 8 months. she slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

my issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student id to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

i asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my id on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. i told her that i didn't appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. we started to fight about it and i ended up asking her to leave.

since then, she hasn't answered any of my texts or calls. when i told my roommate about this he said that i was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and i yelled at her about it. i think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. aita?

edit: i thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, i get that she was being nice but why couldn't she have asked??

edit 2: and no she still hasn't responded to me

edit: i'm at work now obsessing but i know that i screwed up. i had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess i'm projecting or something. and no, my girlfriend hasn't responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money i tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it's early in my time zone

final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. i brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. we had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  she chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

"by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that i had to be rescued. then i did something really embarrassing.. 


a few years ago i spent a saturday blissfully tripping by myself. i had dosed that afternoon and i started coming down as the sun was coming up. it was a bright, crisp morning and i felt completely at peace. i was shuffling my music and sunday morning by the velvet underground came on. it was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

i suddenly made a decision. i had to make some changes. i had to get my fat ass to the gym.

i was surprised to see so many people. i had thought, hey, 7am on a sunday, i'll have the run of the place. i was obviously incorrect. all the cardio machines were taken. i couldn't just stand there. i was already getting sweaty and i'd been so high for so long so recently.

i saw an empty bench press and went for it. i couldn't remember what i used to bench back in school so i decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. i am 6'2 and 250 lbs. i was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

it was heavier than i imagined. i figured my guns were rusty. i decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. it was all i could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. i let it sit on my chest while i came up with a plan. every time i tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. i decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. with momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. perfect. i tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

the bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. i lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. if anyone heard it, they ignored it. despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. it hurt. i slowed my breathing and just relaxed. it'll be ok, i thought. i got this, i prayed.

*brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

nope, it's bad, this is bad. everyone had to have heard the rounds i let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. the volume was incredible. no one knew i was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. no one laughed. time was frozen but i assume only a few minutes passed. finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. he looked up at me with genuine concern.

""hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............whhhoooooooot.*

to his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. more like a twitch. i nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. i tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. he left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. all i wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. like i wasn't bothered at all.

so, knowing i was being observed, i did this. i stood tall, nodded to myself like i nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *alright*

**fuck.**

**me.**

the door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. i ran to my car.

i can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. there is nothing funny about the clap. it pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp. i just wanted to look like a normal human being.

tl;dr i went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak i am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until i was rescued. then i pretended i had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *alright* as if i could alter reality by sheer force of will.",4
"door dash added my business to their website without my consent and failed to mention it to me. i have a small but somewhat successful take away business in australia that does pick up and delivery. 
for the passed month or so door dash drivers have been coming into my shop and picking up food for customers. we finally picked up on it and i called door dash and to my surprise my menu ( which was incorrect, with food and prices ) were on there. i asked them how this happened and to take me down. 


they told me it was done automatically. they never asked me or informed me. i told them to take me down immediately. they said okay.

"in general, women are grosser than men.. i'm a woman. here's my reasoning.

i worked janitorial jobs for almost 10 years, in various settings. banks, doctor's offices, businesses, gas stations, etc. the women's restroom was always, 100% of the time, nastier. things in the toilet i can't even begin to describe. toilet paper everywhere. poop on the walls and the seats. spit and make up on the mirrors. and blood on everything. all the time.

in ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing i saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. i worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. and had money, and the women destroyed their bathrooms. sometimes i wasn't even sure the things i saw, came out of humans.

secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms i've been in, were women's. in female friends homes i've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

i've never seen worse than dirty clothes on a man's bedroom floor.

women are far nastier than men.",6

"by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong'. this happened about a week ago. it still gives me shivers.

obviously, i never thought this would happen to me of all people.

i spent a lot of money on the app store and i think they blocked my card and so i had to call them up to restore my account.

a female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. even at this point i had no clue what was coming. until she asked,

""what is your most prized possession?""

i froze. my head goes blank not because i forgot what i had written for the answer, but because i knew exactly what i had written. the answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

i wanted to hang up right then and there, but i knew she was looking at the answer i had written.

so, i mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""i'm sorry? you have to speak up sir, i can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (fuck), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (fucking kill me)""

""dong schlong. thank you, sir.""

i was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

i've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and i had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

edit:

holy mother of schlong this blew up... thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

and yes, looking back, i should've definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. but this had never happened to me and i think i just panicked. i'll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.

"wa my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. is there anything i can do?. hi, so my life is falling apart.

as the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. they have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. i love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and i would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

she has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. i don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. the reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but i know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. as a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

i was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. i opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. i told him that if he did end up having custody i would want to be seeing her as often as possible as i consider her my family. he told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. i don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that i am too as a result. i slammed the door. i was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

so basically, i have a few questions:first, can anything be done to stop him having custody? there are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research i have completed.

third, at the very least, could i contend in a court that i have visiting rights to her? i'm not actually related to her, so i'm not sure what the standing is there.

third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway i can straight up adopt my step sister? i have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, i have an apartment of my own, and i would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**edit: i want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

"ks sister (19f) woke up during a colonoscopy. sister tried to bring up her upsettedness, doctor told her he ""didn't have a pill to cure being a dramatic young woman"".. basically what the title says. my mother took my sister to the doctor to drive her after. 

sister goes in for a colonoscopy. she wakes up during the procedure. she admits she was kicking up a fuss, she was too sedated to actually verbalize her pain so she basically just screamed/cried. she could hear the doctor telling the nurses ""this sometimes happens during the procedure, it's just the body's response. i know it's upsetting but she's not awake and can't feel anything"".

when it's over and my sister is back in her room, my sister told my mom what happened (she was still crying and extremely upset, it was painful but also terrifying to not be understood by the doctors). the doctor came in to tell them how it went, and immediately launched into this speech about ""yeah sorry she's crying, all young women do this. it's called 'being a teenage girl', we see it all the time here."" my mom says ""uh she's saying she was awake during the procedure.""

the doctor had this look of shock on his face. he kind of rambles for a while and then jumps into this thing about ""well her blood pressure was getting too low so we couldn't give her any more sedation."" my mom said ""alright... but she's in a lot of pain here, is there something we can do about that?"" the doctor literally said ""if i could give you a pill to cure being a young woman, i would. but i can't, so she's all yours mom"" and he left.

the nurse was horrified and said ""you should not be seeing this doctor again"". the nurse apologized a bunch and gave my family a referral to a new doctor.

we're going to file a complaint with our state regarding his comments about not having a pill to cure being a young woman. is there anything else we should be doing?

edit: i've gotten some helpful comments, but i want to clarify that while the waking up during a colonoscopy (and yes, she was supposed to be asleep during that time - i do know that they're often performed awake but this one was not supposed to be done that way) is upsetting, we're all mostly upset about the fact that he ignored my sister's pain/discomfort because she was ""a young woman"".",2

i've been living with my mom who has mental issues and was basically a ticking time bomb. today we had a small argument and she suddenly went absolutely insane. i'm going to spare the details but if you were to listen to the breakdown from outside you'd think someone was being murdered. her breakdown is over but she says ""she's done with everything"" and is leaving the apartment so that the rent will not be paid. we'll likely soon be evicted anyway because of the damage to the apartment.
so that's the situation. i need advice on how to get through this... for reference:

i have no money for at least a week. we have always been extremely poor, living paycheck to paycheck and often that wasn't even enough, etc. my mom (when she was being normal) told me to quit my job last year and focus on school, so i did.

but, i did get a job this week to pay for school transportation, but since i just started i barely have any weekly hours and my paycheck is at least a week away. but i'd like some tips on what to do once i get it.

i'm enrolled in a massage therapy school and i have a student loan taken out for it, so leaving is not an option. but everyone is very nice there so i can probably ask for some help there on monday.

i've seen others like me come here in a crisis. if you know any subreddits i should x-post this to please let me know, i'll be checking my notifications as i pack my stuff.

i typed this up fast so i'm sorry if some things aren't clear, i'll reorganize this later. thank you for reading.

edit 1: thanks to everyone who has advised me so far. unless there's a better idea or a reason not to, it's looking like joining the military is the best choice for me. i've got no family, and my friends don't even live on their own yet. my new job is not giving me nearly enough work hours to live off of. i don't have much wiggle room, unless i can convince my boss to give a brand new guy full time hours. if there's any advice about this choice you can offer, please do.
