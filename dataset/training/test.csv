"for not shaving my legs for work?. so i'm a 21 year old female. i feel like i should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out i rarely shave my legs. i'm straight, i'm very feminine, and i just don't like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. also i'm not a hairy person at all! you can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. the only time i shave is when i'm dating a new guy in my life and i've been with my current bf for 3 years now. also he doesn't give a rats ass if i shave my legs. 

so i work for a promotion company where i travel and work at event and festivals. but today i had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so i stoped to say hi before i left out. 

when i ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. i said sure and came in and he shut the door. he was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. i was in literal shock. i was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. my boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained i didn't shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that i wasn't being hygienic. i was even more shocked. 

i told him i didn't understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. i asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. i then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this i'd prefer hr to be there and he just told me that we didn't need to discuss it any further. 

later today i just got an email from hr saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. i'm freaking out and it's making me so anxious.
for not shaving my legs for my job?

edit: so people giving my boss hate i understand but i'm not mad at him and don't blame him. im not sure but i feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn't even force dress code and stuff. but also i really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since i've worked there 8 months with no incident.",3
"america should forget their tipping culture and just set a minimum wage for servers.. as someone outside the us, this is something i couldn't understand with your country (aside from your healthcare and guns). yes, i know that servers aren't getting paid properly, that's why the tips. but why don't you guys standardise the wages of your servers so even if the servers have lots of karens (who don't tip well) during the day, they're still paid by the hours of their service.

"an 18 year old italian girl tells her mom that she has missed her period for two months. very worried, the mother goes to the drugstore and buys a pregnancy kit. the test result shows that the girl is pregnant. shouting, cursing, crying, the mother says, ""who was the pig that did this to you? i want to know!"" 

the girl picks up the phone and makes a call. half an hour later, a ferrari stops in front of their house. a mature and distinguished man with gray hair and impeccably dressed in an armani suit steps out of the of the ferrari and enters the house. he sits in the living room with the father, mother, and the girl and tells them: ""good morning, your daughter has informed me of the problem. i can't marry her because of my personal family situation but i'll take charge."" 

""i will pay all costs and provide for your daughter for the rest of her life."" ""additionally, if a girl is born, i will bequeath a ferrari, a beach house, two retail stores, a townhouse, a beachfront villa, and a $2,000,000 bank account. if a boy is born, my legacy will be a couple of factories and a $4,000,000 bank account. if twins, they will receive a factory and $2,000,000 each. however, if there is a miscarriage, what do you suggest i do?""

"(update) my husband's m32 ""sabbatical"" has become pathetic and i f30 want it to end right now.. first, thanks to all who responded to my prior post. a lot of good advice that has helped me navigate this situation.



on the day i made my last post, my husband and i had a talk that night when i got home from work. i basically said he needed to make a doctors appointment for his mental health, or cut out the marijuana use, or both. he repeatedly refused and actually got a bit hostile about it, which is not like him at all.



then i moved onto finances. i asked him how much of his savings he had left, and all he said was ""enough"". i pressed him for a dollar figure and he wouldn't answer. i asked if he had a balance on his credit card and he said no. when i asked to see his bank statement to confirm, he basically told me to fuck off -- again, hostile and out of character for him.



i told him that the current arrangement wasn't working, and that he'd have to start paying 50% of the bills on march 1st. at this point in the conversation, he completely shut down. he wouldn't even look at me, he just sat looking away from me with tears in his eyes as i talked. i doubt he even heard a word i said, but i clearly stated all the other issues i had -- the instagram stuff, our plans for the future, etc. 



after this conversation, he stopped sleeping in our bed. for almost a week now he's slept in the basement. he basically doesn't leave the basement when i'm home unless it's to get food. honestly, it's pathetic.



i am going out with some colleagues this weekend for a fun night, and my husband can stay home like a hermit. i also have a coffee date planned for sunday with my best friend -- i am going to tell her everything and get her opinion. because honestly, this isn't the life i want to live and trying to correct it only made things worse. i am beginning to think of divorce as a real option, which would have seemed outrageous even 3 weeks ago.



thanks again for reading and giving your input. ",8

"""you can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea..  let me preface this by saying i do believe in being grateful for what you have. but there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. i hate this for several reasons.

1. the people who say this almost never have it worse. they are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. i have a disability that limits my ability to walk. i don't complain about it much but i've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. i'm aware of that, but i've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. by the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. complaining solves problems. now, i can't speak for everyone with a disability, but i personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. in fact, i'm probably the best person you can complain to. i've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and i grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, i might be able to help. 

4. also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. so even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. look it up.

5. those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if i do it right. after all, isn't that what protesting is? complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. it's used to silence people who need help. i don't think i need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. it's human nature to complain. it just is. 

just something i had to get off my chest, thanks.

"my ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), i was starting to heal until i found out the reasons why he ghosted.. the past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. i'm not sure if i'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

my ex, 'tom', and i had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so i thought. we had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). i was happy, and i thought he was too. we had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, i could go on. 

everything was fine until our last trip together. we went to a destination where i had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something i'd have to wait longer to do. it was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

after we landed (the last time i saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. i didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. i tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. i started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. from there our communication basically broke down. i can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. from that point i'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. after about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then i wouldn't hear from him for several more days. what hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with new years, valentine's day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

i felt like i was going crazy. i had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  i was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. i stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. i found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse i could think of whenever i showed up somewhere without him. 

i eventually broke down, i contacted one of his good friends who i felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. i told her that tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and i have no idea what's going on. i told her i didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that i needed to know about. she looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and i that i was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. this was soul crushing to hear and i felt humiliated and worthless. i told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. she said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

throughout march and april i felt like i was starting to heal some. i felt broken, but i started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. i told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. then i found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

he had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. not sure how long, but a little less than a year. i'm also hurt because i know the person he cheated on me with. she's an absolute garbage person. and i'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. she has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. i've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the lgbt community and non-christians. she is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. she somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. i think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, i'm really not sure. i can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. i've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. her parents have paid for her car and i think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. she spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and i frequent and will interject herself into our outings. she has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew i wouldn't approve. then he started to get high and then have sex with her. he felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. his intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. this woman hated my guts, and kept pushing tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. he didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. so she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. he came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

i only found out about this, because the same friend i had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that i deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. there is no way in hell that i'd get back together with tom
2. i can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and i'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

i don't know what to do at this point. i'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. i don't know if i could contain my urge to slap him, or if i would just break down and sob. i was doing well from moving on from him. i was starting to feel happy again. now, i think i'm back at square 1. i'm depressed and stressed out. 

is there anything i can do? i kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",8

"aita? my husband and i are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. his mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but i don't want to do that.. my stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and i decided that we will be getting him a car. i make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. that's fine with me.

his mother is a woman who i make the effort to be civil with but don't like. i am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. she called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. we are not friends and i won't even describe her as nice to me.

when my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

i don't want to do that. i don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. i don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but i don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

i don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. and i don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

i know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. i'm civil to his mom and i never talk negatively about her to him. is that not enough? am i incapable of being a good step mother to him if i'm not best friends with his mom? do i have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",3

"for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?. background: i graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. my sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. we both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. i pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

this is a throwaway and it's still fresh and i'm really emotionally charged right now. last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. i overheard and i offered to help by paying more in rent (i was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. my parents were grateful. now, prior to this, i never asked my how much sister pays in rent. i always figured my parents charged us the same. so absentmindedly i asked a follow-up question.

me: how much is my sister paying for rent?

my mom: nothing.

a long ass pause.

me: what do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

my dad (visibly angry): your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

my dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. she doesn't pay rent. she doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. so for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while i've been paying my parents.

so later that night we had a family sit down talk. my sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much i was paying. she offered $100. my parents suggested she pay $300, i pay $800 which my sister and i both rejected.

the conversation ended with this:

sister: **fuck you. i'm trying to live my life.** these were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

so my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. i'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. my mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

so i say my part before leaving.

me: i'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (it's only fair right?) and if i do pay rent, i pay whatever she's being.

my mom: what if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

me: no.

my mom: but me, we really need the money...

me: that's too bad.

i get up and go off to my room.

so this morning my dad comes in tells me that i'm an asshole for not paying rent. that i should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. i'm like, ""what the hell? make my sister pay rent!""

my mom, who's listening in.

""you've seen her! she won't listen to us!""

me: well that's too bad.

my mom (really angry): well we wouldn't have this problem if you didn't try to make your sister pay rent.

that was the last straw that blew it for me. i slammed the door on my parents.

"for telling my friend i didn't appreciate paying for a $200 meal at her husband's birthday party?. my friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. the party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. we've been working on some remodeling projects, so we've been on a strict budget. my husband and i wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.

when we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. when we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. i asked a passing waiter if i could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. the waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.

my friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but i was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.

as the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend's husband with the check. my friend's husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, ""i know this isn't how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. we told you that."" i suddenly started panicking inside. i was trying to catch someone else's eye to see if they were panicking as much as i was. one other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. i opened the check, and the total was $211. i thought i was going to throw up. i have never spent that much on a meal.

i held my shit together because i didn't want to make a scene. the couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn't paying. they said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.

i ended up messaging her and said, ""thanks so much for inviting us to \*\*\*'s party. we had a great time. just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. we are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. thanks again.""

my friend said, ""sorry! should have given you a heads up. glad you came."" and we haven't spoken or hung out since. i've tried to set up coffee dates and girl's nights but she just bails or never responds. it's been almost 3 months, and she doesn't seem to want to talk to me at all.",3

this is still fresh in my mind as i'm typing. i take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. today was just a routine visit. my folks live in the country and don't have trash pickup so i visit with dad while driving their garbage to the dump. as we are talking i bring up a video i had seen and suggested i share it with him. he agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests i find the video while he does something else. 

commence fuckup. 
my dad has an older model desktop pc that is quite temperamental and only likes to use google chrome. i go to open a window and see that my dad has 20+ tabs open. all of them were different profiles on fetlife. for those who don't know, fetlife is like myspace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). i just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. unfortunately the tab i opened chrome to was my parents profile page. i not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; i also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. so now, not only do i know my parents are pretty kinky, i also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a christmas turkey.

"for going to the police over a 'prank'. throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

to preface this, i (24f) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. i have not eaten meat since i was roughly 3-4 years old when i found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). this is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so i thought. 


four nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" to which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong. 

i found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends snapchat story. the story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where i asked if it was vegan). the and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when i found out i ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the chickens!!!""). i took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

they all think that i'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so reddit, aita? in my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. in their view, it was just a prank.",3

"update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. i'm back after 6 months.. you can read my old post here: florida: parents hired people to kidnap me. my brother ended up pointing a gun at them. what do i need to do to get emancipated?(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i sadly don't have any good news. just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. the camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

the place wasn't like anything i imagined it would be. i tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. they also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. whatever you do they see it as resistance. their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. even when i was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. it took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that i'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. i got to the point that i didn't care about anything anymore, i just wanted it to end.

they knew about my youtube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. they had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if i truly hate my old self or not. she'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also youtuber) and i was supposed to agree with her, if i took things personally they knew i was acting and wasn't ready.

they got me when i was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. the next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. i was thinking all the time and effort i placed there was gone.

from there i didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. so things became easier. they'd teach me to be a nice girly christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. it was like they were sending me into a children's book. then my dad came and brought me back home.

when i got back my brother actually told me that my youtube account wasn't deleted. since i was using his email for recovery he got a notification when i logged in from the camp because it was a new place. so he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. so my account is intact. the assholes at the camp were lying.

i don't know if i'm the same person or not or how much i've changed but i really hate my parents. i hate them so much that a year ago i couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. there are 448 days until i'm 18 and i'm counting every single day until this is over and then i'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

my big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who i trust. when i was gone he went to police, cps, even talked to a lawyer and a pi to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. my parents came after my $15,000 which i had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. but my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. he continued to post the videos that i had prepared in the pipeline when i was gone so i continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

that's it for me. from what i understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",2

"tifu by loudly telling a female workmate i was going to finger her. so i (m 22) work in a factory that is slightly short staffed, so from time to time some of the office staff have to come through to the factory and help out. one of these office workers is a (f 18) who we'll call jess. so jess was in the factory helping out and i happened to walk past her wearing some rubber gloves. now jess and i have a friendly bit of banter from time to time, and so as i was passing her she looked at my gloves and said 

""you look like you're about to go finger a cow""
(which is a bit of a weird thing to say, but hey ho) 

so me being the master of wit that i am instantly thought ""right, now's my time to shine! if i say the right thing i could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow""
my brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was

""i'll finger you""

not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
because of the level of noise i  the factory i have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. it just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
at this point i wanted to just crawl into a hole, but i stood my ground and tried explaining myself

""i meant that as though you're a cow, not that i actually want to finger you""

this seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
i can't look jess in the eye any more. works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

tl/dr:  female workmate said i looked like i was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response i said ""i'll finger you."" now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references

"i called 911 for a medical emergency and the police showed up and verbally harassed/threatened me. should i file a complaint? (pennsylvania). i don't really know where to file this under flairs.

tonight, i had to call an ambulance to my apartment. my boyfriend was acting erratic and seemed to be in psychosis. he then had a full-on seizure. 

later on, i found out he smoked synthetic marijuana. i don't know much about that. i do not do drugs. i do not even smoke normal marijuana. i called an ambulance because i didn't know what else to do - i was scared. 

three policemen showed up first and entered without knocking. asked where he was. i started to cry and they told me to go in the other room as i was annoying them. i complied. then, the larger of the three cornered me in the hallway.

he said my pupils were completely ""blown"" and i better start telling the truth about what drugs i do. i told him that i have incredibly poor eye sight and my pupils have been naturally large since childhood - this is true. he told me, ""stop fucking lying to me now or you're getting arrested for drug possession."" again, i denied any drug use and told him he could literally drug test me through blood and urine at that exact moment - i am clean. he left me in the hallway and another man came out, rinse and repeat. then the third did the same thing. they kept telling me to look at lights and laughing and saying i was the biggest liar they had ever met. at this point i'm amped up and scared. i am a 23 year old woman. i am in nursing school. i do not do drugs.

at this point, they have the ems there coming or and checking my pupils and laughing. they were telling my boyfriend that he better rat on both of us or we were both going to jail. they ripped apart my whole entire room and starting laying into me for having cipro prescribed (an antibiotic). the largest policeman then told me he was going to speak to my landlord and have me evicted.  i reiterated that i am completely clean and could pass not only a field sobriety test but a drug test of any kind. he retorted with ""i highly doubt that"" as he continued to tear apart my home.

eventually, they got my boyfriend into the ambulance and all three of the cops left laughing. the largest turned around and said, ""congratulation on ruining your life. don't call an ambulance when you are on drugs, i'll see you around"".

not only am i shaken, but i feel threatened and ashamed. the man i was with should not have been on anything, but i called an ambulance because i was scared he might die! i didn't call them to be harassed. did they even do anything really wrong that i can report this? we live in a small town in nepa. i know that they heard a possible drug incident over the scanner and had three of them show up because they thought they'd find a good amount of drugs/an incident of interest. they found absolutely nothing. no one got arrested or charged. they also refused to give me any badge numbers and told me if i kept inquiring i'd be in more trouble.

"by suggesting to my bf that he get testicle implants. i've been dating this guy for a few months. he has a fetish for petite asian girls, that i know. but he also has a thing for big breasts, which i attribute to his ""hentai porn"" fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. 

in the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. he would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me i'd be ""perfect"" if i got some saline implants to fill a dd cup, as a ""joke"" of course. (dd is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34c, but still insulting to me.)

so i finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. i told him most petite asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. he did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great i'd look in a double d while we were out having brunch. 

so i snapped, and i said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. well he didn't take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. he hasn't returned any of my texts since. 

tl;dr: i underestimated how fragile my bf's ego is concerning his balls and i insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.

edit/update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. i tried calling him to apologize since he's ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(

more edit: i'm very sorry if i gave the wrong impression of him here. words are very limited. he really is a good guy otherwise. i know and i hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. but i really like him (and his balls big or small!). i did not mean to hurt him this deeply and i'm just so sad right now that i hurt him this much. i feel like a terrible person. i shouldn't have reacted with cattiness that i didn't even mean because i like his balls just the way they are!

one last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies. not sure where this will go but i guess i'll see.",4

"31m husband cheated on 27f me with his fit and skinny gym friend. i came home from work early (i'm an ob nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. at that point, i sort of already knew what i'd be walking into. my husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. she's beautiful and thin and everything i am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. so, i talked to him about it. he encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

i walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. they were having sex. in our bed. with a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. i silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and i've returned to the hospital. he called me asking why i wasn't home and i told him my shift is extended but in reality, i'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as i type this.

i feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. i don't even know how to proceed. on one hand i want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, i'm an ugly woman....its not like i can do better. i just want to die. i feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. advice please.

edit: thank you all for the kind comments and support. please stop commenting, however. i think i've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). i don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. i still have no idea what i am going to do and i know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. he was a great husband and i can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. i don't know if i will stay, but that's all i really know right now.

"a 15 year old girl made false allegations to cps about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter.. my daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. i don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know i was talking about them. 

the girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... she just has delusions of grandeur). the mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

i will refer to the mother as lorrie and the daughter as katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying katy. the assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss katy. i'm not sure if lorrie had anything to do with the cps report but i can not contact her directly. lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. i tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. my daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that katy said and i advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. when the friendship fell apart, katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. my daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

one of the things katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and i remembered it pretty vividly. my daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

a few days ago, cps knocked on our door while i was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what katy was saying about him at school a few months ago. there is no one else who could have made this complaint. it was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. my husband said the cps employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. i wasn't there so i don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

the problem is i have no proof. the assistant principal at my daughter and katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around katy when she made these comments about my son so i might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

what should i do? is there anything i can do? do i even have a leg to stand on? all i have is my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids. 

any advice is welcome. i'm terrified.

i am in va.

edit: i'm not looking to sue anyone or anything. i just want to clear all of this up and i want katy to be held accountable for making a false report. the things she reported could potentially hurt my son's reputation and damage his future. the allegations were not about me or my husband being neglectful or abusive. they were accusing my son of doing horrible things that he did not and would never do.",2
"reddit is not a bastion of free speech, and is actually highly censored by the wrong people.. hear me out.

i originally came here because i heard that reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. that was a lie.

subreddit communities can make lists of rules and whatnot to make clear what kind of things they don't want on their sub, and that's okay.

the problem with the rules and independent moderation of reddit is that, subs are just using their lists of rules as generalizations which in turn become excuses to censor people who don't agree with them. 

generally, once you start talking about things that rustle the mods' jimmies, they will ban you. it doesn't matter if you've broken one of their rules or not, they'll just pick the rule they think is closest to what you're saying and use that as their excuse. worse yet, sometimes they don't even give a reason, or they flat out admit they just don't like what you're saying. 

most moderators just want safe spaces. they usually don't even want a safe space for their audience, they just want safe spaces for themselves, because god forbid you post something they disagree with in their subreddit, whether  you're breaking the rules or not, they'll find a reason to get rid of you.

all of this is made worse by the fact that generally the ones censoring are heavily liberal, as most people that use reddit are. (being liberal is okay, i'm a moderate, so i don't really care). both sides of the political spectrum have both good and bad ideas, but only a weak person would try to censor everything that doesn't agree with their liberal agenda. i've seen conservatives do it too. just not as much. sometimes the censorship isn't even politically motivated, people just get butthurt.

the icing on the cake is that reddit administrators are extremely liberal and will always 100% side with mods, especially if they're trying to create a safe space. 

reddit puts on this mask of ""the last bastion of free speech on the internet "" when in reality they're creating the biggest censorship atrocity on the internet. i have faith in time it will die.

censorship will kill reddit.

safe spaces will kill reddit. 

cancerous moderation will kill reddit.

admins who side with the more socially acceptable will kill reddit.


edit: by ""moderate"" i'm saying that i'm in the middle, i base my political beliefs on what i think is right, and i don't agree wholeheartedly with either party. both have great and terrible beliefs. i go with logic and empathy over blindly siding with one side of a spectrum. i'm pretty sure that's what moderate means, but some people seem to think moderate is something else. i'm just clearing that up.",6

"for using the 'hidden' women's bathroom stalls when there's a long line?. okay this is so stupid and i really feel like i'm nta but my friend is adamant that i am so i'm seeking reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

my girl friends and i were recently at canada's wonderland and having been there dozens of times since i was a kid (am now in my 20s), i know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

so basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

well, for the last few times i've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and i always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. there never is and i use the bathroom stalls there. on my way out i'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

my friend now thinks i'm selfish and rude for doing this. she thinks that i should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

i don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

my friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. this is something i truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, i'm starting to question if she's right?

please tell me if i'm wrong, seriously, i don't get it. 

tl;dr: apparently i'm an asshole for utilizing bathroom stalls that nobody ever uses because they don't know they're there.

edit: this is epic.. i really never thought or could have imagined a post like this could get so much attention. thank you to everyone that replied. i'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

"by leaving my ear tubes in for 13 years and not realizing my hearing was going to be different when i took them out. happened this week and i just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and i felt inspired to share my own story.

context: i've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. my childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as i fought them off, and surgery. i've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. my mom and i honestly lost count because there were just too many. my last tube set was put in when i was in 5th grade i believe. i was around 10 or 11. 

i've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. in fact they've helped a few times! i feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. it's awesome. 

so here's where the issues started. 4 months ago i started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. i ignored it because at this point in my life ent doctors give me a lot of anxiety. but the symptoms started getting worse so last month i bit the bullet and went in. i saw the same doctor i had seen and a child. i couldn't believe he was still alive! he told me i developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. i knew this day would come so i agreed.

my surgery was last thursday and immediately post op i realized things were off. my ear popped more times than i could count and i realize i feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. my hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. usually i blast my damn music in my car but now i drive around at 6 volume. and finally my voice has changed. the way i sound to myself it's completely different to what i've come to know over the course of my life. i can't really tell if i'm whispering or shouting just yet because i've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. the kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. i guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! i genuinely did not. 

parents: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood.

"my (18m) girlfriend (f17), is threatening to kill herself every time i express discomfort, and today when i got angry at her and ignored her texts, she sent me videos of her cutting herself. i feel extremely trapped at this point. she was such a great person when i met her and i thought we would be great together.

unfortunately, for the past month, she's started to insult me for everything. for example, i could not hear a line of what she said over facetime because of internet issues and she flipped saying i don't pay attention to her. proceeded to call me names or whatnot. usually, i just took and it moved on. however, today i just snapped and told her to leave me alone. so i proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and i check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

i just ignore it because i really did not feel like it.  then she tells me she's bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. i honestly think i'm traumatized from those videos, i can't seem to get them out of my head and i feel responsible for them. i texted her father, however it was late so he's asleep. thankfully she's still alive and i've managed to calm her down by apologizing, but i don't feel right. 

i feel trapped, and very fucking sad. i feel as if i'm a monster and i'm causing her to do these things to herself. i never say anything badly to her, i just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. i apologize for my rant but i don't know. my emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

i hope i can get some advice. for some insight, i don't ever insult her, not even jokingly. she gets annoyed that i don't give her attention, but i text her and hang out with her as much as i can possibly give, i am human and a student with responsibilities, i can't spend 24 hours with her.  

that's really all.

just a slight update. i have been in contact with her father and i am being updated on what's happening. they are seeking professional help for her and i feel that is the right choice for her. i am very exhausted and haven't really slept, so i'll try and give updates as i can. fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm. in my case, i've decided it's going to do me harm if i continue keeping her in my thoughts and anywhere in my life. 

my mental state was much more positive and happy before this, and i'd much rather regain my positive nature. i am very appreciative of everyone in my messages expressing their own dealings with similar circumstances. i've read every story and the decision i made has been influenced by your own experiences. i will try and reply to all the messages, but i apologize if i miss anything. i'll keep you guys updated if anything new comes up. i have decided to move on with my life and and get therapy to help me through this, and i hope she comes to see what i chose to do a few years from now.

thank you!
if my spelling or grammar sucks, i'm pretty exhausted, i apologize.

"for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.. i have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that i hang out with almost every day. we've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, john. 

i never really liked john. he was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. he was also incredibly pretentious. a friend of mine said ""einstein"" once and john interrupted him to say, ""i have no idea who you are talking about. do you mean the reknown scientist albert einshtein?"". i once put up a snapchat story saying, ""i love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""it's called gridiron you moron"".  i don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

on one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. john was kind of tipsy. we had some new girls show up so i was kinda working my charm on them. they asked me what i did and i went ""i'm a biomed engineer"". i don't know why that triggered john so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how i'm just a drone in a rat race. he kept telling me about how i'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. he later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

every time i mention work or anything, john would start roasting me. he nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though i expressed multiple times that i dont like to be called a drone. he would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what i do. that really pissed me off. once i told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""what are you going to do, fight me? i dare you to swing"". i didn't want to fight him so now i started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

over the last few months or so i kinda went frontpage a couple of times on reddit and everyone was like, ""damn m0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). that triggered him even more. he'd say stuff like ""his posts suck. they're not even funny. reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


at this point it is relevant to bring up what john does. he's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at starbucks. how good is he? honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a dslr, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. i'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an instagram post about how national georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. at the party, i apologized to him (i hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""i'm sorry you didn't get nat geo"". to which he got angry again and said, ""i'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. what i'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so i actually feel sorry for you"". he said stuff like this in front of a girl i was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

that's it. i fucking lost it. we were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with john and i took that opportunity to say, ""well john, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder nat geo rejected you. you're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iphone camera. you're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *i get cut off here*"" 

his dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. john came charging at me but everyone just held him back. the rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and i got kicked out. no one has talked to me since the incident and john blocked me from all social media. our group chat has been pretty silent too. john also apparently made a roast post about me. idk if i should apologize to him or not. sorry for the long post. i know john is an asshole, but aita?

"by masturbating in front of my entire family. this happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which i was extremely anxious about. all together, i was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager i am, i often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

so, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, i lay down in my living room with my family, watching tv. i dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since i had done next to no study at the time). 

not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, i decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

and so off i went. except i forgot one thing.

i was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that i was not in fact sitting with my family by our tv, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

i don't really understand how or why it happened. a few seconds in and i began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

i snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment i put myself in. 

i'm not going to talk about what happened next, as i don't want to relive the next few moments.

my father is just disappointed. he hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

my mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as i write this. 

and i'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. i find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe i was just dreaming while i was gassed up. 

but it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

not a fuck up that just happened, but one that i just realized happened. 

this christmas season, and like the last few, i did almost at all of my shopping via amazon. for friends and family that live far away i had their gifts shipped right to their house.

after spending more that i should this holiday season i haven't felt the need to buy anything until last week. i remembered i had a $50 amazon gift card, and decided to get myself more boxer briefs and black long sleeve undershirts. i ended up with around $70 (puma performance boxer briefs are super comfy) in my cart. a few quick clicks and one confirmation email let me know my order went through. 

like i said that was last week. but as of today the package still hadn't gotten here. so i checked my order and it says that it arrived. i was pissed. i had issues with delivery in the past. but i live in a small apartment building and i didn't think anyone would take my boxes. 

and then i noticed the address it shipped to. apparently amazon auto filled in the last address i used:

thank you to everyone who shared their advice.  i contacted my hoi and the representative laughed at the fact that we were getting sued.  long story short she said not to worry and they would handle it.  i contacted a few lawyers in my family and they said the neighbors have no bounds to sue since trampolines are apparently illegal in my town.

turns out the neighbors do not own the house and that they rent it, the owner and landlord of that house was miffed since he is the one that will have to pay the fines for the trampoline.  turns out that the renters don't have renters insurance (which is why they asked for a cash payment from me). last i heard was that the landlord gave them a 30 day notice.  as for me?  i'm buying exterior cameras so this doesn't happen anymore.",2
"meta at any point, the advice you're reading could be coming from someone too young to sign up for social media without parental permissions.. this seems like a really weird meta post, but i just wanted to warn people that captain sparklez, a youtuber with a high child/teenager viewer base, spent almost a whole trails episode talking about this sub. it's bound to get us some new subscribers and bring up that young sub number.

it seems like it's good for people to remember that at any point the advice they are reading regarding their 20 year marriage might just be coming from someone who isn't even old enough to buy a drink, or shave. the thought of marriages and careers and lives being changed all because a 15 year old with no life experience told you to ""get out"" is actually incredibly scary to me.

this isn't to say no 15 year old is ever going to have good advice. honestly i knew a lot of teenagers who were more adult than any of the 30 years olds i know to this day. but it is still incredibly important to remember your advice and judgement might be coming from a high schooler. take everything you read here with about a pound of salt, a single grain won't do it.

i *am* the asshole, i already know this, but being the asshole doesn't always mean you're wrong. sorry, teenagers, but i kind of wish we could give you flair to make it easier to tell if advice is coming from an adult or a child. i wouldn't outright ignore a child's advice, but i would also be looking at their advice differently if i knew their lack of life experience. 🤷🏻‍♀️

just be careful everyone. and please remember this is a judgement sub, not an advice sub. this doesn't mean we can't give advice, but keep in mind ""sub dedicated to helping others"" is going to bring in a very different subscriber demographic than ""sub dedicated to calling other people assholes."" i just don't want to see lives ruined over this sub.",3

"for telling step-daughter she's the reason for divorce. yeah, i'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.

i came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). her mother is not happy. she hasn't been happy for a long time. her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids i've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.

she's made it no secret she hates me. i remember when she was 13 or 14, i paid for us to go to disney land as a family vacation (cliche, i know). she refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. i was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, i went along with it and stayed home.

stuff like that is the norm. she'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. she'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. it's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. but it's ruined the marriage, because i've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. anything i do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.

anyway, my wife and i separated over this. it's just too much for me to bare. but i'm not mad at my wife, i'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.

i decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. i didn't do this to spite her, because frankly i'm ready to move on with my life. i did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. i did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)

wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. say it's going to emotionally scar her. but quite frankly, i think she needed to be told.

"for saying i wont pay for my daughters education if she switches her major?. as i said in my title, last night i sat my daughter down and told her that if she switches her major i will cease her tuition payments.

my daughter is currently a freshman in college. she has just started her first semester and i'm the one paying the bill. i have been saving for over 10 years to do this and i am happy to do it, as long as i feel she is actually setting herself up for success. during high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. she took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. i supported her through all this because i thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.

this last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. my daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. i was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. she is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. now i know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but i was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. when i tried to get why she was switching all i got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in la. apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.

i tried to ask her the regular stuff ""what about your future"", ""how do you plan to get a job"", etc. and she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. this angered me. i'm the one paying for this i feel i have a right to know and not be blown off like that. i thought over it all day and so last night i sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. i am the one paying for her education and i won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. i told her if she doesn't want to do cs that's fine. but she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys and can get her a career. and if in the end she decides that she's an ""adult"" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. she can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.

this did not sit well with her. we fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. my ex called me up after and told me that i'm no better than a dictator right now and that i'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what i want.

&#x200b;

all i want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. here?

edit:

wow, did not expect this.

i have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. before i say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because i see the same question sent to me and i don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.

i do not have a problem with my daughter getting a la degree.

if my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, i would support her 100%. i don't care what my daughter does with her life. i just want her to do something with her life. i am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. the least i feel i can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. i get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. and many of you have told me that i should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a ""academic experience"" to teach her life lessons. for those two last points, i feel you are wrong.

this money that i have saved is not a ""gift"". this is what i have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. this is my investment in her. for people who claim that i should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, i respectfully disagree. giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing i could do for her right now. supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. and the fact that she seems to think that i am owed no explanation and that i should ""mind my own business because she's an adult"" is an insult to the investment i am making in her.

i am not arguing whether or not i am wrong. if you all feel i am an asshole for this, then i will accept that.

&#x200b;

so i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

after dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

"a good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. now his adult son is suing me (virginia).. so basically, i lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. he was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. we watched football together, drank together, and all that. i even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. the point, i guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. i think this point is important.




he recently passed, which sucks. then i learned he left me a little something. that little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since i had no idea he had that kind of money. that 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. so it's not like i'm getting the majority of his estate. but then his son, who i'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  i ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




i have three things going for me:




1. my friend was mentally acute. he had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. our town's not big, and i know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. hell, i even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. these people can be witnesses i think, though i don't know how civil suits work.


3. his adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. she came around from time to time, and knew her dad and i hung out and stuff. the first time i met her, her dad and i were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the south so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





basically, my point is he and i were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? also, what kind of lawyer should i hire? the lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but i don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.

over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but i'm not a casino and while i'm not destitute, i can't afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

so was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

edit: sorry guys i can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because i've been banned.

edit2: wow since i'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) i might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. i'm really that bad? i just thought i had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>if this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. forget our votes, listen to those. also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

if the moderators allow me to update, i will absolutely update and tell you how many friends i've lost. almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. and he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). in addition, i will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (az) and ask what trouble i might be in. i will also update on that when i can. people can't be this dramatic in real life...i'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and i'm still blown away by some of these comments. call me yta all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

edit4: well i was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  makes info hard but i'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why i can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? another friend says wow, that's cool i have $1.25 in my pocket, can i donate to your change jar? you'd say yes. now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey i just put .80 into your change jar, now i'm taking the whole thing."" you would say no. it's how i've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. i've given people quarters to play, i've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. i've taken in maybe $100 over five years. maybe. that's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


edit5: a good question:

>info did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? if no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

no he did not, the first time i ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  i don't mind if people play it, i even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

edit6: another good question

>also, need more info. you stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). did you let them keep it? if so, why are you making a double-standard here?


i would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. i do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why i'm asking here. but i do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits i wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

edit7: 

>info
we need to know where the money came from. did the money in the machine come from you putting it in or playing the machine

so this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). she said it gets full at $800. it was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, i always guessed $500. in five years it's now 7/8ths full. i play it from to time to time so i'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. i think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night i've ever seen that window empty. i know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so i may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if i'm way off base.

edit8: this is the best yta take so far and i can't let it get buried.

> i really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. i love the comments that say ""your edits make you yta! alone. where did the money come from btw?""  i truly can accept the yta votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. i wasn't profiting off this machine. i've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. i can't afford to give a random dude $700. i don't need it now, but i have savings account i don't need it now either but i might some day. and now i've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. so good thing i hung onto them right ? (i can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. i never cleaned it out because honestly i like the way it looked with the coins in the window. this thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. some nice ntas have suggested i have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. i actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (i got it five years ago) so i always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. as an example, over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. i had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. he was heartbroken when he didn't win (i might have given it to him since he was so cute) but i gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so i always, always give people money back if they ask. i never intended to profit off the machine. no one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>i bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who dm'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, i was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. my slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said i could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. in my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. so it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. there wasn't a jackpot at all. i don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. the guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  i still don't care if i'm yta till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. and fuck that guy.


edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that i will not be allowed to update this post. so the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. so had i been a real casino i would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. so yeah, i was totally in the right. fuck this sub. fuck the moderators. and fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. most of you however were cool.",3

"tifu by telling my gf to go right.. i finally get to post a fuck up. happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

my gf and i were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. awful game by the way. anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. the gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

the star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

as she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

which she immediately did.

i have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and i've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. nor have i ever been so afraid. she ended the game with 0 stars...

""i will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

the rest of the game was spent in dread. its now 3am and i'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

goodbye.

tl;dr mario party 7 is a terrible game.",4
"update gf and i (26m/f) got into a huge fight over a keyboard. previous post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)

short edit at bottom.
&nbsp; 

we met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. i was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so i suggested we meet at her place, so that i could bail if things went south...and they did.

&nbsp; 

even though i thought i made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my gfs coworkers figured out who the post was about (gf's age, working hr which i mentioned in a comment, same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my gf. the reason she wanted to meet early was because she was furious that i had made the post, 'airing our dirty laundry.' in a sense, i guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. my gf never used reddit so i figured i was safe.
there's a strong chance she'll read this one as well, lol.

&nbsp; 


anyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that i made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. i asked her to point out any part of it that wasn't true, or where i had lied. long story short, she couldn't point to a single thing. i definitely raised my voice when i told her that if she looked bad, it's only because of her actions. i told her i only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. the post was 100% accurate and she knew it. 

&nbsp; 

she began to tear up and asked me if i really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. i asked her if she understood that this wasn't about the keyboard. it was about the way she acted towards me when i was trying to do her a favor. she stayed silent and didn't answer. i asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was ok with her. i asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.

&nbsp; 

she got really defensive, asking ""are you calling me crazy?"" and ""do you think i'm unstable?"" i had no idea where she was going with this. i told her i wasn't calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that i was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it. 

&nbsp; 

we talked in circles for a bit, and i tried to pry it out of her. i still don't know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn't tell me. when i realized our conversation was going nowhere, i finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. she asked, ""what do you want from me?"" and i said, ""i want an apology.""

&nbsp; 

i'm getting tired of typing so i'll wrap this up quickly. she was absolutely unwilling to apologize. she thought that my ""betrayal"" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. we talked for about 5 more minutes before i told her that i don't even care anymore. i told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn't willing to help us get to the bottom if this. that we should just break up. i didn't waste any time making my way to the door.

&nbsp; 

as i was leaving, she asked if i wanted the keyboard back. she didn't ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. i could tell by her tone of voice. i told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.

&nbsp; 

i've been getting tons of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my fb). she obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like i really did leave her over the keyboard. i couldn't care less, as i'll never be seeing any of them again.

&nbsp; 

we only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, i don't feel terribly heartbroken. mostly just relief that it's over. but...also confusion. still have no idea why she acted out.

&nbsp; 

tl;dr: she wouldn't apologize or tell me what was wrong. after an exhausting conversation, i decided to end it.

&nbsp; 

**and to the people who had some unkind words towards me because i use a razer keyboard: pound sand, dorks. i like what i like.**

very short edit: she called earlier today and was very apologetic. my assumption is that she saw this post and read all the comments detailing how i was right for leaving her, among other things. i told her that she had her chance to apologize.",8

"a tinder experiment with my 28m girlfriend 27f of 3 years has gone horribly wrong.. hi all. 

&#x200b;

i've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and thereabouts, and all was going pretty well. i met her irl, but before that i was having no success with the tinder game. she, herself, never used it ever.

&#x200b;

2 weeks ago, she was telling me about some of her friends' horror stories on tinder, and i laughed with her and added ""tinder's way worse for guys, though"". she didn't believe me when i told her most guys get 0 matches, and i wouldn't either. so we decided to play (what seemed at the time) a fun game : set up tinder profiles of each other and see what happened. and the obvious happened: after one week, i had pretty much no matches except bots. on the other hand, she was bombarded with matches and messages, quite a few of them from pretty attractive guys (or at least, what i judge to be attractive guys, a lot of them probably more than me). she admitted i was right and that it was an ""eye opener"". we agreed to shut down our profiles.

  
the problem is, ever since, she's grown slightly more distant and cold, and it's now beginning to be noticeable. basically less happy to see me, much less in the mood for sex, not as physical or cuddly as before, and more importantly way more monosyllabic in our conversations. etc. i sat her down yesterday to talk about it, and she was evasive. when i asked if the tinder experiment had anything to do with it, she looked away and just vaguely said ""i don't know, maybe"". 

&#x200b;

i feel like i've played myself here. is this doomed or is there any way i can save it?

update 2: aa called me, apologized for the fa ""escalating out of control"". they will open an internal investigation. i conveyed that i don't want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 but that it's up to aa to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. i don't want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

she assured me that i won't get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me.

forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. it's just that i talked back (""no i don't but okay"") and i regret that so much.

update 1: thank you so much for your quick advice on a sunday morning! i memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

as we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

""the police will contact you when you get home. you will be banned from future flights."" 

""ok."" 

""oh i hope so."" as she walked away. 

i burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. she won. 

there was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my miranda rights. i made it home in one piece. still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future aa flights. i've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. my thanksgiving and holiday flights are both on aa. 

my seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. they gave me their business card in case i need a witness. 

thank you again for your helpful comments. i am not in jail (yet) at least!

original post: 

i can't believe this is happening to me. i'm flying from chicago to boston now and police are waiting for me when i land, so i don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

edit: i've looked all over the internet and can't find any faa rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

here's what happened:

..

i was on an american airlines flight from chicago to boston on november 3rd, 2019. because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, i use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. this sling is often advertised on facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. i am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""you have to put your feet on the ground!"" i cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""no i don't but okay."" as i put my feet down. emphasizing again. **i complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** although i had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights i've taken with my foot sling, i complied. i put my feet down immediately. 

even if it's technically not allowed by some rule i'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

she immediately escalated: 
""would you like to go back to the gate? we're gonna go back to the gate!"" and immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

but right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

she came back to my seat and barked: 
""police will be waiting for you when we land in boston.""

my seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. i had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no i don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

her statement caused me to panic inside. i'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

so i took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight.

**original** 

i \42m\ am a single father to my daughter \14f\. my wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. she's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. she doesn't see too much of me because i work 9-7, but i'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

around tuesday, i noticed there was something off about her. she was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch tv together. i figured it was just moody teenage hormones. except it doesn't stop. friday i finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. she looked at me and just burst into tears. she cried more, so i held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""i'm pregnant.""

i was shocked. utterly and completely shocked. i kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. i took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. i didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, i'd wait until she calmed down a little. saturday she came down for breakfast and i sat her down and asked her her plans. she said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. i then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. i calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? i go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. she suggested she start online school, which i refused, saying i don't want her to ruin her life.

the thing is, i don't even want to consider adoption. i can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. i don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if i lose her?i told her this, and she asked me if i had no love for my grandchild. but i don't. i don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, i care about her. the girl i raised. i told her today that she had to abort her child. she cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. there's no way i'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. and for school, i don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

at this point, i see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, i'm kicking her out. it hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, i'm afraid her life will truly be over. i won't actually, but i'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. i'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do i get out of this?

where do i go from here?

tl;dr: my daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**update**

so today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. it's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. they said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

after the doctor's i took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. i told her i had to know, she had to tell me. she refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. we went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so i took it and looked through her messages. according to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. she hadn't told him yet.   
i wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him i was \daughter's name\ dad, and i needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. i expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so i called his mom and i told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. she asked if i was sure, and i said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. i said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. she said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. i asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. she asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. she hung up before i could say anything else. 

now i don't know where i stand. i can't afford a lawyer, and i don't think i can make him get involved either way. i don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. is there a way they could get out of paying it? i don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

my daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but i'm going to stop peppering her with it now. my sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and i hope a female influence will work better on her than i am. she's sending a little bit of money, and i think i may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and i can do.

"i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i don't know what to say to her.. hey everyone. i don't know what to do in this situation because i never expected i'd face something like this. i'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but i'm coming up seriously short here.

i met my wife on tinder at the end of 2015. we talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. by the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. we were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. more than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

i know, heavy topics for a first date. we were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

at the very least i held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. she immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

we dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. after getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

four nights ago was the first time i ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. my wife was out with a friend, and i was doing some house cleaning. i was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so i took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. at the bottom i saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case b were visible. i immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

i had known that my wife was on her period because when i tried to initiate sex, she told me so. i found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and i made comment about the timing being odd. she told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. i figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

i haven't told her that i found the box. when she got home that night everything was so normal. i tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

the more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. what if she was assaulted? what if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? what if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? or, what if she just cheated? i only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of plan b and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

i don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. we have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. i've done nothing to displease her, at least that i know of. maybe i'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than i'm giving it credit for. but i feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because i don't know how.

**tl;dr** i found a torn up plan b box in my trash. the only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. how do i bring this up?",8

"my 45m wife 42f revealed she was unfaithful and i'm divorcing her. our children 15f & 17m hate me for it.. edit: guys, i appreciate the advice. but i'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. i've made my decision, and it's not something i'm willing to forgive. i'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

my wife and i have been together for 18 years. we had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. we've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

about two weeks ago i brought up an advice column in the paper i had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and i could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so i asked her what was bothering her. she confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. this was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. she says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. we talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. i realized i knew i'd never be able to let this go, nor would i be able to forgive her. she's distraught.

we sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. obviously this was extremely tough. they acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. my wife and i agreed to tell them it was mutual, but i guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. this had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. my wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. i don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so i'm being trying to explain as tactfully as i can, but they're gone as far as saying that when i get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that i still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. my wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since i've told her of my plan to leave.

i love my kids, but i don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. i don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that i'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. i just know that i cannot get past this, and for my own happiness i need to leave. any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

"update: i am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. i got found out.. i post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

since that time i got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until i landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

recently i found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what i used to do, and pays more. basically tired of doing nothing even though im getting paid for it.  

the day after i mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office i got a phone call exactly at 8 am. the head of hr for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. i asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. she stated that there were no issues like that. they just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

i told her that they should have that information as head of hr and promptly disconnected stating i had to return back to work. she called back at 12:05 exactly. 

i have been ducking her calls ever since. her voicemails state that i am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. my emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. each time i am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. she calls at least once per day. 

i am thinking i just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

how incredibly bad is that plan? before anyone says it. i know... i know ok i should have quit a long time ago. i did not.

"(az) our neighbors dog was poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. i say absolutely not. how should we proceed?. i guess some background is in order here. earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. we were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. the next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. they did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. the next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. this all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

so they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. we tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

so we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. we have yet to contact the lawyer. 

we had made the initial report to animal control last thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" i was really taken aback and i think i asked ""i think so, do you need some?"" 

he then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. i literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. i explained that i actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and i really have no way of knowing which dog is which). he said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" i got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


the officer then asked if he could take everything. i said i wasn't comfortable with that but i would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. i did exactly this. i was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. again i was taken completely aback and said that i'm not sure what he'd be looking for. he told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. it took me as second but i asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. i asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if i remember) ""not yet."" 
i asked him if i could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. i said i would really rather not but i would get back in touch with him. he gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

i just got home and told my wife. my wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. we have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but i feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

she thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. i say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. i'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. wife thinks we should let them, i say absolutely not.

"update neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. now she's trying to sue me. we're the ones with 29k in medical bills. nc usa. here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=jsce6bw3&sh=7f56780f


my sister and i spent the weekend after i posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
the guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
he is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

the neighbors mean dog has been put down.  she was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

we've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

she was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
one from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  i'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

one for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

her lawsuit against me has a court date of march 5th.  after she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   she then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

she finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in nc where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

now for some extra facts. 

my left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on february 27th. 

our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  the vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  she still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

the destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

the day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  she broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  she straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  she also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

we called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. they asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

the video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  it shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. it also shows her audibly laughing during it. she only started trying to help when i started smashing her dog into the ground. 

we also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the hoa. 

he said it's pointless to go after the hoa and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  our lawyer did tell us that the hoa has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

there was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

i honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

either way, my sister and i both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of march. 

thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. you guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

i'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  please feel free to ask any questions and i'll answer whatever i can.

"""my body my choice"" isn't a good argument against pro-life people. gonna start this off by immediately saying i am pro choice, and not going to get into debates about that here. i just want to say people who keep repeating the lines ""it is my body"" and ""it is my choice"" aren't going to sway any pro-life people to come to your side.

pro-life people believe that a fetus is alive, and aborting it is akin to murder, they don't see a difference between aborting a 2 month old fetus and killing a just born baby. so repeating the same lines at them over and over again with the assumption they agree a fetus isn't its own being with its own rights is just going to piss them off.

a few days ago my25m girlfriend29 suggested that we should have a threesome with another girl.

knowing her, i disagreed at first. she kept on insisting and i gave into the idea. i cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
a few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. then when i finally reached her she was crying. she seemed broken. she told me that i didn't deny her strong enough. she told me that had i ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. she was mad and we broke up because i didn't deny her strongly.
basically, i feel as if she set up a trap and is now giving me a hard time for it..
i feel that i am being manipulated. dear reddit, please help me out. thanks.

update (2 weeks after the post): first off, thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. the comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. thanks a lot.

we had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. so, i decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. no clue about her intentions though, but i am at a much better place. thank you reddit!",8
"update to my (22f) twin (22f) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23m) of 8 months.. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dckm1r/my_22f_twin_22f_has_slept_or_tried_to_sleep_with/

so i've made a lot of changes in my family life since i posted this a couple weeks ago. i first told everything to my boyfriend. he was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. he also respected that i didn't want her to meet him. 

i decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. she immediately noticed like within ten minutes after i'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so i didn't beat around the bush, i said yes because i didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. she tried to guilt trip me about how i hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like i knew they would). she exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but i hadn't even gotten a chance to say i was worried she'd do this. she said it first so what does that say?

i told her i flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. she called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. i can't reason with her. she just never sees the problem with anything she's done. the way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

i blocked her number, i still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. but we live hours apart, so i figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

then, as for them, i also got a call from my mom soon after i blocked my sister who wanted to know what i was doing because she was upset. she'd already heard my sister's side which was just that i'd blocked her out of nowhere. so i tried to tell her my side. i did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like i said in the first post i'm not going to fall to petty revenge. i just want her to stop interfering in my life. so all i said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys i've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. my mom then wanted to know what i meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). she also got my dad on the call at this point. i told them the details didn't matter. she kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if i had been having premarital sex. it was really frustrating. 

i told them the point i'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. they began saying i should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. well i'm not exactly fighting. i'm simply not going to be in contact with her. to them it's the same thing. 

then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. i said i wasn't going to do that, that i'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. they said they'd come to me then. that brought up how they show up for random visits even when i've said i don't like it. i told them i didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again i wouldn't let them in or talk with them. so they flipped out, that was fun, i got to hear all how i'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

i ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. and blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

i don't know wtf i'm going to do about them. they did threaten to stop paying for my college if i cut them out of my life. i unblocked them to say i want to be in touch with them and do love them but i can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. i said if they stop doing that then i'm happy to have a relationship with them. they had a million reasons why i'm in the wrong. i couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. so i don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

my boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. he thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. he's really helped keep me as sane as i can be. 

overall i just feel really shitty. i wish any of them would ever listen to what i say. but if they won't then what can i do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. it just sucks it has to be so...final, i guess. i wouldn't mind a middle ground like planning a visit with them once in a while, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than i do. 

tl;dr: i'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",8

so what happened. in the proccess of rearranging my kitchen i decided to consolidate a few boxes of the same product (lipton tea) i had several boxes and was going to put them all into one. simple enough i thought. 

now with my new girl friend standing to my right i open the first box and holly mother of fucking pearl it cant be, but it is the ring box. this is where my thinking was holly shit i just found that ring, no way... hey babe check this out just found that ring i lost. not really thinking a lot about it i open the box and turn to her. 

seemed pretty simple i found a lost ring, hey look what i found.

and thats when she made a really awkward face started shaking and runs out of the room basicly saying no fucking way oh my god no fucking way. at this point im like wtf was that about. when i walk around the corner to check whats wrong shes almost crying saying really too soon, not yet at least.

"by sending a picture of the engagement ring to my girlfriend. tl;dr: accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.

&nbsp;

  so this was actually a few months ago. i (24m) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24f). i was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. 

&nbsp;

  so i put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. welp, it was immediately after clicking send that i noticed the texts in the thread didn't look right. i looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: it was my gf. ""shit"" i said over the phone. my friend asked what was wrong, and i told him i'd have to call him back. tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.

&nbsp;

  as a last ditch effort, i called her, as the message did not yet say ""delivered"". she answered the phone and i immediately said ""do you see the message i just sent?"" ""yeah...it says attachment, why?"" immediately i blurted ""dont open it! just delete the thread. please."" 

&nbsp;

  she sounded concerned, and asked ""is this something i should be worried about? you're kinda scaring me lol"". ""no, no,"" i said, ""i just have a little surprise for you i was trying to show someone and don't want to ruin the surprise."" she relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. ""ok, i deleted it. didn't look at it."" i know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but i can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. the 1 or 2 times i ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. it's just not in her to lie, and she's honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).

&nbsp;

  so i had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now i had her highly suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. so i immediately went and found a cute little necklace on etsy i knew she'd like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. later that week she got it and texted me, saying i was very sweet and she loved my surprise. phew. a few weeks later i actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected i was going to propose. despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her ""girls' day"" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.

&nbsp;

  when i told her about what that text really was and how i covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. she was impressed with how i improvised and threw her off track lol. we're getting married next october :)

"update: i just recieved a demand letter from enterprise rent-a-car stating that if i do not return their rental car, i will be charged with embezzlement and grand theft auto. i never rented a car from them. (san jose, california). thank you to everyone for the advice. i'm also a she by the way (many of you thought i was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

after my initial post, i saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because enterprise is the one at fault and i shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. so i did exactly this, and she told me that id i want her to give me more info, i would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that i am not the person who rented the car.  if not, she would report me for embezzlement and grand theft to the sacramento police. upon hearing this, i decided to file a report immediately online with the san jose police department. i know many of you said i shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, i did not want to take any chances where i could end up with a warrant on my head.  i thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  after filing it, i emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  when i spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that i was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

on may 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. she showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had my information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with cash. (i thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) the manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the sacramento police later that afternoon. the following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as fraud, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  at this point, i was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. i then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to sacramento see who the hell this woman is. however, turns out i didn't have to because 2 hours later...  
  
  
  
the san jose police did show up knocking on my front door. ( 2 policemen and 2 chp officers) before opening it, the first thing i did was grab the copy of the police report i printed because i seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). when i open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if name of woman i do not know lives at my home? i tell them no, and that i have no idea who that is,  then they ask if i am alymg and i tell them that i am. they then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of fremont that morning. the accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. they then show the license to me and it's an exact replica of my drivers license, and i ask them how this is possible if i have my license in my wallet? they then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (the black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) i then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when i hand them my report. i explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from enterprise.  so basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. i told the officers that i have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. i then asked them who is the name of the woman i do not know and they told me that she is the who stole the car. however, i'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we do not look a-like at all. idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. but after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

i do have her name now though, and after doing a google search i found her facebook and other social media accounts. i'm very tempted to message her but i've decided to leave this to the police because i have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she does know where i live) however, i do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

thanks to everyone's terrific advice, i got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to rainn) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and i were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

one of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching i am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting i was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (i'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

the ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward.

"by going down a reddit rabbit hole.. this didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and i bought a new car. i was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

i came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse reddit while i'm taking care of my business. most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. i can't remember what sub i was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. before i knew it i was reading about ""the donkey show."" yes that one. some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. i wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so i just kept reading.

someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how the donkey show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. midget porn. i thought, ""what the hell, i've never seen this sort of thing before."" so i clicked.

as weird as it sounds, i clicked out of curiosity......i swear. what i saw was exactly what i expected to see. this specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. after a minute or so, i had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub i was in.

i finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. i get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

she was taking a while, so i grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. my wife comes out and gets in the car. immediately she says, ""what the hell is this?"" i put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. on the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". i had never had a car with this feature before, so i was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. i knew i was screwed. it felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so i could change what was displayed on the screen.

after about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks i have a thing for little people. before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. all i could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. i'm pretty sure i'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. yay me...

she said to me one day, ""i know you won't leave me for another woman, but i'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

i doubt she will ever let this one go...

"for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister?. i found out i was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. when i told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if i had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. i was already living independently, both my boyfriend and i worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. in our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so i thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

during my pregnancy i asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when i started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when i wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when i was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. they refused, telling me that i was expecting to be catered to. they also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that i was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that i was making dumb decisions"". when i spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that i was trying to get gifts from them. i had severe post-partum depression and thought i was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. my relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. they told me they were afraid i was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

which brings us to today, 3 years later. my sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than i did when i was treated ""as an independent adult"". our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff i have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. i answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. i've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

i am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. i've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that i need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

i'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and i send all the hugs in the world to you! the feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




edit 30 juli: 

i just wanted to say that i've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" i believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. my mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that i wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

for anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. being away from family is hard and i missed mine alot. being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",8
"i was filmed against my consent at a party. (update). last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

history: myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. in a private villa where expected things to be private. a pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. i asked if we have legal options against the person.

we went to the police. myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. they didn't. they said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

it sucked. i didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone i know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

but this didn't end there. this perv didn't stop. he tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. they got him and handed him over to the police. so he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. they took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

he's now locked up. our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

it took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him.

"in 4 days ago i accidentally almost got into the wrong car, causing the elderly woman inside the car to try to flee and she fell. today i was told i'd be sued if i didn't pay ambulance & er bills.. 
four days ago (monday 11/4) i was parked in a very full parking lot and returned to my car in a distracted state. i didn't realize that i was parked next to a car that was identical to mine. i opened the unlocked driver's side door and put my leg in, but immediately withdrew my leg because i heard someone inhale sharply and then heard the passenger side door open. obviously this wasn't my car so i began apologizing and, as i was shutting the door, i could see an elderly woman struggling to get out of the car.

i was still apologizing when she fell out of the car. i went around quickly and asked if she was alright, did she need me to call an ambulance, did she need me to go find whoever she was waiting for, etc. she told me i didn't need to call an ambulance, but asked if i would stay with her until her daughter came back. she didn't know which store her daughter was in and didn't have her number memorized. i helped her back into the passenger seat. 

she had an abrasion on her right palm, which i offered to disinfect since i keep a first aid kit in my car. she accepted and said she wasn't hurt anywhere else, just shaken up. she asked me for water and i gave her a bottle from my car. she told me she was diabetic and that her blood sugar was low and she didn't have her insulin with her, so i offered her a banana. we spent about 5 or so minutes together before her daughter came running up.

we explained to her what happened and the daughter was pissed at me, rightfully so since i did scare her mother and she fell. i offered again to call an ambulance to make sure she was alright and they both refused. i suggested they take her to her doctor as soon as possible to make sure she didn't injure anything from the fall. i apologized again and went home. 

this morning the daughter and her husband showed up on my front porch. i think they were trying to intimidate me since the husband stood there the entire time with his arms crossed and with what i assume was supposed to be a scary look on his face. 
the elderly woman and i only exchanged first names so i don't know how they found out who i am or where i lived. i asked and they said they ""had their ways."" the daughter told me she ended up calling an ambulance because her mother began to have a panic attack before they left the parking lot. i asked if she was okay and she told me that wasn't any of my business. she said that they were going to sue me if i didn't pay the er bill and the ambulance bill. they said they wanted $3,500. i asked if her mother had insurance and was again told it wasn't my business. i asked to see the bills because i obviously have my doubts and they said they didn't have them with them. i said ""so you expect me to just hand you $3,500?"" and that pissed them both off. i told them to get off of my property and that i'd call the police if they refused or came back. i told them to have their lawyer contact me. they both called me a bitch and left. 

i've included every detail i can think of, so my question is could they really sue me? i understand you can basically sue anyone for anything, but am i legally responsible to pay these medical bills if they do in fact exist? 

thanks in advance. i'm on mobile, so i apologize for any formatting errors. 

edit: thank you to those who responded. i'm 31, but often get mistaken for someone much younger. the daughter and her husband are, or look to be, in their mid to late forties. i suspect they may just have seen what they think to be a young and naive woman that may be dumb/scared enough to pay them.

i do have a home security system. i can also defend myself should my home security system fail. thank you to those voicing concern for my safety.

i don't know much about diabetes. the woman told me she was lightheaded, that she had diabetes, and that her blood sugar was low. she asked if i had any food and i gave her the banana in my purse. she specifically mentioned not having her insulin with her.",2

"girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time"". so before your read, i need to say i have nothing against cuddling to sleep. i actually love it.

the problem i have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

and honestly i wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

but no, she doesn't want it like that. she absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

if i just start to get sleepy (wich i am because i want to sleep), she will get upset.

she absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because i have to keep my eyes open too.

she also needs sweet talk, wich i like but not when it's forced like that. she literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""i love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what i think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... and honestly i have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. and we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like i never say it.

but the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. and that can take some time. sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

i know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with so, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when i tell her i'm tired and i want to sleep.

if i say i'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""no ! don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so i have no say in it.

seriously, i think she's just being too clingy and childish. is it unreasonable to just say ""good night i love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? i don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if i don't do enough.

i feel like i have no control over when i can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for several hours.

honestly i wish i could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but i can't. it's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when i'm tired.

could i have some insight ? what do you think ? am i being unreasonable ?

thanks for reading.

**edit: thank you very much to all of you guys, your comments and insights have been really helpful, i will continue to read your replies and answer some of your question. i feel a lot better about the whole thing, and now i'm confident about moving forward and putting a stop to all this. i will talk to her and make her understand that she needs therapy if she wants to make it work.**

"i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. throwaway, because reasons.

tl;dr: found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. asked girlfriend about it. she started yelling at me and crying and left.

i don't even know where to start with this. i'm dumbfounded. she just stormed out the house and i'm sitting on the bed asking myself a lot of questions.

i live a pretty normal life, and i thought so did my girlfriend. we've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. we started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. she would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. i'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. i always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, i wouldn't stop her.

this is where it takes a turn for the weird. i keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. i also go to the gym frequently, so i always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. i never kept count, but i know by just a visual glance i several pairs. this morning when i went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, i noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. i went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so i checked the washing machine and dryer. both were empty. i couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. so, i did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. after all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. she went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. when i went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. i told her i wasn't mad, i was just looking for my socks. she kinda mumbled ""i'll don't know."" i still wasn't mad, of course, but i was super confused. socks just don't disappear. so i asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""i'll buy you new ones!""

the first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. i thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so i joked with her about ruining my socks. wrong. thing. to. say. she started immediately crying. like, full on sobbing. at this point i don't care about the socks anymore, i want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. i sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. she just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. i tried assuring her again it was okay. even went so far as to say i would buy new socks and she didn't have to. i sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. i told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

on my way out i grabbed the garbage to take outside. when i got outside i lifted the lid off the garbage can and i noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. i could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. since i was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, i wanted to see for myself. i opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. there, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. as soon as the smell hit me i knew it was poop.

1. we don't own any pets.
2. we don't have any kids.
3. whose poop was on my socks?

work could wait. i couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. i grabbed the bag and walked back inside. as soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. she said i shouldn't be going through the garbage and that i was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. i asked her to calm down and that i just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. i wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. that's when it clicked. i don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. i asked her ""is this your poop?"" she started sobbing again and ran out of the house. i didn't go after her this time.

so, now i am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. the only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. i sent her text asking her to come back. she hasn't responded yet. i don't even know what i'm going to say when (if) she gets back.

update:

i had to leave for work and am now at work. yes, i threw away the bag of poopy socks. she texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. she said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to not bring it up in person. i'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as i can. her responses are super short, but i'm getting the idea.

i flat out asked her if it was a fetish. it is not a fetish. she confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. i found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. i had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? she thought i would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. she admitted she has done this for a long time. her reasoning, as best as i can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in any way. she uses socks because it covers her entire hand. after she's done with them, she throws them away. she used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

so, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. it could be worse, i guess. i hope we can laugh about this later. i'm trying to find the humor in it now, but i'm still weirded out.

"for thinking a divorce announcement due to an affair was an april fools joke?. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


am i the asshole?

"by being accidentally racist. so this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



recently ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so i thought i'd go along. 

so anyway here i am about to play my first game of chess ever. i sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (i should now mention my opponent was african american). the chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

i think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

so i grab a pawn and slide it forward, then i look up expecting my opponent to make his move. instead i'm met with a look of confusion and horror, i begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

i then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" i murmur. 
the teacher nods. 

now everyone thinks i'm a massive racist.

thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. i was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

a little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

the dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. my kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he ""loves his new house"". he asks for daddy nightly saying ""i just want daddy be happy. i just want daddy not be mad any more"" and it breaks my heart but i just tell him i love him and hold him when he is hurting. i realized even being here i am happier than i ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. i don't feel like i'm constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

the shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. my 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and i've seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

they have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. the attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. they are also filing a long term protective order. 

we have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

i will be starting work again next week. my hr manager contacted the store up where i am now to have me transferred because of the situation. i am so thankful the company i work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though i've had to take the last few weeks off while i get things in order. 

the shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on wednesday for both children while i start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. the daycare facility is wonderful and i'm so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while i start work again! 

since i am able to start work again too i was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

i was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. i was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

a detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while i handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. the detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. so, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a class c family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when i was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a class a and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

he has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying i kidnapped the children and also filed a false cps report. i handed over all evidence to cps as well and they immediately closed it saying they ""can tell he is not being honest"" as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. he did text me a few days ago saying we didn't need to get attorneys though and let's just go file a custody agreement, but i didn't respond. if i even let him see the children until things get worked out i risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

his mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to florida so i would never see them again.... 

so, things are moving along. it has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but i've never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. i feel like things are pulling together even faster than i imagined. it's stressful... by the end of the day sometimes i just want to cry still, but it's not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

i hope one day i can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources are available. it's not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what i ever could have imagined and hoped for and i will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing.

"dear humans: vanilla is not ""plain"", ""boring"", or ""flavorless"". it *is* a flavor, and a rich one at that. (blame ice cream's history). when you are served ice cream, you are served vanilla as the ""default"" ice cream. and it is white, a word often synonymous with ""blank"" or ""empty"". this made kids everywhere assume that vanilla is just the ordinary and boring. but it's not.

it really doesn't help that in the u.s., major food companies are penny-pinching jerks who make cheaper-tasting flavor (and who also ruin people's understanding of ""american cheese"", a cheese which-- when you make it right-- is a good contender with any other flavorful cheeses you see on the shelf every day.) vanilla was once described in europe as the ""essence and epitome of flavor"". that's why it became so common. and over time, vanilla was widely substituted with cheaper things. ""natural vanilla flavor"" isn't vanilla. it's a natural flavor that tastes kinda like it (and often comes from something you don't want to hear about, not that i think there's anything wrong with substitute flavors in general). real vanilla is fantastic.

stop misrepresenting vanilla. it's a great flavor. (although i know that software terms are already dooming ""vanilla"" to continue being thought of as ""boring"", and there's nothing i can do to fix that. as if ""vanilla minecraft"" is even boring... sigh.)",6

"instead of using the phrase ""i assumed..."" use the phrase ""my understanding was..."". the phrase ""i assumed..."" has a very negative connotation, and people will view it as you jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.




on the other hand, if you use the phrase ""my understanding was..."", it has a way more positive connotation. plus people will just view it as you made a slight mistake in understanding, and will be far kinder to you.



this is best applied in a workplace/professional environment. if you tell your boss that you ""assumed"" something typically results in a reprimand; saying ""my understanding was..."" will instead just be viewed as a miscommunication.",9

"if i called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?. my son was born when i was only 15 years old, and i've been a single dad since i was 18. it was hard living for a long time money-wise but i always tried to do best by my son. today i own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. he came out to me when he was 14 years old and i've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

i've been with my fiance now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. my son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and i've gotten to know him really well. however my fiance told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. that if they found out, they would have a complete fit. this really bothered me because i refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. what is going to happen in the future? when my son gets married himself? will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? he's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. when i told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that i was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. i told her that this was unacceptable and that i was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. it's my wedding too and i was his boyfriend there. 

after that i got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. however, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. i do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. i love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. i told my brother and he said that i was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. i still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. would i be the asshole if i did this? am i being unreasonable here?",3

"update my 30m wife 29f more or less abandoned me and the kids, with nothing more then a note. i don't know what to do.. here is my original post:  here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0c1kd/my_30m_wife_29f_more_or_less_abandoned_me_and_the/)

i wanted to thank everyone for your help. this isn't a super happy post, but i felt the need to update. 

a few days after i posted that, i got a call from her parents it turns out she took her own life, she left a written message for me and the kids in english that was basically consisted of her apologizing, and going in great lengths about how she didn't understand who she was anymore. but she thanked me and told me she loved me.

the funeral was held in korea last week, i went with the kids. her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. they also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

however this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. even then there is a big language barrier between us. my ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them. 

i still have a huge amount of stuff to mentally unpack, and figure out however i am not panicking for money right now. i don't really know how to feel about this at all.

"it should be illegal for a pregnant woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigs while pregnant, and grounds for removal by child services.. some may claim this isn't unpopular, but i think it is. bodily autonomy, no one owning a pregnant woman's body (not even the fetus growing inside of it), the fact that you can't even file a cps report for a follow up *after* the birth of a child to a woman who drank like a fish her whole pregnancy, or a woman who delivered prematurely due to their nicotine addiction. 

if you are pregnant and intend on carrying and birthing that child, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to make sure that baby is born as healthy as possible. it should be illegal for any woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes while she's growing a developing fetus. 

it should be punishable as felony child abuse or neglect if the child is born with any deformities or developmental issues related to the substance abuse (this is provable with medical expertise), and charged as a misdemeanor if not. at the very least, cps should be allowed to intervene before the child is born, and remove the child upon birth. 

edit: for those who keep bring it up, no, weening after a few weeks when you know you're pregnant would not be ground for removal in this scenario. this applies to those who have no intent of quitting, and exhibit no attempt at quitting either behaviors. common sense would still be applied by cps.

"super awesome update sat down on my friend's macbook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.. i never thought this would turn out the way it did and i really felt like i learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

i went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and i sincerely thank each and every one of you.

i did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so i wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, i'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. she sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

i got served a few days later and went to court. i told the judge i gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current macbook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (i printed out the email i sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. i also told him that when i offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no i want the money in cash. when i told her i'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. i tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

she gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case i guess. after listening to both of us he ruled that i pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. so i'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

if it weren't for you guys i would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and i honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

i feel good for following all the advice here.

"for spiking my leftovers with ghost pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson. so my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. after several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. a few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. i wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing i'd eat it the next day. 

since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

i'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. after he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and i get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. i hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",3

"by playing a joke on a colleague who took it seriously. i ended up losing a vacation day and got a disciplinary action in my file.. i worked for a workman's compensation provider some time ago and there was a guy in my department - todd - who was mildly annoying.  nice enough guy, but just a bit juvenile.  he enjoyed pranks and was always trying to get a rise out of everyone in the office.  little things like taping our computer mouse or asking ransom for the return of our coffee cup. it got to be enough, so i decided he needed some payback.

he paid out a claim that was huge and he was nervous about it. i don't know why, but it just seemed like an opportunity to me, and so i waited. about a week later, in a team meeting (everyone was in on it but todd), i said that there were some payouts that were kicked upstairs for review and that it was a potentially serious situation.

a couple of days after that, i stopped and poked my head into his office and asked, ""did you payout x-amount on the smith file?"" he said he had and asked me why. i just walked away.

the following monday, i had my plan laid out fairly well.  after sharing the detail with my brother-in-law, he suggested that i borrow his black surplus impala cop-car and park it at the entrance. then, early that morning, i went about putting crime scene tape across the door to todd's his office.

i had the receptionist in on it too. when todd came in that morning, she would look at him, then fumble for the phone, turn her back and mumble into the receiver.

todd made it to the top of the steps when i rushed up to him and said, ""dude - go, just go!""

""what the hell are you talking about?"" he asked.

""just turn around and leave - drive, drive anywhere, just go!""

he shrugged me off, but i could tell that he was a little rattled. he turned the corner to see his office door blocked with crime scene tape and for a moment, he froze in his tracks. he walked past his office and around the corner, out of sight. he ended up slipping out through the stairwell.

he was gone for nine hours. i had to call his wife to get a message to him that it was a joke.

his absence meant that management got involved. i had to confess to being the perpetrator of the prank. i got a stern talking-to (my boss was trying really hard not to laugh) and i lost a vacation day as a result, but it was worth it.

todd doesn't tape my mouse anymore.


tl;dr  i played a practical joke on a colleague and he took it seriously


*edit:  i posted this thinking it might be amusing to a few of you and i wasn't expecting much of a response from it.  i have to say, i've enjoyed the pissy posts the most, the ones saying i went too far.  yes i did, which is why this was a fu.  for any of you worried about todd, he's fine.  this actually happened in 1993 and i posted it because todd and i were remembering it recently (and laughing) and so i had it on my mind.  yes, i still work with him (a different company now) and we've been friends for almost 25 years.*",4
"and my son ended up thinking santa clause was stealing penises.. so my wife comes home after picking our two youngest kids up from school. she opens the door and goes, ""did you say something about santa clause stealing penises?""

i reply, ""i didn't say any shit like that. i would never ruin christmas.""

here's how we got there:

i have two daughters and a son. my son was 3 or 4 at the time. he refused to wear clothes and ran around naked or in his underwear. my daughters weren't having any of it and were like, ""this is your department, old man. do something.""

i tried to reason with my son and that just didn't work. i was thinking that i needed something to use that he was afraid to lose. he's a tiny kid. he'll play with a cardboard box and be happy. 

that's when he came running past me with both hands on his junk. that's it. he loves his dick. i love my dick. me and my penis are tight. 

so my son and youngest daughter are eating lunch. i look across the table and go, ""hey big guy, you know how sometimes you can't go to sleep cause you think there's something in your closet?""

hesitantly, ""... yes.""

""i didn't want to scare you but you're old enough to know now.""

his eyes got wide and my daughter had a puzzled look on her face. she's 4 years older. 

i go, ""there's a goblin that lives in your closet. and if you don't do what you're supposed to, like wear underwear and clothes, he creeps out at night while you're asleep and steals your penis.""

he incredulously responds, ""nah ah.""

i reassure, ""oh yeah. what do you think happened to your mom and sisters?""

at this point my youngest daughter loses her mind laughing. she's holding her sides and almost falls out of her seat. 

my son was dead silent. i could almost hear him thinking, ""damn... they don't have dicks.""

so where does santa clause come in?

after i told my wife i would never ruin christmas, she tells me she heard our son say to our daughter, ""you must have done something really bad for santa clause to steal you penis.""

my guy confused goblins with santa somehow and thought santa clause was roaming around with a big red sack full of stolen dicks. 

fear not. i straightened him out. i googled pics of santa and pics of goblins from the movie labyrinth. 

tldr: tried to scare my son into wearing under wear and he ended up thinking santa clause was stealing dicks.

"pa landlord from 6 years ago is telling me he forgot to cash my rental checks. am i obligated to send him new ones?. my landlord of six years ago sent me a letter with photocopies of old checks i had sent him. according to him, he forgot to cash said checks and is requesting new ones. there are several checks and the total amount is not insignificant.

i'm in a fairly tight spot myself at the moment handling a mortgage, house repairs, etc. i don't see how i could pay back the requested amount without causing undue stress on myself.

what movie fucked you up mentally?. ,1
"(nsfw) by forgetting that my boyfriend creampied me last night and going to my gynecologist's appointment.. before everyone freaks out - yes, i am on birth control. also, apologies on format because of mobile blah blah.

this happened 30 minutes ago. i'm currently sitting in my car outside my gynecologist's office typing this.

my boyfriend and i both lead pretty busy lives. he works full time and often works overnight shifts. on the other hand, i'm a full time student that works 30-35 hours a week. on top of that, i had to put down my beloved fur child last saturday, so as expected, he hasn't really been putting his wand in my chamber of secrets..if you catch my drift.

after an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in conan o'brien's words, ""take grandma to applebee's."" it's been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. as in, i felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. when i was cleaning myself up after, i noticed just how much was coming out of me and when i told him he laughs it off and says,"" haha, yeah, that was a lot.""

anyways, this morning i check my calendar and of course i have a gyno appointment. i'm the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, i completely forget about last nights sexscapade. 

fast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. i guess my gyno was training a physician's assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. 

for the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner sasha grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists' viewing pleasure. they then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. ya know, nothing's better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified vag while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.

anyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. my experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions (keep in mind that he was not behind her but was to my left). midway he stops, walks over to take a quick look, smirks, and goes,"" do you finally have a bf?"" (it's worth noting that he's a really cool gyno and obviously, i must talk to him about my sex life every check up; at this point, i wasn't sure if he had actually seen the semen inside me or was just making small talk). i awkwardly answer ""yes"" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. the new pa still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. that's the exact moment that my soul leaves my body. as she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, i see my boyfriend's freaking baby batter dripping off this thing into the floor. once the speculum was removed, i proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. yes, i was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. 

the poor pa looks at my gyno and asks,"" did you want me to clean that?,"" referring to what dripped on the floor. before he could answer, i made a strange ass sound and rushed out,"" it's okay, i'll do it.""

before they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,"" guess your dry spell is finally over!"" we speak casually like friends so i'm not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.

guys.. i am seriously fucking horrified. what the fuck. i'm seriously considering switching gyno's but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. 

also, not using a throwaway because i have no shame.

tl;dr: boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me.

edit: for those of you suggesting that this is an april fools joke.. it is unfortunately not. my dignity is in shambles but i'm glad a few of you were able to laugh, cry, and cringe with me.

also, yes, i did shower. my after-sex routine always involves a shower where i proceed to push my pelvic floor muscles like i am a reborn christian, trying to expel the demon spawn that my sinful boyfriend had pushed into me. although a hefty amount did come out last night, apparently, not all of it. contrary to popular belief, cooter's are not wide, gaping holes, with lips that flap whenever there's a breeze. washing the outside of your vagina does not clean the inside which, if you're not dipping your 'nana into the nutella jar, is where the semen goes. a pap smear looks at the inside of the vagina and a speculum is an instrument that basically spreads open the walls of your tight vagina so the gynecologist can get a better look at your cervix.

in my case, just like ~~noah~~ moses, that speculum split the waves and onto the path that was just formed, onward gushed my beloved boyfriend's high fructose porn syrup. 

edit 2: for those that don't believe this is true.. or that i am female (grrls don't use the the interwebz hurrhurr), here are the screenshots of me talking to my boyfriend after. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/twrhkgz

edit 3: for those that still don't believe me:

https://imgur.com/a/ymzjvjk

also, please don't speak badly about my gynecologist. you may think it's unprofessional but i've been seeing him for years now (prior to my bf, i was single for 3 years and i'm not one to partake in one night stands) and we're really close. as part of a regular check up for std screening, he always asked if i have engaged in any sexual activity and for three years, i'd say no then tell him how much i longed for a relationship. if this happened in one of our first appointments, he would have never acted like this. i have pcos/am high risk for cervical cancer so i am constantly there for testing, ultrasounds, and general check ups regarding birth control/metformin/etc. (we're still working on a method to regulate my period). he's become really close to me and we always joke around because it eases my nerves. it took us a while to get as comfortable as we are with each other and i wouldn't change it for the world. though it'll always be nerve wracking to see any kind of physician especially a gynecologist, for me, it really helps that i view him as a friend. 

to clarify, bf and i had sex around 3am last night, i cleaned up, then we went to bed. today (or i guess yesterday since it's 12:33am right now), was my day off so i legitimately woke up and netflixed in bed all day until around 1 pm since my appointment was at 2.

believe me or not, that's up to you. all i'm saying is i swear on my beloved fur baby's soul that it happened and i am still super embarrassed. in the years that i've been his patient, i have never seen this young female pa before. i do not know if this was the first time she encountered a situation like this but from the look on her face, i can only guess. i'm sure she'll become seasoned in time and things like this wil not phase her. the pa gave me my pap smear and i had to come back in a week to get an ultrasound for my pcos anyway so if results were unclear due to semen, i'm sure we will redo the pap smear. my appointment was at 2pm but i was not seen until 3pm due to him having an emergency regarding a patient to attend to at the hospital so the exam was very rushed since he had a full waiting room. however, i'll be sure not to have piv sex for at least 48 hours prior (very thankful for this advice as i genuinely did not know and this was my first visit where i am in a relationship ever).

i honestly was not expecting this to blow up like this in anyway.. i never even really post on reddit, hence not using a throwaway since nobody knows i have this account *shrugs*. i guess this will become my ""throwaway"" account now since all this attention is making me a bit uncomfortable.

some of you are criticizing my writing style and that's okay. i decided to have some fun with this post since it honestly was an awkward situation. i also happen to be a fan of euphemisms and personally challenged myself to use as many as i could. sorry to those that felt it was hard to read or cringey and thanks to those that light heartedly laughed with me. i appreciate all of you - both the bad and good comments.

it was nice feeling semi-popular for one day, as things have been pretty gloomy around here ever since my dog died but some of your comments have really brightened my day.

"by letting my niece and nephew use my psn account, and ruining my girlfriend's holiday.. update post here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu\_update\_letting\_my\_nephew\_use\_my\_fortnite/(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu_update_letting_my_nephew_use_my_fortnite/)   


maybe you already know where this is going.

my niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. they're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. my niece (who we'll call l), and my nephew (who we'll call w) don't have many games on their psn account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle i am, i game them access to my psn account, to play my far superior collection of games.all was well for about a month. i knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.

but imagine my surprise yesterday when i get this message on facebook...

&#x200b;

""a\_sad\_frog, can you check your bank? ""

it was my brother in law. l and w's father.

""w is playing fortnite and he has 65,000 v bucks, is this normal?""

&#x200b;

my heart stopped. their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.i went to my transaction history on psn, and nearly threw up when i saw this(https://imgur.com/a/qzu4scn)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**

&#x200b;

all told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. by the time i got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. i saw that the playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. that's **fu number 1.**""tell them to stop what they're doing. shut off your ps4. i have to sort this out"".

&#x200b;

i immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **nothing**. playstation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. this is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherf\*ng v bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. for all intents and purposes, i have lost that money. the bank can't do anything about it.

so here's where it gets really messed up. **fu number 2**. my girlfriend is visiting family in the us, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. she will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. that was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than i ever could have expected, and far better than i deserved.

i'm not mad at the kids. i genuinely don't think they meant it. i'm mad at myself. i didn't think it was possible, but then i should have done more research. i feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just f'ed. we're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.

so, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on psn are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.

**tldr:** left my playstation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.

**edit:** a couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. this is true, but it's set up on a different email that wasn't set up on our phones to notify us. it would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **fu number 3** confirmed.

**update #1:** playstation support was closed for phonecalls today, so it will be tomorrow (monday) when i can contact them.",4

"for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiance that i cheated 9 years ago?. for reference, my brother connor is 19, i am 26, and my (now ex) fiance hunter is 28. also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. hunter and i were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when connor asked if we wanted to join them. i initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

we all got pretty drunk and connor had the idea of playing never have i ever. a few rounds in, the statement ""never have i ever cheated before"" came up.

now's a good time to mention that hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. his ex-fiance cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. and unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, i cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. it was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. this was almost a decade ago, i obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

well my brother knows about this so when i didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? you know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). you have to drink to that!""

my boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. i followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. i'm numb. i'm heartbroken. he was my everything and more and i still don't know how i'm going to move on.

connor tried to apologize, but i feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. this morning i served him an eviction notice. he begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. i just can't look at him right now. he ruined my life. after i raised him and cared for him like he was my own. i feel so hurt. am i being unreasonable?",3
"(update) nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/)

i went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. she took one look at the letter from my friend aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

she contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if i heard more otherwise no need for more action.

aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. he wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. i hadn't complained to them myself so i did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

"by falling asleep wearing vr headset, breaking my monitor, and making my parents think i'm dying.. this happened about 30 minutes ago, it's 4am and i'm tired and stupid for this. 

i'm one of those people, where if i fall asleep i sometimes forget what i was doing before i went to sleep.

so i was playing re7 in vr, but it was getting kinda late but i wanted to stay up and play anyways. i started to fall asleep, and just passed out kinda instantly.

then i woke up, my head felling weirdly heavy. but holy shit i just woke up and all i can see around me is a dark room with some tables chairs all i can hear are creepy noises and its dark outside and  i have no idea where i am. 

so logically i stand up from my chair( i didn't even check to look, but i'm pretty sure my in game guy was standing) and run and scream.

somehow my arm got around my monitor( or maybe a cord idk), i also ran into the wall (which made no sense to me because i wasn't even near a wall), and then it happened.

i start to feel hands all around me(my mom), and the feeling of something come in or out of my ear(my earbuds that i didn't know were there), and the sound of my mom asking ""what the hell, are you ok?""

she took the headset off of me, and i see the destruction i did to my monitor, and the small dent/damage to the wall. 

my mom laughed her ass off at me, and told me we will talk about it tomorrow.

"why are there so many popular right-wing ""dominant debaters"" (ben shapiro, milo yiunnapalosi), but left-wing counterparts seem nowhere to be found?. tl;dr: the personality of an ""always right"", dominant debater, is common amongst several right-wing public figures, but i have trouble understanding why the same personality seems so scarce within left politics.

the whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that steven crowder guy from the meme). you see them debating hundreds of people and ""never being wrong""; although usually they're arguing less experienced people.

i'm not taking a political stance here, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

but i never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. hell i can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

again not in any way arguing for or against right wing/left wing. i don't think right wing argues with facts and left with feelings, thats just the result of the image ben shapiro seems to commercialize",7

"for telling my gf's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?. me and diomara (12f) have had a rough summer.  she's been more defiant than usual.  i've been dating her mom mara (30f) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, maple (33m).  both dio and mara have an on again/off again relationship with dio's dad (dynasis).  he's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into dio's life.   typical shitty-ass part time dad.  i've tried to fill the dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200b;

this summer dynasis decides he wants to be a real dad and takes dio in for a month.  good for him, not my business, and mara agrees.  when dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  really mean to me, very dismissive.  a few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  security took her in then called mara, who didn't answer, then called dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  i answered.  they told me i had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200b;

i didn't say anything to her while i picked her up.  i apologized to security, apologized to the store.  i even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  i assured them dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200b;

i'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  not yelling, but in a fatherly tone, i suppose.  i'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how i dont fuck with thieves, and how i absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so i don't appreciate any of this nor will i accept it in my house.  she snaps back that i'm not her dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  from now on, if i wanna tell her something i need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200b;

that killed my soul.  for the past year or so, i've treated her as my own daughter.  i've paid for their housing, i've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  her bio dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  the fuckin check bounced so i had to call him up and he brought cash over.  i told mara about all of this.  she was appalled at what dio said, but she never made dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her dad.""

&#x200b;

a couple of days later dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  i say go ask your dad.  she scoffs and says her dad doesn't have the money for it, so i have to pay for it.  i tell her...i'm not her dad so don't ever tell me what i have to pay for.  she cried to mara, who tells me i'm not being an adult about the situation.  mind you, i never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  mara says dio is a kid and i need to stop acting like a kid too.",3
"if your child is fat it's your fault and you're a bad parent.. obviously there's a handful of medical conditions that are exceptions, but if your child is otherwise healthy, it's your fault. 

you are their caretaker, you control most of what they eat, and you control their physical activity to a great extent. 

if your child gets to the point where their weight starts to cause health problems you should be charged with child abuse and have your child taken away.

you're letting them learn eating habits that are going to cause them to likely be fat their entire life, putting them at a higher risk for a long list of serious health issues. 

edit: i'm gonna try and address some reoccurring comments here. 

i understand that (at least in the states) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. for the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


and on taking kids away from parents i agree there should be some steps before that happens. there should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. but if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.

i get there and pick a table. after waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. that's very strange so i assume she must be after something. free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, i don't know.

so i explain to her that i'm actually waiting for someone and i don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

that's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one i'm waiting for. she told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

and she was also testing me to see if i would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. so here's the thing, i don't know how i feel about being ""tested"". i don't want to live my life questioning every decision i make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

people often think that an area where the waves are not crashing down is safer, since the ocean seems calm. however the lack of waves is often due to a rip current that will pull you away from the shore, and a lot of people die trying to fight it, not being aware of its presence.

it is way easier to see with an image(http://cdn1.theinertia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rip.jpg). if you get caught, **don't fight it**, either **let yourself drift away and swin around it** once you've stabilised, or **break free from the current by swimming perpendicularly to it**.

"for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.. for the last year i've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


about a week ago i went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if i wanted a receipt. at this point i figured i had just used a deal i don't know about, but the next time i went the same thing happened. so the next several times i've gone i've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


i'm thinking something is wrong and i should tell someone, but i kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. aita?

update: hi guys

i thought i had the golden ticket, i really did. 

i thought i had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. the rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. last night i dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


i wanted to ask you fine people if i was the asshole real quick before i went balls deep and pilfered my way through a midwest convenience store chain. i'll be honest i didn't care what people said though. i was high on the fact that i had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


after i made the post i made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""i mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


i made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause i was sleepy. and then i went to perform the maneuver. i strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

it was a gift card. 


i had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, i found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

i'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" but i sucked it up and paid, and now all i have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

"for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?. i am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. they're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

my sister paula's daughter amy is the most successful of the bunch. she's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

i don't dislike amy but she's always been trouble. i have a daughter the same age as her, charlotte. when they were younger amy did a great job convincing charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

when amy graduated, paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then paula has gone out of her way to make amy the centre of attention everywhere. over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. amy wanted to go too and paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from x''. amy behaved like a brat the entire time and paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. i don't mind this but they do, but once again paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

the final straw came last weekend. my son mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. paula, her husband rob, and amy were there, and paula set about trying to convince me to let amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. mark's fiancee vicky barely knows amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. paula said amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

i was frustrated and told paula that amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. i told paula amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying i was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public.

"ketchup is fucking disgusting. a proper hamburger or cheeseburger should never have ketchup. it dominates the flavor and all you taste is shit. if i want to get the tomato profile, i will put a fucking tomato on my burger and not some pasty, corn syrup, sugary sissy bullshit. every burger place puts ketchup on the burger by default, so i have to always ask for no ketchup and have the chance of them fucking it up. you ketchup fuckers should have to ask for ketchup, not me.

putting ketchup on steak should be a capital offense and you should be sent to a reeducation camp. 

it's fat dumb people sauce. its the keystone or natty light of sauce. its putrid odor is reminiscent of filthy hooker perspiration. you can literally judge a person by how much ketchup they consume. ketchup kills more people in america then terrorism and drugs, yet we don't have a war on tomatoes. the world would be better without ketchup.",6

"(va) my son stole a rare toy from my brother. my brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. what do i do?. right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. here is the story.

&#x200b;

last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. while we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. my brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what i know it's one of his biggest hobbies. well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200b;

well, until yesterday. my brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and i needed to return it immediately. i honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a boba fett figure from his collection. he confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200b;

i was furious and took it from him. here is the problem though, after i confirmed with my brother it was his i found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. so my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. i told him i would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200b;

honestly, what are my options here? i can't afford to pay him back right now. if he does go the police will my son get arrested? he's only 15. it was very wrong of him to do but i think my brother is over reacting. what can i expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",2

"swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever.. when you swim in denim jeans it's like you're an armored aquatic creature. the way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. i personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. they (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they're soaking wet. 

also, when your jeans are soaked, they're heavier. it's always leg day when your jeans are wet. 

if you haven't tried swimming in baggy jeans i suggest doing so. it will change your life.

"update coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex's dog euthanized. can i help prevent this?. link to first post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

glad to say i've got a happy update!

the coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). i wasn't working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

the ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. he's also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. the dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn't shown any human or dog aggression. 

police and animal control are very good around here. they assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they'd require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can't be ""bitten"" by the dog without violating it. and the department says they don't allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog's owner but not the police/animal control. 

so the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. i'd call it a win!

thank you all for your advice and support!",2

"thinking of leaving marriage because step-daughter got herself knocked up.... yeah, i know this sounds awful.

my (32m) wife's (35f) daughter (16f) recently announced she is pregnant. 

she claims she doesn't know who the father is. i suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. i mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? it can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.

anyway, moving on. she is adamant on keeping the baby. abortion is out of the question apparently. wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. they're both ecstatic.

the problem i have with this is:

1. my wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. she's still in school and fully intends to go to college. my wife and i will 100% end up looking after it.

2. i am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. my wife works part time and makes very little money. i don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.

3. i wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. she's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. i feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.

i raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. ""this isn't up to you. this is her decision to make. we will support her.""

i agree it's her decision, but why do i have to support her?

as it stands now, i'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. i'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am i prepared to pay to raise it.

i fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, i'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. i assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if i knew the reason they broke up. i said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, i was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day i was scrolling through facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth.

"by taking a picture of my wife's ass. this happened about a week ago.

&#x200b;

i  took my wife to barns & noble to get some new books for us to read.  i was half halfheartedly looking at different books while trailing my wife throughout the store. at some point i realize my wife is nowhere to be  seen, but whatever i'll find her eventually.

&#x200b;

after  a few minutes of mindless wandering, i notice her on the other side of  the store. i also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as i'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, i hear someone behind me shout ""hey creep! why are you  taking a picture of that girls ass!?"" i turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

i  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. my wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that i had to leave. she explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&#x200b;

the employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. honestly i'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. it was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

&#x200b;

tl;dri took a picture of my wife's ass, an employee called me out for it, not knowing it was my wife. my wife left me high and dry until the manager asked me to leave. everyone we know, now refers to me as ""the ass-man"" now.  

and before anyone starts polishing their armor, yes, my wife knows i do this. yes, my wife is more than okay with it. she does the same thing to me.

edit: just to clarify, my wife already had the picture in hand when she went up to confirm to the manager we were indeed married. the manager never doubted her affirmation that we were indeed married. i'm pretty sure she just wanted to show off her wedding dress again.

first of all, i would like to thank everyone for the support, it was really appreciated and it's what let me have the courage to go to the police so i am very grateful. 

i have received some pretty messed up private messages, and i wanted to let you guys know because i don't know how to feel about them, for instance this one: date rapist here: hey i just wanted to let you know you really should keep your fucking mouth closed. i knew a person who didn't and things didn't end well for them. ;) 

(i can provide screenshots if necessary) 

as for how it unfolded: i gave my boyfriend my phone to text s if he wanted, he texted him from his phone as well as from mine. he made it seem like nothing had happened at first on his phone while texting him from mine that i was very upset about what had happened, that i needed an explanation and that i was telling my bf everything. his answer was ""how could you not know i have always liked you? i thought you liked me too."" ""i am sorry i went too far but you gave me all these signs"" ""anyway,\*bf\* doesn't need to know, let's keep it between us, he wouldn't believe you anyway"" and the worst one ""this could still happen if you want, we'll make it our secret."" needless to say my boyfriend was pissed. he then sent a message saying ""what about the drink you got me at the end, i saw you put something in it."" he then called many times but we didn't answer and he ended up saying ""you're crazy, you're imagining things, what the hell is wrong with you?"" then several other messages calling me names that we didn't answer. 

my boyfriend called him and told him that i had told him everything, that he should beat him up and that he would if he ever showed his face again. he also talked to our other friends but not in details, just saying how he acted weird towards me. i don't know what is going to come of that. 

honestly, i just don't want to see him again now. the police has my report and i hope he never tries that again but i can't do much more. 

thank you again for the support.",8

i have received so much amazing information on this post since i made it. unfortunately it is a holiday today and i am going to try spending today with friends. i am, however, going to follow up tomorrow with the police department and see if we can't figure this out. no updates or calls back as of yet... i'll keep everyone posted.

as of 12/31 at 3:40pm est i have called about filing a complaint with the police officer in question. i have yet to get a call back. i'll update everyone here when i get a call back (if i do.)

hello legal advice!

so, here's some backstory:

me and my fiance moved into this new place back in april. we've been living here since then. the town i live in is incredibly small and only has around 150-200 people, maybe more. the cops around here are notorious for pulling people over. there is a major highway that runs between here and cincinnati. they are most always out on that road because the city jurisdiction extends across that highway, they almost are never monitoring what's happening in town. 

fast forward until now. there was a cop sitting at the 4 way in the middle of town that my fiance had passed (she works with horses and drives a truck that's kinda loud). she was pulled over (in our driveway) for this exhaust issue. she took the loud exhaust ticket, paid it, we put a new exhaust that helped quiet down the truck, all is good. right? nah.

now, this guy knows where we live. he drives by all the time and he knows when my fiance leaves for work. he follows me now, in my 2010 honda civic (it's a completely legal car, no real reason for him to be following me) all the time as i do the speed limit, pay my taxes and abide by the law. there is an abandoned house across the road where he will sit at and ""clock"" people, however, it's right across from our home.

today was the last straw. when my fiance was leaving for work, we was headed in from town from picking up our cat from the vet. he is sitting at the 4-way stop sign in town. he sees us and makes eye contact with us and then as i'm almost home begins pulling out. my fiance needed to go to work, so i decided to let her use my car so that way there was no risk of her being pulled over in her truck (even though we fixed the exhaust like he asked).

on her way out, he sees her leaving and pulls up and blocks the driveway, not allowing my fiance to leave. he sits there for about a minute and then drives down the road a bit, waiting for her to pull out so he can stop her. she calls me and says she's afraid to leave, so i tell her to stay for a bit. he eventually pulled off and pulled over another loud truck.

here's the kicker. my ring doorbell has the entire occurrence of him blocking our driveway on camera. i've saved a copy to my phones storage. what can we do about this? this is clearly harassment and this guy doesn't let up. it's a shame when i'm fearful to leave the privacy of my home because this guys following us around in an unusual way. is there any way i can make a city complaint against him to get him to stop? i only fear this will make things a lot worse. cops are meant to protect and serve, not harass and observe. 

feeling lost here, could anyone give me some useful advice?

thanks, sorry for the long post.",2

so today me and a couple of my friends including my best friend were having a casual chat. some time passed and we decided to play some ""game"" where we tell one of the person's secrets that they think we don't know. so it starts with some small things but gradually we all start telling more and more deeper secrets. and just like that, out of nowhere, she says how she knows i've never had a gf because i'm in love with her and don't want other girls (which is very true). i tried laughing it off, and saying how she's crazy, but she insisted that she knows and that i can't lie to her. at that point i think my face turned white and i legit had no idea what to even do or say.

i was sure my behaviour towards her was not in any way indicative of the fact that im in love with her, but somehow sheknows. i also never told anyone about it before telling you right now, so i can't say someone ratted me out. she said that it was the way i looked at her. i never planned on telling her because she's in a relationship for over 2 years now and i know there's not even a chance. but now that i know she knows, what do i do? edit: update tmrw after i have a talk with her.",8
"by revealing that i had secretly hid in my roomate's closet during his pre-bedtime ritual. obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

i lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we'll call them ned and ethan. the three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. the most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out adam sandler's at a medium pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (everyone thinks they're hilarious in college, i know).
the most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. but one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in ned's bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of adam sandler on my shitty washburn 6-string. 

trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but ned was no random college student. ned was the 6'3"" milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. in short, ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. so to me, that meant that whenever ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

so i grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he'd think i had went to bed early), and snuck into ned's bedroom to position myself in his closet. it was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, like this(https://cdn.instructables.com/fya/uc2h/hmvja37y/fyauc2hhmvja37y.medium.jpg). ned's bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so i'd have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and ned, in case i accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. but directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was ned's computer and desk. 
ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, i could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. the 12 inch proximity of ned spiked my adrenaline, and i began to control my breathing. my back was pressed against coat hangers, and i had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and i had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. (artist depiction(https://i.imgur.com/xmlm5bh.png))

as ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. ned did not reach for his glass of water. ned did not opt for the pajamas. ned did not leave his desk. ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

a million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. if i make myself known now, he'd be immensely embarrassed and angry that i had just violated his privacy. but if i *didn't* speak up now, chances are i'd have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. so i was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. it felt like i was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

my hands began to cramp as i awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn't generate an ounce of noise. my legs began to jitter as i compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as i waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell i was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

after ned's satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that i had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and i had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. all critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until i remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. but with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would i get the phone out my pocket? somehow i did, and i texted ethan in the next room over:

> foogama: in ned's closet. was trying to do medium pace gag. ned started wanking before i could start. now i'm stuck in the closet and can't get out. need help.
> 
> ethan: lol right.
> 
> foogama: ethan, i'm dead serious. i need you to help create a distraction for ned so that i can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
> 
> ethan: …we're going to need to have a talk later.

right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). it was 10:45pm on a thursday, but i could hear ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **""hello? why yes ned is here. is everything okay? ned! ned come here, phone for you!""** ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. how this never raised suspicion, i'll never know. it was a cordless phone. there was no need for ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. but thank god he did. i bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some ""stranger"" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

i was forever in debt to ethan for saving my ass, and we never told ned. that is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in ned's wedding. there was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we ""found interesting"" about ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, i was convinced by ethan to write ""that he enjoys anal sex with large black women"" because it would make a fun ""bachelor story"" over 10 years after the fact.

but of course that's not what happened. the best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we'd be reading the bride's, and they'd be reading ned's. and of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. i didn't even know her name. i had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

the bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. he immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. i immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. ethan and i waited for ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. we were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

**tl;dr – hid in my roommate's closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride's best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**

i've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

edit: thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for ned. ned is a really great guy and i'm sure we'll be fine.

"by finding my girlfriend's tumblr. so i've been seeing seeing this girl for almost 6 months now. she's super terrific to me, and i really think things are going better than they've gone in my most recent relationships. we met on tinder! i personally deleted tinder two weeks after meeting her because i was that into her. she told me she did the same about two weeks after that. however, a recent instagram post notified me that she had a tumblr account. figured i'd look at it, because we had each other on other social media's (and i was curious)
big mistake

she's got a substantial amount of followers and notes, but i've noticed all she talks about is her ex and how she's in love with him, and other tinder guys she's gone on dates with. we started playing video games together recently, and i've just found out that her interest in them came from a guy she just spent last weekend with. 

she has no idea i know any of this information, and i'm too into her to say anything. please help! what do i do?
tl;dr girlfriend i'm basically in love with has a tumblr talking about her recent tinder dates and undying love for her ex and she doesn't know i know",4
"when baking cookies, take them out when just the sides look almost done, not the middle. they'll finish baking on the pan and you'll have soft, delicious cookies.. a lot of times baking instructions give you a bake time that leaves them in until the cookies are completely done baking. people then let the cookies rest after and they often get over-baked and end up crunchy, crumbly, or burnt. 

so unless you like gross hard cookies, take your cookies out of the oven while the center is still gooey. i'm tired of people bringing hard cookies to potlucks who don't even know that their cookies are actually burnt.

edit: okay this is getting wayyyyy more attention than i thought it would. i did not know cookies could be so extremely polarizing. i just want to say that i am not a baker, nor am i pro at life. i like soft cookies and this is how i like to get them to stay soft. with that being said, i understand that some people like hard cookies, chewy with a crunch, and many other varieties. there's a lot of great cookie advice being given throughout this thread so find which advice caters to the kind of cookies you like and learn up! if not, add your own suggestion! seeing a lot of awesome stuff in here.

"telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not why we are really afraid.. anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the kavanaugh hearings. resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

the conversation went as such: if you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

yeah. no shit. the reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **or** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). so... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

what isn't outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. the implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* in effect, it was a lie by omission. 

and the above really isn't my point anyways. here's the main point:

*in a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. there are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

so, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* where's the deterrent there? 

another question that i have never once seen given a good answer:

how does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? this is how *most* consent occurs anyways. other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: intimacy with a woman. 

we have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

lastly: i want to be wrong. 

here's what you can do if i am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard i've found. 

i'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that i am *nowhere close* to being alone here. relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. you won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on facebook. talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on reddit at least.  

so, if i am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that i am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

"update: my father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). my step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... i got custody!!!. **edit: per the bots request, i am required to tell you that i live in washington (wa)**

here's my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

so after one of the most stressful months of my life, i can happily tell you all that i got custody of my step sister.

i did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people i've ever met in my life. i told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

after my step sisters bio dad was informed that i would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. the lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. she said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

after her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, i then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. i've never signed so many things in my entire life. because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, i was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

yesterday, i signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that i had 100% custody of my step sister. after i signed, we both cried and cried for hours. we're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. as i write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

the past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. i consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision i've ever made. these events have made me realise that family isn't just dna based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. i owe all of you for the rest of your lives. once i turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

i hope you all lead wonderful lives. give your loved ones a big hug for me.",2
"accidentally watching a black mirror episode with audio description on. not today, but black mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and i just remembered my fuck up. 

said episode was ""shut up and dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

now, i don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. so the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and i definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. but of course, the black mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

i think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. we were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

well, the end was near, and came the twist. normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. we were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? and to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

we were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as black mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. after some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  

tl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.

"by not openning a gift for 1.5 years. this actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. i was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. we got on well and i was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country i decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. i thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so i kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

in the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. it was all a blur but i kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what i think. well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided not to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). we met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but i was prepared and considered that was it.

the box stayed in my fridge for i dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? she went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and i also met somebody else. one day i was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously i still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then i saw a full page note from her. she basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

i just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. i probably looked like an asshole for how i acted when i last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am i..

"by applying for jobs for the past month as ""titty boobowitz"". i've been a self-employed confectioner for the past two years and i recently started trying to get back into one of those fancy jobs with an office thingy again. i should also mention that for almost ten years i've used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. it's by no means a secret identity, but it's also not explicitly connected to my real name. or so i thought. i had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when i received this email from one that i was particularly excited about:

***i have to say when ""titty boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox i got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  

***i look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** 

ooops. my stomach fell right out of my ass when i read that. and of course the most recent thing i had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. i tried to do damage control, but i did not have high expectations. today i finally received the follow up ""you're not moving on to the interview process"" email.  

tl;dr: somewhere along the line while i was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to titty boobowitz in gmail and i never noticed. then i attempted job hunting. no wonder i got no responses.

"for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?. a few months ago, my brother and now sil announced their intention to marry. the invitation to the wedding stated ""no dress code. wear whatever is comfortable for you."" in hindsight, i think they put that there since the event was at a lake. i didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, i should dress respectably for such an occasion, and i have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. i chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

yesterday was the wedding. when i showed up, i noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than i was. i'm talking polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. i did feel a little out of place. my brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my sil was wearing a modest white dress. the only comment i got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying i looked like i'm marrying the sil, but that was it.

a few hours ago, i got a call from sil. holy shit, she is pissed at me! she was asking why i dressed like a pimp, i upstaged her and my brother, and i stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. i referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and i was dressing respectfully. she was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. i told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. she asked if i was that retarded. i told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. i hung up. she spammed my phone with calls, so i blocked her and texted my brother i'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

was i in the wrong?

edit: clarified she said i stuck out on the photos.

edit 2: my brother said i'm welcome to come over for dinner later. i unblocked her number. no call spam, so that's a good sign.

edit 3: had dinner with my brother and sil earlier. she showed me the pictures, and i can kind of see what she was talking about. i told her i'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because i did notice i was out of place and i should have tried to do something. she said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. so yeah, i don't think we're gonna be on jerry springer as far as i can tell.",3
"buying my son's halloween candy away from him. my kids go trick or treating. we live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

when they're young we tell them santa brings every boy and girl a present on halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he'd leave in exchange. 

when the kids get old enough to realize santa is a hoax, that's when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

did this with our oldest two and it worked great. they'd give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the santa thing. we explained the new deal. 

he said ""so then it's my money and i can buy *whatever* i want with it? a new skateboard even? *anything*?"" ""you bet."" ""swear?"" ""yep."" 

he goes and brings us **all** his candy. even every kit kat, his favorite. i was shocked, but he'd been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must've decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 i'd spent all week. 

next day i brought the candy to work. then we went to walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. we met at the check out. 

there's my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred kit kats for $10.00. 

i started to tell him to put it back, but he said ""what? you said i could buy *whatever* i wanted! you swore! i want my candy back then."" 

his candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. and i did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

so... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

i don't know who's more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this.

"watching incest porn. *throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

this happened yesterday. i was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. i will state, for the record, i do not advocate incest. my girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. all i wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so i went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. that's all this was. research. 

so, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. of all people. if there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment i look straight into it. i answered the phone. the old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

cut to my dad and i driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. then, there came the silence. it wasn't the awkward kind. but i guess we just kinda said enough at the time. my father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. he was in the mood to get jiggy with jeezy. but instead of hearing voices worshipping the og upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital q&a: 

*""you like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

my old man unknowingly activated the car's bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever i was listening to last. in this case, it was fucking incest porn. now, i never closed the video before i left the house, but i did pause the motherfucker. yet, somehow, my phone went skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

"by eating the ends off a chicken wing.. yesterday i ate the ends of a chicken wing. someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so i tried it out. i never expected this to happen. 

i must not have chewed one properly. i got something lodged in my throat. to dislodge it i ate some bread and drank some softdrink. some pain persisted but i went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. 

this morning i woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. i walked to the public hospital down the road because i was starting to worry. 

the gp noticed i had a ""crunchy throat"" when pressing on it. he immediately sent me off to get an xray. that showed i have a perforated esophagus. that is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. the ""crunchy"" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. 

to get more information i started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3219576/

they consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. it's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. a few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. they said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. 

now i'm waiting on the results of the ct scan which will determine whether i get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. if i'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. 

tl;dr: i ate the ends off a chicken wing and now i'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.

**update:** a surgeon just spoke to me. i have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. they don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.

**update 2:** the main surgeon just spoke to me. i'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. the critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. so i can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and i need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.

**update 3:** i had a tube pushed into my arm, through a vein, all the way to the top of my heart. it's called a picc. it's how i'll be eating and drinking over the next week.",4

"serious my (35m) girlfriend (24f) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and i'm not into it at all.. so, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. an additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like 'f*** me with that horse cock'. i've never thought much of it, i thought that was just a way of her saying it's big. but she's started to take it further and it's turned into a bit of a fetish that i'm not entirely comfortable with. a few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first i was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. i laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. i said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said i'd do it the following day. honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. i told her no, and i didn't want to do it again and she's back to being mad at me. am i being a dick here? i don't know what to do. sorry if wrong sub, just wanted a second opinion",8
"coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if i don't have sex with him.. so a guy i know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. i thought i had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but i guess he somehow found the video. we work in the finance industry and i do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. the guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

this is also because i went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

so, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, i'll just call myself h, he found revenge porn of me online. at first i was relieved that it was him cause i've known him for so many years and thought i could trust him. then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. horrified i push him away. he then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if i come over to his place and have sex with him. other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

we're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. that day i just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

he's told me that i should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

i feel so betrayed, since i thought we were good friends. and i'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. i've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

if anyone else has dealt with this, how did you deal with a situation like this?

tl;dr- coworker found revenge porn of me online. he's been sexually harassing me and is threatening to share it if i don't have sex with him.

edit- many people are telling me to go to the police. it's sadly not as simple as going to the police for me. he is from a very wealthy family that practically owns the company. he's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone i know if i don't have sex with him. 
also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. i'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

"for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?. i'm 19f and live at home with my family. my younger brother 'mike' is 14. he is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. the boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. they have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. my mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""i saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""they were in our garden 5 minutes ago i think now they're headed to the skate park"". i think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

one of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'jake' is there. we once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
now yesterday i was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. jakes mom had called my phone two times but i didn't answer cause she was annoying me. my boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. we were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. it was all nice and peaceful and suddenly i hear a really loud knock. it really made us jump because it was just so sudden. i turn to look and there's jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. i nearly hit the ceiling i was so angry. i go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt i just wanted to ask because i haven't seen jake in almost two hours ect.ect. apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. i really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. i also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

my boyfriend thought i was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. she also thinks i shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  i feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but i feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",3
"update overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

so i read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, i was doubting if i made the right decesion. i wasn't going to update because i didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days i came to a final conclusion.i want to clarify that i broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

after i broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. she would send me letters and call me a lot. in one of the texts i actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. i was about to agree, but something she said made me realize i would be making a mistake if i did. she said, ""i'll remember to respect from now on."" that sentence made me realize that i made the right choice by breaking up. since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

either way i'm glad i didn't give her a second chance. i don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

on a sidenote, the other day i was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and i guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that i moved on to fast. blocked her and had a laugh i know for a fact i made the right choice.",8
"update!!! -my landlord called the cops on me for trying to pay my rent- cop made her let me pay- now i'm being evicted for non payment-texas. thank you all so much for all the wonderful advice!!! i definitely feel more educated and informed about my rights now. 

i'm no longer being evicted and i got all of my late fees back as an account credit, except for $5, but at this point i don't even care to ask why.

 i used the property records to hunt down their main office in houston(i live in dallas) and forwarded them the same email outlining all the ways they had violated my lease that i had sent to the taa, the city, as well as the apparently pointless (thanks, guys) bbb.

the guy there got me set up with the online payment system that they actually do have, contrary to what the office manager here told me. next month i can just pay online!

he went through my account, got it paid, and refunded me $125 in late fees as a credit. i actually overpaid $5, still, but it's mostly a win without having to go to court. 

i also now have the contact information for a pro bono place that specializes in housing, just in case i ever need it.

"my wife (29f) is encouraging me (31m) to have an affair?. wife and i have been married for 5 years. i think we have a good relationship and a great sex life. i think she thought the same. however, following a 5-day yoga retreat with a few of her work friends while i was at a conference late last year her opinion seems to have soured.

apparently ""fernando and sarah"" have everything we have, and more, because... they're swingers! when he has sex with another woman he uses it as a learning experience to take home to his doting wife (who also bones around) and they have even more mind-blowing drug-fuelled experiences with each other while the kids are staying with grandma... or atleast that's what i'm getting from it.

so i told her flatly that i don't want to have sex with anyone else and am happy with her; and she quickly states the feeling is mutual. case closed i thought, but then she comes back with more reasons the next week ""it gives independece and freedom to the relationship.""

i'm thinking maybe this is a bit of a mid-life crisis thing and made it clear i'm just not really into banging other people because it feels too much like cheating, but she's insistent! she keeps going on and on about her work friend fernando talking about how mindblowing the experience has been for him and how we really need to try it.

so at this point i'm thinking: are you wanting to cheat on me? she's entirely focussed on me going out and having sex with someone else, but i'm sitting here thinking ""what's in it for her?"" it's concerning.

straw that broke the camel's back is today she came home with a picture of ""fernando's sarah"" and a hint that she's down to hook up with me at their place... i'm like... lost for words right now. how do i make it clear i don't want to ahve sex with someone else and i believe in monogamous relationships.

"by using the faceapp everyone's been raving about. so i guess this is a bit of a change from your normal posts but i felt like sharing anyways.

so this just happened like an hour ago. i'm sure you all have heard about the ""revamping"" of the faceapp where you can literally age a photo of yourself. for those who don't know what i'm talking about, here(https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/faceapp-old-age-face-photographic-filter-mobile-app-development-russia/) is a good reference for you.

anyways, so i saw someone post a picture to their instagram and that's how i heard about it. i knew i had to download it and try it out...because why not?

so i download the app, take a picture and set the filter. 

and omg i'm totally old lol. it's kinda crazy, and i'm not gonna lie...i look good as an old dude.

i decided to send the results with the original picture  to some friends and family who just die laughing at the filtered image. we start comparing pics and wonder if that's how we will really look in the years to come.

then a thought pops into my head...

everyone tells me i look just like my dad, and if that's true maybe he will get a kick out of this photo too! so i send it away!

...nope.

he isn't excited, and he isn't laughing. he said it freaks him out.

i asked him why, and assured him it's just a harmless filter.

what he said next broke my heart.

""i know i'll never see you that old.""

tl;dr: i used the crazed faceapp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. fuck.

"for 100% refusing to let my dad/mom see my child for something done 10-15 years ago? /petty. ok so this is kinda complex, i'll make it short.  this acc is just for privacy reasons

-i always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. i never had problems with my parents before this. 

-i went to med school, still living with parents when i was 20, i dated someone who was 23

-dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says i cannot date j. 

-argument breaks out, dad says it's his house so either i agree or i move out. i say it's not fair as j has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. dad kicks me out. mom agrees with his decision. little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-i moved with j, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (i went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-years later, me and j (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (like really small but i'm happy with it). i ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. i let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  he came a few times. 

-today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when i was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. i said never and that i wasn't going to forgive them. bro says i'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, i say that's bullshit because dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. bro says i should at least let mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. i say mom was able to do something but didn't,but that bro's situation was different because he was only 15. bro is upset because he says mom and dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that i am dragging this entire situation. i told him that if he thinks i'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. he's angry and says that i need to move on and that i shouldn't be withholding them from seeing their grandchild. i say that they disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

aita? i don't hate my bro and i (kinda)  get what he is saying, but i just have a resentment for my parents. it's not like i had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks i'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. i'm curious on what reddit thinks. i want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",3

"by not making the bed and causing my wife's entire family to panic. throwaway because i'm still embarrassed and i don't want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.

for background, i usually make the bed in the mornings, but i didn't yesterday morning because i was running late.

i went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. i got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. i checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and i just couldn't find her. her wallet was there so i figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. i started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. i called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. i called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. my father in law told me to track her phone, so i went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. i turn on the find my iphone sound and start running through the apartment thinking i should call the cops.

i hear the sound coming from our bedroom so i go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell i'm doing. turns out the small lump that i thought was just a pile of blankets since i didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. she sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

i had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

hey guys. i first just want to thank you all for all the support regarding my last post.

i've had a free consultation with a personal injury lawyer and have filed a police report like many of you suggested. i let my cousin and aunt and uncle know this and they immediately ended up offering to pay my hospital bill (and ambulance ride) in full.

my cousin gave me a half-hearted apology and his parents told me he won't be leaving the house for the next year and will be severely punished for this.

i've decided not to press charges, i don't really have the money/time for it, and all i needed was my medical expenses paid. i just plan on not going to any family gatherings where he is for a long long long time.

thanks again for all the love and support.

"for being frustrated that my wife is angry about the sex of our baby?. my (24m) wife (24f) is 24 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. she made it very clear from even before she was pregnant that she really wanted a daughter, and she made the odd joke about ""sending it back"" if it was a boy. the jokes all seemed lighthearted and i just thought if she got pregnant and it was a boy she'd change her mind. fast forward to our 20 week scan. we go in super excited and nervous. i don't mind about the gender, my wife is crying with excitement as she had a feeling it was a girl. 

we go in and find out we are having a boy. my wife immediately bursts into tears and i hold her hand, knowing immediately that she was disappointed and putting it down to the pregnancy hormones. she doesn't stop crying the whole day. i let her calm down and try to comfort her. 

it's been nearly four weeks now and she still cries when someone mentions the baby. she refuses to do anything to do with the nursery and won't discuss anything pregnancy related. family are starting to think it's weird, but she said she doesn't want people to judge her for how she feels. 

now that it's been nearly a month i'm starting to get a bit frustrated. it's just such an overreaction. i told her she needs to come to terms with this because the gender isn't going to change. she cried and called me an asshole. i told her she needs to get a grip. i felt awful but i feel like nearly a month of this is ridiculous. 

my wife and i made up but she's still acting the same and i'm getting upset again.

"obgyn will not stop calling my dad to confirm appointments, even though i'm 22 (. (using a throwaway in case my dad reddits, would prefer him not to find my account)

in indiana

i'm in grad school, but still go to the same obgyn in my home town, out of familiarity and convenience. i was planning to switch once i finished school and settled down. i have him listed as my emergency contact. 

for some reason, they keep calling him to confirm my appointments, despite me telling them three times to never call that number and to please call my cell phone instead. things came to a head yesterday when they called to confirm my appointment for an ultrasound and he cancelled it without my knowledge.  

(my father and i have a tenuous relationship, but that's not related to this situation. i will also be switching docs asap)

this has to be a hipaa violation, right? i can't imagine they're not doing the same thing to other women. this could get someone seriously hurt, if they were seeking birth control or anything behind the back of an abusive parent/spouse.

"for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children. saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

a few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. her husband is a light black man. of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. the skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

i pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. she didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. i reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. neither has spoken to me since.

i've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes i feel bad about what happened. i just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because i would be devastated if i wasn't confident that i was the father of my future children. was i an asshole for asking privately?

edit- okay i get it i'm an asshole. i want to make it clear that i didn't think the triplets had different fathers. i'm not an idiot. i thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",3
"update am i in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?. edit: his friend messaged me and said i had no right to ""make"" my boyfriend tell on him and refuse to see him. i haven't replied but this does show me my boyfriend is trying 

when my boyfriend got home i told him we had to talk, he agreed. i was going to tell him how messed up this was and i am telling his friends wife but he talked before me.

turns out i don't need to tell her because he already did. she was upset and asked him to never contact her or her husband again, so i won't know where that side is going.

he apologized and said it was a drunken mistake but he knows that doesn't make it right or hurt me less. we had talked about 3-ways before with women and he didn't think i minded, but now understands i didn't agree. he said he never thought he'd do something like that and he attacked me so much when i confronted him because he knew he was in the wrong but didn't want me to think of him as that guy. he was completely remorseful and i even saw him cry for the second time in 3 years. he said he thinks maybe it was some drunken pride thing over not being able to do much with me. this is because he does have some erectile dysfunction problems and i have had to help him with his self esteem as he would often say ""i just want to be able to please you"" when we could only have sex once every few months 

even so, he went to his parents for now. we had moved to a new state together two years ago where they live but i don't really know anyone. i'm looking at plane tickets to my hometown. 

until this incident we have had a perfect relationship. we always hung out and had great times. only once did we ever have a huge fight, little disagreements but nothing crazy. he did everything he could no matter how annoying or hard to help my mental illness. he wanted to pay for me to go back to school. he believed in me and supported me when i started my writing. he helped me come to terms with my abuse and move on. all the nights he stayed up with me while i cried.

i wish this never happened 

i don't know if we'll get back together but he's giving me my space and being respectful. i definitely need to be away from him for awhile and think about this. he says he'll give me all the time i need and if i can forgive him he'll be waiting for me. 

thanks everyone for the help in getting me through this time 

to all the guys messaging me to say it's my fault and i should be happy he wanted to show me off; i hope your dick gets so dry it falls off

edit: just to add about the drinking. we had a problem with this before where he'd get drunk and act very angry/ rude towards me. going as far as insulting me. we talked about it and he no longer drinks regularly. we just drink with friends now so i definitely think that is a big part of it. this was a couple years ago. it also showed me that he is willing to change for the better to keep us going. but this is also a lot worse than just being a drunk butthead

i also saw the conversation and made sure it was between him and her so i know he was honest about what happened with the wife.

"dog died while under sitter's care - story does not add up (los angeles, ca, usa). my fiance and i were out of town for vacation and left our two dogs with a sitter who runs her daycare out of her home (los angeles, ca). we dropped the dogs off on tuesday. the sitter informed us she was going out of town on wednesday but had an alternate sitter lined up who would be staying in her house to cover things from wednesday until her return on saturday. she also tells me about the vet tech who lives in the front of her duplex who she sometimes uses for ""emergencies"". 

today (saturday) i get a frantic voicemail from the sitter stating that my dog had a seizure and wasn't going to make it. i call the vet and they confirm that he was brought in this morning experiencing convulsions, went into cardiac arrest and they could not resuscitate him. he was a perfectly healthy 5/yo dog with no issues whatsoever when i left him. 

i drive home, frantic, and arrive at the vet to say goodbye to my dog, and am told by the vet tech about the ""bite marks"" he was treated for elsewhere and was brought in with - which i immediately explain i know nothing about. they bring out my dog's body, which has a huge bite mark with approximately two dozen stitches on his spine right at the neck/hackles level. i immediately begin calling the original sitter and alternate sitter to find out wtf is going on. 

original sitter finally caves and explains that he was ""attacked at the dog park"" by a ""pit-type dog"" and she did not get the other dog owners info. says that she didn't tell me because she ""didn't want to ruin my vacation and it was no big deal"". i ask the alternate sitter if the original sitter told her to lie to me and her answer was a ""no....yes... kind of"" and then she proceeds to tell me that original sitter didn't want to ""ruin my trip"" and so asked she and her boyfriend not to tell me, and they felt conflicted but ultimately followed her wishes. 

i wait for original sitter to get back to town. while outside i confront the vet tech who lives in the front of the duplex asking if he knew anything of what happened to my dog, which he denied. while waiting for original sitter to show up fiance overhears the vet tech make a phone call saying ""original sitter told people we've been working together and i don't normally do this kind of stuff but i could lose my job"" - moments later a woman pulls up to his house, enters, carries out a pink duvet from his home, and puts it in her trunk and drives away. 

original sitter gets home and when questioned about a vet receipt for the stitches, gives me a photo taken of a printed receipt that shows services were rendered for the 29th - a day after she was already out of town - and that the credit card charge was entered manually. she cannot provide a physical copy of the receipt and the medications she says they provided my dog (i have the bottles) do not match the medications on the photo of the receipt she gave me. 

she tries to say it must have been a ""brain disease"" and that the dog bite had nothing to do with it... but the vet i spoke with who treated my dog for the seizures said that a) a healthy five year old dog should have survived a seizure so likely it was a bacterial infection that caused it, potentially from the bite; b) my dog should have been held for 24 hour observation after the bite/anesthesia/stitches

it seems to my like the original sitter's story is not adding up and i'm wondering if she didn't have her vet tech friend perform some sort of illegal, back yard surgery to stitch up my dog and then have someone forge the receipt. what can i legally do here to get to the bottom of this situation, and what sort of case do i have against her? i don't even care about the money because it won't bring my dog back, but i want to make sure she is never allowed to do this to someone else.",2
"mn: someone landed their hot air balloon in my yard and my dogs ripped it.. this past weekend a man with two passengers from a local event went up in a hot air balloon, something went awry and he landed it in my yard. they had been there for a bit when i let my dogs out (balloon wasn't visible from the door or obviously i wouldn't have done so). my dogs are good dogs but frankly hot air balloons are freaking weird and it was new territory for them and they went into a mad panic and attacked the balloon (the people were safe in the basket). i coraled the dogs and they got the balloon hauled out of the yard and into a truck.

last night the pilot of the balloon found my email address and sent me several email addresses for information - first homeowner's insurance, second info on my dog's breed and ages, third my address. i can only imagine where he will be going with this.

i know i need to consult a lawyer if this is going to go somewhere but right now i'm not even sure where to start. am i liable for a balloon my dogs damage that literally lands in my fenced yard? since our property is a notable size we have no tresspassing signs around but they're of course not visible from the air.

edit: i should mention i googled and the balloon bit that was ripped apparently costs tens of thousands. so that's why i'm concerned.",2

"for being mad at my wife for dumpster diving?. hi everyone, i'd like some input. 

my wife and i struggle to make ends meet. we strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. this includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

recently our dd dropped the milk and spilled it. it was 5 days to payday and we'd already done our grocery shopping. my wife said she'd figure it out. i know she has a little money stashed for herself that she's gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, i figured she must have decided to dip into that. boy was i wrong. 

the next week i noticed our food was a little...higher quality. a couple of brand name things, even a roast on sunday with asparagus. i figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when i asked she said ""oh no, i found a bunch of money off coupons."" then she showed a few to me. 

they were those ""earn 0.07$ a gallon"" receipts you get at the gas station. she had gone there and dug through the garbage! she said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

i was speechless. i asked her how she could lower herself like that. she replied that she did it for our kids. when i asked why she didn't use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

i'm so disgusted guys. i can't believe she did this. i don't even want to look at her. she on the other hand is mad at me, and says i'm an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. for expecting my wife not to dumpster dive?

edit: ok! i am definitely the asshole. after reading all of your comments, i really thought about it. i talked to my wife, and told her i was sorry for the way i acted. she is annoyed but willing to forgive me. i was actually mad at myself. the reason we are struggling is because i was in an accident a few months ago. i slid through a stop light on an icy road. it has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade i've worked in for 15 years. i'm on disability through my employer but it isn't even half of what i used to make. we are getting by, but it is tight. and i don't know what we are going to do when it runs out. my wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). i guess i was just mad at myself because i can't take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. i'm going to give her a foot rub tonight. thanks for the honesty guys.

throwaway account. indian here.

background

mine was an arranged marriage. met my wife for after everything from both families was fixed. got married 2 years back. we are both from bihar. both educated. living in a metro city currently. we got along just fine.

my wife was earlier very reluctant/mechanical in sex. we were having sex for just its sake. slowly, she opened up and it got better in around 5-6 months. no issues there. i always suspected something was off with her. one day something happened after which she got very emotional. i consoled her, and she confided in me that her father used to sexually abuse her since she was in class 8. started with inappropriate touching of private parts, then moved on to full rape while drunk(i didnt ask how many times). her mother knew, but did nothing as he had beaten her before. she just usually pretends to be sleeping/actually sleeping, who knows. she said he does this when gets drunk (they all used to sleep on same bed). she didnt said anything because he said he would discontinue her education and marry her away.

after 12th, she moved to hostel, and when she goes home, in vacations, it happens..inappropriate touchings, handjobs, bjs, and sometimes rape . her marriage was fixed as soon her education got ever. all these things stopped after fixing of marriage. she said thats why she was so hesitant of sex earlier, but after establishing trust, opened up . i wanted to confront him., but she didn't even let me confront him. think about family honour. what would relatives think if it got out.. it happened to me , not you. i dont want it to come out. past is past... all emotional storm.

this all happened 1.5 years back. from then i made a point of never for a single day sending her to her maternal home alone. always with me. we get a separate room to stay there, so no probs thereafter.

now present problem :

we had a baby girl last week, her mother was here to help her through, and as its customary here, after childbirth, her mother wants to take her home, to meet extended family. but i don't want my baby to go even near that man. she is saying im over reacting, nothing gonna happen. okay fine. nothing may happen with my wife now, past is past. but just the thought of that man with my newborn baby girl fills me with rage. i cant let that man even near her. not now, not ever. i dont know if im overreating, i basically told her if she wants, she could go with her mother, i would call my mom, and keep the baby with me here , but wont let my baby near that man. just the thought of him touching my innocent child, i cant handle it. i dont know what im doing, am i being unreasonable, too emotional or what ? what should i do now ?

&#x200b;

**update**

the unequivocal suggestion i got from here was that i should not let her go . i called my parents that night, and told them the whole story. they understood it completely, but also recognized the fact that i can't not allow her to go (family,customs, relations .. the whole shebang.. people will start murmuring). so i have to come up with a different solution. and that was of confrontation. i sat down my mil, and my wife and told both of them that i don't want my daughter in any case to be near her husband. first she tried to act aloof, but i maintained my strictness and told i don't care what happened in the past, you know what your husband did to your daughter, and i will not let him do it to my daughter. period. get it through your head. after i made it clear that if she doesn't even acknowledge the situation, i won't let her go, she broke down, and started cursing my wife for airing the family's dirty laundry to me. i again, strictly, told her to calm down, take the night and think about it. there was a comment here that maybe my wife was lying, no she wasn't. you could just feel the trauma in a person's body, the eyes, the shivering... nobody could fake that.

i went to office next day, talked to my boss and negotiated 1 week leave. that evening, situation at home situation was gloomy as before, but as my mil had actually acknowledged the situation now, she was ready for the compromise. so i made my demands :

1. i only got leave for 1 week only, so i would accompany them to their hometown for 5 days, after that my wife and i would return. not a day more. she would not try to emotionally blackmail my wife to stay longer without me being there. i would get return tickets beforehand.
2. she would make sure every ceremony to be completed in those 5 days alone, whosoever relative wants to visit , do it in that time
3. she would personally make sure my daughter would not go into the hands of my fil, or i would publically make a scene, i won't care who is saying what. i would take my daughter from him and leave. period.

she was reluctant for the 3rd point, but i was adamant. she finally agreed. next day, she went back to her home alone for the preparations of the various ceremonies to be held (initially she want to take my wife and my baby with her, and i was to join them for ceremonies only, that's why this whole drama).

for my wife part, after my mil left, i told her that im concerned about her well being, as it was pointed out in the sub that her defending her father is not normal. it's a coping mechanism. (didn't tell her i posted it online, or used the words like ptsd). she got defensive again. someone has commented about some postpartum stuff. was worried about it too. told her she need therapy. now she got extremely agitated about how it went from just a matter between the two of us to getting therapy. i don't know, maybe she was hormonal. for 2 days she was pissed. and was definitely not ready to talk about it.

well, we had follow ups scheduled with the gynae. i think here i did something of a fuck up. after normal checkups, i told the doc about my wife's trauma, thinking maybe she could convince her. i was told to go out, and they talked for about an hour. i was sitting outside thinking i had fucked up the whole situation. but when i was called inside, my initial instincts were right. the doc had convinced my wife to confront her past, and that these kinds of situations are actually very common, and people dont talk about it (conservative society). she referred her to a psychiatrist she knows, and we would make an appointment with her after getting back from hometown. situation with my wife is tense now. she has agreed for now for therapy, hope she doesn't change her mind. we are going to her mother's house for  5 days, and they will definitely talk. i guess my mil will try to talk my wife out of going to therapy, same airing dirty laundry shit. now i'm thinking it was idiotic of me to take up this therapy issue now, should've waited for coming back from her hometown.

we are leaving this weekend, hope i don't have to face any more drama there. will update if anything happens.

"shocking my gf sisters boyfriend has a crush on her. i'm 25/m. i started dating this girl 22/f, it's only been 3-4 months, but alot has happened since then.

she has a sister 18/f and her sister has a boyfriend 21/m  who have been together for 6 months. when i first met her sister and her sister bf,  i thought they were cool, we always hung out and even lived together in one room at one point. my gf and her sisters boyfriend got along pretty well, but sometimes i think it was too much. 

little by little i started noticing something weird about her sisters boyfriend. in the beginning i felt that he was too friendly with my gf, like too close but i always thought ""maybe i'm trippin, that's just how they are, it's nothing"" and left it alone. 

then more weird shit happened. 
like one night, all 4 of us went out to a bar, he grabbed my gf and started to dance. nothing wrong with that, but what was weird to me was the way he then started to grab her and dance with her like it was a back in the day basement party. it was weird to me bc she tells me that they're like a brother and sister. brothers and sisters don't dance that way. i ignored that situation and kept it moving.

another time we went out again and right before going in the bar, he decided he wanted to take some pictures. so he gives my gf sister his phone and tells her to take a picture of them. they switch and my gf takes a pic of them two.  the weird part was that if you were to compare both pics side by side and i asked you, which one of these two is he in a relationship with, you would pick the one  he took with my gf. a picture says a thousand words. while my gf was just taking a picture just to take it, the way he grabbed her and looked at her was basically how me, as her boyfriend would grab her and look at her. she posted that pic but deleted it after i said it was weird and people kept asking her ""who's the lucky guy"" .  at this moment i was 80% sure that this kid had something for my gf. 

as time went on and my gf and i got real serious, his behavior towards me started to change. every time i would hug and kiss my gf or show her any affection, i'd feel the hate in his eyes.  he'd mention to my gf how things are different now, how she chose me over her ""family"" (him and her sister). he would make plans to go out to eat but he would make it clear that he just wants them 3 to go. when my  gf would say no, he'd get angry. 

it got to the point where one night my gf sister and her sister bf came over. everything was all good. i wasn't there yet but when i arrived, she mentioned he was being weird towards me. it was like that the rest of the night. 

when they left, i finally decided to have that talk with my girlfriend. we had a long talk about that situation and other things. at first she didn't see things that way i seen them but started to put two and two together. she didn't want to accept the possibility that her sisters boyfriend could want her. she was not convinced but agreed that she might have unknowingly condoned his actions and that she'll be a little less friendly.  

at this time it was 10am, we still hadn't slept. her phone made the notification noise. i looked over at the phone which was next to me, and it read: ""lets fuck"" 

at this moment, we're both in shock. i grabbed the phone and showed her the dm. 

it was from her sisters boyfriend. 

her:  ""maybe that's them playing around"" 
me: ""you don't play around like that""

her: ""it could have been my sister writing that""
me: ""okay then, if that's what you think, let's                  call. if you're sister picks up, we pay attention to how she sounds. if she sounds like she's just waking up, it wasn't her playing games. but if he picks up, you go along with it, to see how far he'll go.""
her: ""okay""

my gf calls, her sister answers, in a groggy voice. like she had just woken up.

gf: ""hey what are you doing?""
sister: ""i was sleeping what's up""
gf: ""where's your bf?""
sister: ""he's laying next to me""
gf: ""look at what he just sent me""
her sister hangs up. 

we call back 15 mins later to give them a chance to talk.

when we call back, gf sister answers. in the background, we can hear that they were arguing. a few seconds later, she hangs up and we don't hear from her again for the rest of the day.


a few days later, they explain that his page got hacked and it was one of his exes that had wrote that. idk how he managed to make his girlfriend believe that but it must have been tough. my gf believed him, but still had her doubts. i in the other hand, don't believe it for various reasons. 

my gf and i spoke about it things and she said that she'll keep her distance. either way i let it go and decided to move on. he would continue to come around but it wasn't the same. 


few days went by. 

yesterday, i call her to talk and see how her day is going. she picks up, crying. she says she's at her sisters house. her sister was being taken by ambulance to the hospital because she couldn't breathe. i tell her to call me back asap. 

time went by and i call to see what's going on. she picks up, i ask her what happened. she says she's home, her sister is doing fine, she's at the hospital with her parents. 

me: ""how come you aren't at the hospital with her also?""
her: ""they wouldn't let us in the room, only my mom and dad, and i was hungry so we left. 
me: ""who are you with?""
her: ""my sisters boyfriend, i told him to come instead of waiting there. ""

at this moment, i am bothered and disappointed. after all that we've been through, you're alone, in a house, with someone that you know i don't feel comfortable with. that's what i wanted to say, but did not say it bc i was on speaker. 

so we continue to talk while she starts to cook. there comes a point where her phone dies. i give her 8-10mins to call me back. (takes 2-3mins for her phone to turn on). she doesn't call, so i call her. no answer. i wait 5 more mins and call again, no answer. i wait longer than 5mins this time and call. she picks up and says her phone died. 

me: ""how come you didn't call back after it died?"" (she usually does right away)
her: ""i was on the phone with my sister, she's ready to leave the hospital, now we have to find my parents and her a ride""
me: ""oh""

her sisters boyfriend finds a ride and leaves to pick them up from the hospital. my girlfriend stays and we continue to talk until she goes to shower. 

she calls back and her sister is there along with her boyfriend. we talk about the situation, and i patiently wait for them to leave so i can talk to my gf about how i felt bothered that she was there alone with him. 

when they finally leave, i express myself to her and tell her how i felt. from that point forward, a 4 hour argument commences. 

- she says that  i have no right to feel the way i felt. that's her ""brother in law"".  and that there was nothing at all wrong with him being alone with her.

i tell her, that i do have the right to feel bothered. it might be your brother in law but things changed when you received that text message from him. i feel disappointed bc you said you would keep your distance. being alone in a house with him is not keeping your distance.

"forbidding my wife from using my daughters old room. this has been an ongoing argument between my wife and i, but it resulted in a huge argument today and i'm starting to wonder if i'm in the wrong. i think it's impossible for someone in my position to see my wife's point of view fairly so tell me who's the asshole here. i'm also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it's solely this topic/argument that i'm interested in hearing your judgement on.

so my wife and i have two kids together. but before i met my wife i had a daughter with my now ex-wife. my daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. we haven't said a word to each other in almost a decade and i have no desire to speak with her anyway.

i still own the same house as then and i've pretty much left my daughters room as it was. at first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it's kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? i can't really explain the logic behind it because i don't think there is any. it just doesn't feel right to change her room.

this has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and i have really had. the house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there's my daughters old room. my kids know not to go in there and it's just left there. occasionally i will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. it's therapeutic in some weird way.

my wife has always wanted to change the room. at first it was because she wanted a study, but i refused and eventually she gave up. 

we're now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. again i put my foot down and said that wasn't an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.

 she really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. she was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. she was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. she said a lot of things but i think that basically sums it up.

when she said these things i was really hurt. but i've had a few hours to think it over, and i think i might be the unreasonable asshole here. it's not fair to make my kids share a room because i won't let go of the past. it's not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn't my first love.

"for using poop bags for my daughter's birthday party?. my daughter just turned 6. we had a birthday party for her on saturday. that morning was pretty hectic. i was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and i didn't notice.

all that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""sarah"" and it's ""sara"" and i said, ""who cares, just scrape off the h"" but she insisted on returning it. so i said ""fine whatever."" and then as she's leaving she says since i screwed up already i should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

and i go into the kitchen and i ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" she says ""the gift bags."" i found all the candy and toys and what i thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. so i make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

my wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt i made at helping. so a little while after that, the guests arrive. the day went pretty well until the end. my daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. my wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until i got the box. she looked inside an was horrified

""what the fuck is this?"" she whispers. and she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. i follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. she's so embarrassed. why? she wont say. i'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. i then i just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically i'm stupid and i've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? i tell her ""it's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. she says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

so yeah i've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. i told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said i was a huge asshole and she's mad that i dont think it's a big deal. and i still dont. actually, i think i'm the one that should be mad at her for keeping this going for almost a week.

"for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?. so i have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when i was 13. i never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. it's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

i worked with him on and off through college and i've gotten very good at it.

he asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after i graduated. but my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

i do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. he also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

to no one's surprise, my father said i needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

i refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. my father was upset but i guess he figured he couldn't stop me. we continued having weekly dinners.

for some reason, people are liking my company's work more. i have expanded my company more than my father ever has. i also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. i don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless i want to.

last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. i admit i did feel bad so i offered him a full time job in my company and that i'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. but i told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

this made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. he said i betrayed him. then i basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

i do feel kind of guilty i ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. but at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

"if tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.. tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. i can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. i have friends who have been fat fished. that's essentially the same damn thing. why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. it's so fucking dumb to me. a girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""you go girl!"", ""girl power!"", blah blah blah. a guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""asshole!"", ""so misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. it annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are. 

&#x200b;

let me be clear, **i have no issue with a woman if she is fat. i am just not attracted to it. also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because i'm 5'9""** 

&#x200b;

yes i'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to bumble, and it's not as bad as something like hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. while this is about tinder's new settings, i think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

"update pa i followed and reported a drunk driver, then i got a ticket for driving past curfew. this is an update to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

i took the advice that i was given and i pled not guilty. last week i went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200b;

i brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that i called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. i also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and i printed out a copy of the ""justification"" law(https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/conscheck.cfm?txttype=htm&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

the hearing started with the officer saying that i was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why i was there, and that i voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. he said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

then it was my turn to speak. i said that while i did drive past curfew, it was because i had noticed an erratic driver and i was following him because i thought he was going to hurt someone. i felt that if i had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. i gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and i said that i would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. i argued that i had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 bac. (the judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the bac.)

finally, i brought up the justification defense. i argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. i said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because i drove in an otherwise safe manner.

the judge agreed and found me not guilty! he said that i had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that i had done the right thing. i'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200b;

tl;dr: went to court. police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" i presented my defense that i was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. judge agreed; i was found not guilty!",2
"a male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. he just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.. spa is in maryland. a friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. he is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. he has not spoken with management yet. he just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

minor update: i advised him of his many options after reading the comments. he went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

i'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. the mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room. 

thank you everyone for the comments. if this  issue comes up again he will be going over their heads to handle this legally. ",2
"by thinking divorce was an april fools gag. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

my borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. they told the family they are getting divorced. i broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying i'm no april fool.

wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

i don't think i'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. this blew up and i just got multiple texts from my wife telling me i fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... and i didn't change any names

uhh this post is getting deleted. it's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

final edit. fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on reddit) how big of a dumbass i am.

"by knocking out the guy i'm seeing. this actually happened yesterday but i couldn't get a chance to post it.  

i'm a pretty ""basic"" white girl. i'm 21, i like starbucks, i wear leather leggings and hoodies, i'm blonde, i have a part time job as a secretary-- so it was not surprising that the guy i'm sorta dating didn't believe me when i told him i've been kickboxing for the better part of a decade. instead of going to the gym and jogging, kickboxing has been a way for me to be active and stay fit. it kinda pissed me off he thought i'm making it up to look cool in front of him because he's been trying to get into kickboxing-- so i figured, why not have like a fun date at the gym he's been going and kick the heavy bags and have fun.  

he kinda laughed at the idea but i made him accept.  

we got to the gym, i met his gym friends, his coach and so far it was going good. the dumbass jokingly said we should spar and that he'd go easy on me-- told me with sparring gear it wouldn't hurt and it'd be fun. there was no way i'm saying no to that. my plan was show him that experience matters and make him believe me that i've really been doing this for a looooooong time-- but no, the asshole didn't put on any protective gear. i got mad.  

we begin. he's laughing, his friends are laughing and cheering for me like i'm some kid-- and i'm just getting more and more pissed off by the minute. the cheering was the boiling point. as soon as my date got close enough, out of nowhere i decided to head kick him with everything i had. i literally grunted as i kicked him. in the ten or so years i've been kickboxing i don't think i've ever kicked anyone that hard. he was out cold before he even hit the ground. 

needless to say, when he came to his senses he had no choice but to accept that i've actually been kickboxing for quite some time-- i also invited him over at my place tonight and plan to make him dinner to apologize for the ko.  

surprisingly, he doesn't hate me and laughed it off-- and accepted the dinner invite which is a win in my book. 

tl;dr: my date didn't believe me i've been kickboxing for quite a long time and asked me to spar. i head kicked him and knocked him out cold.

edit; this kinda blew up and i can't reply to everyone! i know what i did is fucked up and bad and i realize how bad it'd look if the genders were reversed. i didn't post this to gloat and brag nor do i think he had it coming-- i thought this sub is about fuck ups- this was a fuck up on my part. i didn't realize this would offend so many people.

edit 2; guys, i can't stress this enough- i posted this because i fucked up. he's fine and his coach took him to the hospital. i'm really sorry if this came out as me bragging, it's on me for writing it up like this. i hope someone reads the edits because i can't reply to every individual comment.",4

"for wanting my daughter's boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?. i'm the dad of a 25 year old young woman who i love very much. i've been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and i enjoy my time with her, but there's one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

she exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, i realized she needed professional help. throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. with an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. she received an aspd diagnosis at 18, and i had suspected it for long prior.

after her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. she's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. she uses that old dating guide ""the rules"" like a bible. she currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who i have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). he is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

but i doubt she loves him. we've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. when she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. she has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. while she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, i highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. i've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or i will**; to which she always responds, ""i know you wouldn't dare."" i actually would - i really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

i'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. it's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. aita?",3

"if ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for ""free"", search for ""open source"" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware. the reasoning being if you type ""free"", generally you will be advertised to or get the lite version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to.

open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

this has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

edit: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't mean that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

i am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

as this thread has gained a lot of traction let's address some points: yes, we know you can torrent a paid-for application. hilarious as it is for you to keep posting it, you don't need to tell us. open source is still valid for those of us who believe in privacy, transparency and actually supporting a developer. we are aware of pirating websites, i promise.

"for kicking my best friend out and telling him to grow up after he called my baby belly gross and weird?. i've known james since we were 11. he's been my best friend for a long time and we're so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings because we look alike and even share a last name. he lives close by and is very much integrated into all parts of my life. 

i had a crush on him growing up and i asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. he always declined and said we were just best friends. he's really goofy with me, and treats me like i'm his little sister and over time i came to agree with him. we are 27 now and still the best of friends. my parents treat him like a son and honestly, he's family. 

a couple months ago i had a ons and found out i was pregnant. being as i have pcos i am over the moon because i was always told that the chance of me conceiving were very low. i am keeping this gorgeous miracle baby and i cant explain how many tears of relief i shed. i've always wanted to be a mom and finally i have a chance at this. i have my own home, have savings, i'm in the right place in life and i'm so happy. 

when james found out he was also over the moon. he thought it was the coolest thing ever but then gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore. won't go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn't feel like going to the mall, can't come with me to visit mutual friends, nada. 

my mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most recent one i cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had an issue. he confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little gross. he said 'i know it's really weird of me but it just creeps me out' 

i found that so demeaning and hurtful, and i burst out crying and called him an immature asshole and told him to gtfo. he apologized and left and i haven't heard from him since. i'm so upset that he's ruining a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! i want to reach out but i just feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and i'm not sure if i'm the one that's being difficult or if it's him.",3

"(update) surprise divorce, husband cleared bank accounts. update from: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9xicm3/husband_surprised_me_with_a_divorce_cleaned_out/?utm_source=reddit-android

i wasn't able to get much done over the weekend except sell the wedding ring for some food/diaper money. today however was really busy, i spoke to a few people i was able to get in contact with through legal aid! 

i'm told by the end of the week i should be with an attorney who can begin helping me file everything i need to begin doing and hopefully begin tracking down where he's put all the money and get some back so i can continue to survive until i can be approved for childcare through state benefits and begin working again. 

i'm really surprised about how often this happens, there are entire places dedicated to helping men and women who have their wives/husband's do this to them. 

i am filing for divorce, before he can hopefully and for the return of the money into our account and an order to continue assisting with bills, child support and other necessities such as diapers, mortgage etc.

i probably will not have another update to this for a good long time but so many people wanted to make sure i was going to be ok and with everyone's advice to contact legal aid etc it looks like it hopefully might get better soon! i also contacted the bank and other bills that are coming up that i won't make and explained the situation. they are somewhat understanding and hopefully i'll be back at work soon to keep current.

"update: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything?. original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so i got lots of feedback on what to do here. a good majority of the commenters told me to say something. to clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but i was never planning on doing nothing. of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. i just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which i ended up getting from alison, the third party friend. some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me i was a bad friend. some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. well all of you were somewhat right. here's how it went down: 

i messaged alison early on in the day, shortly after i made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. i said to alison that i needed to tell aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. this was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that alison came over too. we all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about mary. alison showed him the text screenshots of mary talking to her ex, and also told aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

what was the most surprising was his reaction. he took it very well. he first got very quiet, and just nodded. aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. he was not aware of the hookups, but he and mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. he told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. there were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. he knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

we started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. he cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. then he got angry. at her, and even more so at the guy. some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. we told him a million times how much better he deserved. he's definitely not going to marry her. 

thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. we saved a good man from heartbreak!

"my son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family. i'm going to preface this by saying i love all three of my sons equally. they are 29, 24 and 22. it is my unequivocal truth.

it's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

after years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and i have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. we let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

i disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but i have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

after losing literally everything after my divorce, i have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. all three of our sons work in the business.

a week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. i was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. my oldest son managed to see it.

our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. my oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

i feel like i have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. my ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

if she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

the plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

my son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. he stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and i. our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

i am devastated. i have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him i want the will to be changed to split everything equally. but the damage is done.

he's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). his brothers and my wife and i are so hurt hearing this. it couldn't be any further than the truth. it's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

he has refused to come in to work since the past week and i've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

i don't know how to fix this. he won't take my calls.

my ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on facebook that i am considering legal action over. but i know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

i'm not sure how to salvage this. and i am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. my younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. it's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. my wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

tl;dr my oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. but now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after i have tried to fix it.",8

pop culture is diligently working to obsolete the role of a father figure in the household.

why do you think there are terms such as ""toxic masculinity "", but no one ever talks about ""toxic femininity""?",6

"just because you are better at arguing, doesn't mean you're right.. i was à german living in england for 7 years. loved it. but whenever i had a an argument with people about politics or whatever people would ""win"" the argument simply because they delivered better than i did.

me arguing in a foreign language obviously makes it much harder for me to get my point across. but even in my own language i struggle to explain well. however i don't think just because i don't talk well or don't use difficult words or studder here and there should ever take away from the argument i'm making. if people weren't so obsessed with showing off how clever they are they would let their counterpart finish what they have to say and listen  instead of seeing their insecurities or shortcomings as an apportunity to make them look stupid or overpower them and ""win"" the argument.

i mean what does that even mean ""win"" an argument. the point is to get to a consensus and not imposing your viewpoint.

if you talk to somebody and they don't express themselves as nicely as you do, be the bigger person and let them talk and try and make their point. your argument should rest only on the content and not on the delivery. and if you find that you can't win arguments if you don't use the trick of being super eloquent, maybe take it as an opportunity to learn and don't see it as defeat.",6
"by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.. this came to a head on sunday night. i've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. she would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. this was fine for a few weeks. then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. i dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. that this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. i wouldnt know.

my mind jumps to affair. the love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. i figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. i basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. she declined, said maybe when she gets back. like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. so i follow her. there is a dennys down the road from our house. she gets out and goes in. im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. i go inside and i cant find her. nowhere to be seen. its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. she finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""how can you do this to me!"" the fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. my wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""you're caught, where is the guy?."" ""what?"" ""dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""there isnt a guy."" ""why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" at this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. in the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""i had to use the bathroom."" uncontrolled sobbing. ""what....you had to what?"" ""i had to go to the bathroom."" ""we have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""i dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""a dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. i just never noticed, never second guessed it. she stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. so many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. her  shame was brought down by bananas. i could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. so, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

tl;dr my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

edit. thank you to whomever decided to award my idiocy and my wifes shame with gold.

edit 2. for the people asking for proof of my wife pooping.....what the hell is wrong with you. you are devin to me now.

final edit. this was posted this afternoon, at 9:31 pm, after reading the comments she asked me to play video games, announced she was going to go buy bananas and turned on every faucet we have while locking herself in the bathroom.",4

"by unintentionally giving my friend a masturbation alert. so after five months of doing this shit i realized today that this has been happening.

before this happened i was unaware incognito mode on chrome was a thing. because of this every time i would go to a certain nsfw website i would type the link into a discord (basically the new skype) direct message to my friend that lives across the country. i only send the links to him while it said he is offline. i did this so my chrome wouldn't save the keystrokes of whatever website i decided to visit that day and show up in the predictive search. i would then click on the link of the website through discord and delete the message. little did i know that my friend has discord notifications that show up on his phone for whenever he receives a message. he basically had an alert for every time i masturbated.

so after i had been doing this for a while he finally decides to ask me why he receives all of these nsfw links in the middle of the day. i start laughing out of embarrassment because of these notifications he's been receiving. i told him about the whole process i go through just to get to a website. after that he proceeds to laugh for a good few minutes and tell me about incognito mode on chrome as my embarrassment keeps rising. after more laughing we moved on.  

i'm glad to know about incognito mode though i will probably keep doing it has i have been because i'm used to it and it's a great inside joke.   


tl;dr: i have been sending nsfw links to my friend on discord for the past five months while he isn't online to avoid predictive search. he has discord notifications enabled on his phone therefore giving him an alert every time i masturbate .",4
"by being young and dumb i guess. *i was 16 when this happened. golden age of fuck ups.* 

i hooked up with one of the girls from my church. we were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. i was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the big g. however the two of us shared one common goal. we wanted to fuck. which we did. but afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". she named and shamed both of us. none of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father.

"for serving myself the biggest piece of meat?. my boyfriend and i have been together for about 2 1/2 years. we live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. we have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. i wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but i do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when i can. bf doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

for reference, i am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. he is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

on sunday i went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. if you're familiar, it's 13er james peak in co. it was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). i had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. suffice to say, i was pretty hungry by dinner time. i made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. when it came time to eat, because of my big day, i grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. we're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

bf got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. he told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. i told him that i'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

he told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. i said that i agreed, but again, i'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. he told me i should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

we've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). so far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. i think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general.

i'm half japanese/korean and half white. for reference, i've been told by multiple people, including him, that i look like kiko mizuhara. (although i don't agree, i love the compliment btw)

so i've known since the beginning that he loves japanese culture. no biggie, whatever. i've dated weeaboos before, and it never turned into a problem. 
somehow my mom got brought up and how i'm more japanese than korean. he got weirdly excited. it kind of weirded me out, but i let it go.

then he said that i ""shouldn't call myself white"" because i'm hapa. that pissed me off, but i didn't make a big deal out of it. then he said something along the lines of ""you're so lucky you got the best features from both races"" and i was so grossed out.
it escalated, and it basically ended with me saying that i felt fetishized and then he sounded like he was into eugenics. he got angry because he said i called him a nazi. (i did not. i said what he said sounded like eugenics) he then proceeded to cry and say ""it's not my fault i have yellow fever"" and ""japanese girls are tighter and are more submissive""

i'm honestly afraid to tell our friends about it, but i'm pretty sure i'm done with him. i've had white guys do kinda racist stuff before, but never to this extent. all of our friends are white, and i'm afraid they'll think i'm overreacting or something. idk. i guess i'm just looking for some type of reassurance that what he said isn't okay.

edit:
thank you everyone who responded. it really means a lot to me. to clarify, we had been drinking a little bit, but not that much at all. i have decided to completely end things. i'll never be able to think of him the same way, and it would always be in the back of my head. the friends i have spoken to totally agree with me. i feel so respected by them, and it means the world to me. so yeah, thank you all again. you all made this so much easier for me. i'm just so, so thankful to have all of these kind strangers support my decision!

edit 2: again, i just want to thank you all! i've blocked him number because he wouldn't stop calling me. my friends are being so supportive- just like you guys. honestly, i'm not super sad about it anymore. i feel like a dodged a huuuuuge bullet. and to those of you saying you hope this is fake.. i really wish it were too.

edit 3: wow! i really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did. again, thank you all. i'm trying to read all the responses because they all mean a lot to me. i just had a night out with a friend, and life feels good. thank you, strangers from the internet. <3

edit 4: i just realized someone gave me gold n silver! tbh, i don't really know what those mean, but thank you!!!! i'm in awe of how kind you all are, and you have seriously made this situation so much more manageable. i can't thank you all enough. i wish i could hug each and every one of you who gave me kind words and/or validation.

edit 5: hey you guys. just wanna give out another thank you. i wish i could read through everything, but i don't think i'll be able to! just wanted to clear some things up:

- to the people who are saying it's my fault for dating a white guy, that's bullshit. not all white people are inherently like this. 

- when i said weeaboo, i mostly meant people who like to watch anime and stuff like that

- i've had a few people message and say stuff like ""there's no way you look exactly like kiko..."" i didn't say i did. i said some people have told me that which is a huge compliment to me. i don't necessary think i look like her, but i do get where those people are coming from. 

- some people have asked to see a photo of me. venmo me and maybe i will lol

- to the people who are still insisting that this is fake, it's really not. reading through all of these comments, i'm pretty disgusted by how prevalent this issue really is

- i'm talking about our mutual friends. i met a couple of them through him. not all of my friends are white, and i knew that none of my personal friends would judge me

- and to the people who said he did nothing wrong, i disagree. i didn't take very much time to make my decision to end things, but i would never be able to see him the same way. the damage was done.

thank you all again.

okay, one more thing. i don't only date white dudes. race has nothing to do with who i'm attracted to.. seriously. i never said i only date white guys. he just happens to be white and our mutual friends are all white. the area that i currently live in is overwhelmingly predominantly white. i do not have ""white fever"", and i should not have expected this.

"for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""?. using a throwaway. some context; i live in ca, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. she's 22, i've known her since she was 4. her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. she's very sheltered by her mother. anyway, i told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. she's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

but then my wife goes, ""and she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

i'm 41, my wife is 42. i was like ""you're kidding, right?""

she wasn't kidding. at first, i was like ""hell no."" but after about a week of talking, i gave in....with one caveat. i told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, i'm going to ask some questions he might not like. she wanted to know what kind of questions, and i gave her some.

1. how did you guys meet and who made the first move? (if the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. what's the end game here? a serious relationship, marriage? have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

i know, i'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

so, fast forward to the visit. niece and old dude show up. i'm cordial. i wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and i invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. just me and him. then i start asking my questions. 

after only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. he told me this is ""none of my business."" i got a little pissed at that. 

i told him he's staying in my home for a week, i can ask him a few questions. and the girl is my niece, i'm not out of bounds here. he told me i was making him ""uncomfortable"". i replied that i'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. i said you can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

well, he left. my wife and niece were upset with me. they said i acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. again, i was told it's none of my business. they have since broken up, which i am glad about. not sure if my actions were the cause.

so am i an asshole for questioning this guy?

edit: some info:

i asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

i would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

when i took the old dude outside for a beer, i neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. we discussed the new star wars movies of all things.

i would love to discuss more with some of you, but i was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. so it goes.

edit 2: some of you here asked what's up with my wife and her sister. her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. they're wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

final edit: some of you wondered if i would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and i wouldn't have a problem. 

talked to my niece this morning. she and i are totally fine. knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. i apologized for my actions regardless.

"update texas my mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. however, the police is still alive, and when i showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. how can i get my cat back?. link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

hello,

first off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. i didn't feel like advice to steal my cat back was 'legal' (thus, being in this subreddit), so i took one users advice to talk to the director of animal control in my mom's city.

she basically told me that the police have no idea what they're doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. she said that the only thing i can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as 'stolen property'. she said the police will understand what to do if a i reference my cat as 'property' and not an animal.

i went to the police station and the police threw me around again. despite i tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn't 'property'. after 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom's texts. 

the cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, i can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my 'stolen property'.

we get to my mom's house and she's not there. we look around the outside of her house and find no signs of kitty either. i call her and ask her where she is, and told her that i was at her house with the police. she said, in quote, ""i took the cat and ran off into oklahoma and i'm not ever coming back."" 

the police said they can't help me since they don't have jurisdiction in oklahoma. 

i went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so i left because i can't afford it. on my way home, i contacted adult protective services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. so i hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

i also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into oklahoma. my mom played the 'poor me' card, so my family bought into it. and somehow, i'm now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... when i got home, i cut everyone out. all of my family. i separated every single tie i had to them.

i've had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if i'm being open about the situation, i was a victim of childhood abuse. that cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me i won't be able to get him back. i ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now i'm getting help for my own mental health. this situation broke me, and right now, i'm trying to recover.

thank you everyone for listening.

"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?. when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

"i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him - update. hey! a week ago i posted about the fact that i slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and i wasn't sure where to go from there. i was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! i think i was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

the following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. on thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. i was so nervous i thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. he said that he's sorry he wasn't around much the days after but i was like no it's fine i haven't been home either, i knew it wasn't on purpose. the vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said 'like maybe you have a good soul if that's a thing' and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. and then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how i felt and he said 'sorry i'm not trying to make this a big thing i just want to make sure you're okay with everything and i want to make sure you feel respected'. i was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. i said that i was fine and that i felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. he said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we're both happy living together whatever happens. i said i agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

it was all really sweet and nice and i think that whatever happens, he's a respectful guy and we'll communicate and we'll be mindful of each other. at one point while we were talking he did say 'sorry we've gotten off track, but i felt it was important we didn't just discuss what happened, i wanted to get to know you a bit. it was a spontaneous thing so i'm glad you agree that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it, and there's no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. we'll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that's all we can do. and maybe we'll have sex again too if you're also up for that.' 

god he's great. anyway, sorry it's nothing too exciting but i had a few pm's asking for an update so i wanted to let you know :) i'm really happy with the outcome and i'm sure we'll be good friends at the very least.",8
"by flashing my breasts...not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job.. i've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""early stages"" feels like i joke because i've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

as part of the hiring process for company x, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. it's a lot. i also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but i *really* hate my job. what can you do?

anyway, i pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me i'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. to ensure i'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, i have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

now, when i'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, i'm working from home for my current job. because i wfh, i'm not always the most presentable. we're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. i look bummy. i'm a bummy girl who works from home. to be clear though, i'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

anyway. i didn't take this into consideration when i opened up my computer for these tests. i *really* didn't take it into consideration when i opened up the program to begin the tests. i only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

and then...because apparently i have no shame??? i decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). this was a super sobering moment, guys.

i really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. so, i stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. while getting up, i haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. i took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. that's when i realized i wasn't wearing a bra (why would i be. i'm wfh, remember?), and the shirt i'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. i started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. i pull one out, put it on. dig through my closet for that single shirt i was looking for. find it, put it on. bam. ready.

i flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). getting myself all situated, i went to push record to start the exam.

there was no record button.

instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. it read something like 00:09:04.

it had been recording the entire time. the whole time.

me cringing at my reflection? recorded. me smelling my sweatshirt? recorded. me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *recorded.*

i had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. for an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

i can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when i realized. i definitely whisper-spoke  ""*fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. maybe a blacked out? i don't know. what i did know in that moment, was that i was royally fucked. the recorded video submitted when you closed the window. there was nothing i could do.

and then...because i'm a dumbass, guys. i went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

so. that's it. there you have it. i might now have nudes on the internet. i might get my recruiter fired for nsfw videos. or, who knows? i might get the job.

tl;dr by not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. i may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire hr department.

edit: i'm not going to show you my titties. quit it.",4

"boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship. my bf and i have been together for over 4 years. when we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. we stayed together long distance until i graduated and moved back home. we have lived together for about 2 years now. 

life was very rough for him when he dropped out. his parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. he is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. because of this, i have lent him money over the years. i was very fortunate in my situation where i went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. i have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. one thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. i am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. he told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. my perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (for example, we moved last week and i wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) it makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. but he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

i am very confused about our relationship right now. he will not remember this when he wakes up, but i don't know how to approach him with the things he said. i love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. but if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should i be doing?

edit: i've changed the ocd to perfectionist. i'm so sorry to everyone i offended!

edit 2: i'm crying at work from all the supportive and caring comments. thank you to everyone who responded, i love each and every one of you, even the rude people because they probably don't get a lot of love in their lives. 

a little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn't work. because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. that was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job.",8
"apartment complex installed ""smarthome"" devices in my apartment without my consent, is asking me to sign a lease addendum consenting to personal data collection and agreeing to be financially responsible for maintenance and upkeep of said devices. what are my options? colorado. i got a notice via email a while back that the apartment complex where i live in denver was going to be installing ""smarthome"" devices in my apartment. i didn't respond because i assumed i would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  i was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while i was traveling for work. 

now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying i requested this and asking that i consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, i am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if i do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""you have requested that we provide insert name of smartdevice vendor in your unit. we agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

i did not request this.

`""information collected by insert name of smartdevice venor (""information""): we have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""personal information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. front door lock:- entry activity by time and code used- technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

this language is pretty much the same for thermostat, smartplugs and switches, hub, water sensor and software to use it all.

`""information sharing: anonymized and aggregated information collected by the service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if i lose or damage any of them, i am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""if a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

what are my options? i really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but i also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that i did not want or consent to being installed.

she didnt like it at all. even though we were slow, used condom and lube, she said it was uncomfortable. this would be fine, and something that we could move on from, but she is blaming me. she says that i sabotaged it because i didnt want to do it. but i didnt. i did it exactly how she asked me to, in terms of speed, how hard i went, plus the amount of lube used. she was really the director here. but somehow it's my fault she didnt like it.

im pretty livid about this. i went out on a limb to try something i didnt want to, just to make her happy. and i feel like after all that she is finding a way to make this my fault. it feels like she built this up in her head too much, and since it didnt live up to it she assumes i ruined it on purpose. we had a fight over this and we broke up. thanks for the advice to those who participated in the last post.",8
"by wearing a halloween costume to school. this is a case of me being a chronic dumbass.

i thought that because it was halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but nope!

not a soul.

nobody wore or did anything to celebrate. i know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion i spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. i'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state i'm only at school like 50% of the time, and i thought ""maybe this time i can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy halloween.

its safe to say i was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if i see someone else with a costume on i might feel better but this was overkill, i'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that i likely wont be made fun of but costuming will always be my passion and someday i will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

"by losing my right testicle in a ball slapping contest. obligatory ""didn't happen today"" but four years ago when i was 17.

also no need for a throwaway account since pretty much everyone i know have heard the story.

&#x200b;

my friend and i were in the sauna and he gets an idea that we should see which one of us could make our balls clap louder by hip thrusting back and forth and i was like ""yeah haha let's do that!"" so there we were, two straight dudes standing in the sauna hip thrusting away and laughing at the sound our sacks made. my friend won the contest and we sat down. i started to feel a little uncomfortable. like someone was squeezing my right nut. it didn't hurt that much when i was sitting down but once i got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. my vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ° c sauna). i dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. my friend brought me a glass of water and i chugged it down in one go. i told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. he asked me if i preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, i said i'll have both. i chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually i require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. i laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level i told him that i'm going to head home. i had ridden my moped there so i had to ride it home as well. it was winter and the roads were bumpy. each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but i managed to get home. once i got home i walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. usually i stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why i went to sleep so early. she was worried that i had been drinking or taken drugs so i just told her that i almost fainted and want to sleep now. in the morning when i woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so i rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. she examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. when i got home from school i showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. there they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. we waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that i had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. a nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. i changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. i was put to sleep and when i woke up in the recovery ward i immediately sat up. a nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. they tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. i started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). the nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. they were shocked about my condition and asked me how i was feeling ""as a man"" but i told them that i just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest.

"for refusing to fire our maid (at my wife's request). **edit:** well fuck me i just spoke with my maid. she says she hasn't seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she's never seen before. from her description i've never heard of him either. she kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. 

i guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. so before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. honestly thought my marriage was perfect i never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.

--- 

my wife and i have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. my wife is a stay at home mom while i work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. 

we live in hong kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. our maid is a 34 year old filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. she lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. 

the problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. she hasn't given any specific reason other than ""i don't want a maid anymore."" i honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but i don't want to fire her because:

- she has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point

- she relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it

- we still have an infant/young children that require constant attention

- i work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. my wife doesn't cook nor clean so i am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone

the woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and i don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.

i'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. jealousy does not seem to be the case here.

thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

"son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.. this has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. we sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. his allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

we had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. we even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

so we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and i can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. he continued to adamantly deny doing that and said mrs gave them to him. 

we then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? he's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""do not worry! this won't happen again"". we have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

then, the very next school day (the meeting was on friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. we figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. we send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. we get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? he should have known to ask to begin with. we are teachers not parents.""

we have no issues for a while until this week. some parent brought in pb&j sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. he forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". we find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. he was not given this one. we spent a day at the hospital.

we've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? the school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. he gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. this is in indiana, any help is appreciated.",2

okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. i'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

a friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. she had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. i don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do i even really know the full story yet. she is not really the prank playing type and i guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

it looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. after i started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. i guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

anyway, i texted her and i told her that i knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. she started blowing my phone up apologizing. she said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. she also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that i was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

i just didn't really respond to her. i left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. my family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. i'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

i don't really know where to go from here. i don't know if i should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

i'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. i'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as i'm awake with this jameson. 

tl;dr: this was actually just a stupid prank by my fiancee.",8

i decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. i atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (in brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points i listed:

1. i appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but i want to do that on my own. i love to cook and felt that i was never allowed in my own kitchen. i also told her that i want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. i don't want her in my room. i reminded her that i talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why i put the lock on the door.

3. i told her that if she wants to be with r, to let r text me and lmk that rm would be in the apartment. 

they expressed understanding and i hugged it out with rm. 

before going to class, i put a load of laundry. my friend is having a birthday dinner today, and i decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. i asked rm multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. i told her that i would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when i finish mine later this afternoon if needed (i didn't want her touching my clothes). she was okay with it and said r didn't have laundry today. cool. i left feeling really relieved, but i still locked my bedroom door. 

i got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and i couldn't find my white dress. as soon as i came home, r looked nervous. my clothes were in the dryer, and i didn't do that for a fact. rm states that i put them in the dryer and just forgot. ughhh. i locked myself in my room, and i know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

when i was in my room, i heard rm talking to r in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. in india, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" and she went on to tell r that i won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

i honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? i'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

i'm heading over to my parents right now and i'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. i'll keep you posted.

"by playing music for a sex dungeon. i currently live in an apartment building in seattle. nearby my unit is a man named ""frank"" and his girlfriend (who is quite vocal, thus why i know her boyfriend's name). now frank and his girlfriend have incredibly loud sex throughout the entirety of friday and saturday nights. annoyed by all of the sound and trying to find a way to blot it out, i began a habit a few months ago of playing music (singing, playing guitar) whenever they would start doing the dirty over the course of the last couple months. as an added bonus, i could hear my neighbors yell ""sing"" throughout the night, so i assumed that my playing was a helpful solution to an unfortunate circumstance borne by all of the other neighbors around me.

&#x200b;

however, tonight, i noticed something kind of strange. they were having sex, per usual, and i began to play music to cover up the sound. i stopped to drink some water between songs, when some of my neighbors started yelling ""play."" for some reason, though, i didn't do anything for a few seconds, and i heard the guy, frank's, voice call out ""keep playing or i'm not going to cum"" through the walls. i listened a while longer to see if i'd heard correctly, and they both kept moaning the same thing. it was at this point that i came to a terrible conclusion. in my attempts to cover up the sound of them having sex, i managed to pull some weird pavlovian trick where whenever they had sex, i played guitar and sang. thus, whenever i started to play guitar to cover up an original sound, it just added to their voyeuristic thrill and they started to depend upon it to finish. when i'd heard my presumed neighbors yell sing, it was actually frank and his girlfriend. unsure if i was right, i started playing another song and when i finished, they were going as hard as possible and moaning heavily so i figured that i'd assumed correctly.

&#x200b;

my neighbors them get understandably angry that my music playing has made this neighbor couple have sex, so then ***they*** begin to have really rough revenge sex against my wall because they think that i've caused this problem (which i have). at this point, i'm listening to frank and his girlfriend and the couple next to my wall, one couple horny and one full of revenge, and all of this was because i tried to save myself from listening to sex in the first place.

&#x200b;

edit: here's a video i uploaded as proof that i'm actually playing music. they weren't having sex this morning, so everyone will have to leave that part to their imagination.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyop3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyop3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be)

2nd edit: wow, this really blew up. hopefully everyone enjoyed the story! regarding proof of their sex, i'm not going to record the sound of my neighbors screwing and upload it to the internet, so my apologies there. to answer everyone's questions, the song is an original, but i've never recorded anything professionally and i play as a hobby. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr: thought i was covering up sex sounds with music, turns out i was serenading a couple while they fucked and keeping them horny all night. neighbors had angry sex against my bedroom wall as revenge for disturbing their sleep because i acted as a musical facilitator.",4
"reddit has become the place where the childhood bullied become the bullies. let me explain. the reddit community is the most condescending trash i have ever seen. they constantly put others down to bolster their own insecurities, subs like r/trashy serve this exact purpose of 'we're better than them.'

now for my title, in highschools of old (maybe 5-10 years ago) nerds, geeks, and just non popular people would be bullied, most of these people now make their way onto reddit.

the majority of people here are extremely critical of intelligence to the point where it could be considered bullying. you get one thing wrong they will pounce onto you and just shut everything you have to say with 'you're not smart, remember when you said this.' one of the biggest targets is the general populace, who are heavily subject to the 'superior' redditors. this is just used to treat their insecurities in saying 'we're special and different right? we're smart' no you're not, you're literally a clone of every neckbeard redditor on the site so stfu",6
"am i being a prick?. basically my so (26f) is unemployed and has begun spending £80 a week renting a horse. her total income is about £130 a week in benefits including child maintenance and we obviously have bills to pay for and rent. i didn't think it was really an option to spend that much money so she could see a horse from time to time but she feels it's completely justified. she's quick to criticise my choice to go out for some drinks maybe once every month or two and i do work full time. for the sake of peace i've told her i'm happy with her decision as long as she can continue contributing towards rent (£35 a week for her) but she's really pissed off that i insisted she explain how she's going to be able to afford it. what do you think, was i an asshole to question her choice?",8
"for showering my niece?. obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. also a heads up i personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that i feel like i'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what i actually did wrong. 

so last weekend i  25m was watching my niece 3f. i have a daughter 5f myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. on this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. what was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. seriously i went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when i came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. i immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. i helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while i washed hers. 

i thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly i didn't even think twice about doing it. my sil does not agree. she keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that i should've called her to okay it first. that mindset is kinda confusing to me. like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who i always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of atlantis. plus, what was i supposed to do? let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? however, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when i'm a man and not her dad. are they right and i'm missing the point or am i right that there's nothing weird about it?

eta: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so i'll address them. 

1. my daughter's mother is dead and i'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. idk if my sil was abused. will throw out there though that i was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and i as kids.

3. i was *not* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think i was. i never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

5. thanks whoever gave me silver.",3
"hunters shot house again, broke window. my parents live in a rural area and are surrounded by woodlands that they do not own. a couple years back a hunter shot in the direction of the house and broke a window. the cops came out, the hunter apologized and paid for the window, but nothing really came of it.

now it's happened again (different window, same scenario, possibly different hunters-not sure). the hunters are friends of the guy who owns the land, and the owner is upset (as he is also friends with my parents), but i feel like that isn't enough. what can/should be done?

"by getting google to ban our entire company while on the toilet. **tldr; company uses google accounts that are all connected. i fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the google account, and all associated accounts. everyone in my company is now blocked by google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

preface, this happened on friday and is still on-going. i've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so i won't be outed since i guarantee someone will read this eventually. i still do not know if i am the culprit, but i am 90% sure that i am. i feel like this is a fireable offence and i will step up and take it if it comes to that. i'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

i work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. we migrated to gmail and other google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. it's safe to say that everyone is using gmail or google in one way or another. now, our gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

i have a friend who creates android apps on the side. i do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called titanium backup. 

as a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), i buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. after that, i send him an e-mail with the cloned version through gmail with something along the lines of: ""look at this cool app i found on the store, it was completely free! try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. it was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

recently he uploaded a new app and i did the same thing as usual. i was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. i was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. i e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

about an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their google accounts. at the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

one of my colleagues requested help and i went to check it out. it turns out that their account was blocked by google due to tos violations. their google payments account was blocked as well. i thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. we got banned by google, all of us. 

the afternoon was pandemonium. we were all freaking out, our it guys were trying to get a hold of google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. we could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. all our work was shared with google services.

eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. it wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. one of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

anyways, we were all told to go home on friday. i went home and looked this up myself, and i found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the google payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. it bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how i said all our work accounts were connected?

yeah...

so it's been two days now and we've been chatting over skype, no one knows what happened and the it guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that google isn't helping us out. their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. the posts i've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

so yeah, that's that. i'm 99% sure that i am the culprit who caused this. i do not know why google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but i fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. i might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**edit1:** this blew up pretty quickly. luckily, i have 3 pms from people close to, or reps who can help me out. if i missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. i am in touch with one of them now and i am getting in touch with it at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. i will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out.

"the whole if ""you stay with your parents past 18 you are a loser"" needs to stop.. i got kicked out the day i turned 18. why? my parents think that should be the culture.

i had just a few thousand saved and went off to college! nearly got broke due to the mass of bills i had, and not being able to support myself on working while at university. i nearly went homeless. i really wanted to go home and save up for a few months.

i asked, and nope. the words of my father was ""be a man"" k dad.

"my family is abusive and i want to emancipate myself. i'm a 16 year old girl. i live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. my maternal grandfather also stays with us. my parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - i was in the car but i survived - and i was taken in by my maternal aunt. my dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

the last two years have been hell for me. not only because i still can't get over losing my parents (i cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. my mom was actually estranged from her family. she was white, and my dad was black. her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. they have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and i guess i'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

they have told me just that on several occasions. that my existence is a mistake. i get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. and i'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. sometimes it gets physical. sometimes it feels like i'm trapped in a minefield. i have to be so careful about where i step cause the repercussions may be explosive. my ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. he has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

i can't live like this anymore. i'm an absolute emotional mess. i wanna emancipate myself but i don't know how to go about it. i know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 i'm close with a set of twins at school - i'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. their parents own a farm and i work regularly with the family. i'm also into photography and i've been doing real good with shooting weddings. they are very lucrative and i've saved up a substantial amount. with summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but i also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

the parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. i've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. i don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

i would really appreciate advice.

thank you

"i (37m) just inadvertantly stumbled upon some suspicious activity with my wife (36f). so our phone bill came due but it was more than usual so i gave it a once over to see where the extra charges came from. turned out to be new activations, no big deal. although, while on the main page i noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. i expect her to have a lot of texts. i got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when i text her at work cause shes busy.....who could she be texting? i decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

i honestly dont know what to think. my curiosity got to me and i started plowing through old phone bills. this number started showing up on august the 8th. since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. often into the wee hours of the morning. shes never mentioned any new friends... 

so i get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and i start helping her find it. i found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. i hate being that guy but i did it. checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. some dude . she has him programmed first and last name. checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and i also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

i love my wife and i trust her completely, i think. i dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. and actually now that i think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. 😕 i really dont like the direction this is heading. am i reading to much into this? we've been married for 6 years and have 2 kids. we havent had a date in months and havent had sex in even longer than that. not for lack of trying on my part. shes gained a little weight and says she just always feels gross. anyone have any advice?

"for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   i've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. you can skip to the tl;dr if the exposition is too long.

she's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which i honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. she can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

if you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' when someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(it doesn't stop there, she knew i had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as i walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. it's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

that's not it, either. she *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, bam, i'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

it's gotten to the point where i don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, i've saved up more being with her than i ever had in any other relationship. the only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

our anniversary was recently, and i had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so i suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""i'm not learning how to make sushi because then i'll *never* get a real date ever again."" we ended up going out instead.

it kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. she's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like olive garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that i'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because i've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

she also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste i've ever seen so i kinda think it's just an excuse.

i just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

tl;dr: so, reddit, am i the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because i practically have a private chef of my very own?

edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, i just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

edit 2: i'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. i'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

edit3: no, twitter, i don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. i buy her herbs and succulents. what flowers do i buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

also, yes, i wash the dishes

#final edit:

okay guys. this will probably be my last edit. this post exploded unexpectedly and i've tried to respond to as many comments as i can, but there's just too many of you. if you've asked me a direct question and i haven't answered, i'm sorry. my inbox is a mess.

i really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and i can honestly say that i've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. it's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

so her mom picked up the girls and i took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. she was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and i apologized for being stupid. after, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so i asked her to marry me.

she said no. she did it kindly, but she still said no. she said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

i'm pretty heartbroken. i thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

so, reddit, you were all right. i'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

we just returned home from our vacation, and the last two days were hell on my imagination. i know i said in the last post that i wasn't going to do anything about it, but i found that i couldn't just sit there and pretend everything was alright. 

so i spoke to my brother.

we were alone, though our mother was in the house. it filled with lots of crying. he basically confessed to having those fantasies, but said that he would never hurt me in real life. i only read one of the stories, and apparently many of his other works also included me. i told him that he already did and he promised to stop publishing new ones and to get rid of/change the old ones. 

he asked that i not tell anyone about it (would ruin his life, he said) and in exchange agreed that he was going to get therapy when we both return to our colleges in the fall. sounded fair, so i agreed, and we ended the convo with a hug at his request. 

in a sense, it felt like a really weird break up. not sure how to better describe it. we most definitely will not be able to have what we used to have in the past, and i hope any awkwardness at future family events can be overcome by time/distance and a butt load of therapy. i'm glad it was sorted out, although that convo was definitely one of the most awkward ones i ever had.

although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.

""no, no, just name anyone else,"" dave says.

""president obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""yup,"" dave says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go. 

at the white house, obama spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""pope francis,"" his boss replies.

""sure!"" says dave. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.

dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope.""
he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.

sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, ""what happened?""

his boss looks up and says, ""it was the final straw... you and the pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with dave?'",0

"update does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18? oregon. previous post a month ago over here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9g6uwn/does_a_child_who_didnt_see_one_parent_because_the/).

i'm safe, and i'm out.

i organised a place to stay with a coworker. i have new bank accounts and all my paperwork. my dad has some regular sport meetings on saturdays that go for hours so i prepared everything the week before, found where my paperwork was and walked out. i've been approved for a rental and i move there soon.

i contacted two police stations near us beforehand who both understood dad's nature straight away when i told them he'd been telling me i couldn't move out because of a time debt and they told me it wasn't a thing. 

i took copies of all of his paperwork too because while i was getting ready to move i found most of what i knew about my parents separating was a lie. there was never a 50/50 custody agreement and my mother never ran off with me in violation to that. my dad had been held for several domestic violence incidents when i was a child and he was only to see me on special holidays and only under strict supervision. he's never been violent to me, but in the papers he had hidden was evidence of a trust available to me when i'm 21. some of the specific wording is it can go to me as an individual or to my carer if that is required. i think my dad was trying to make himself up as my carer without me knowing. i did not find the letter i read when i was a kid from dad's lawyer but like you all said that was probably fake.

after i moved out my dad did try to contact the police. they came to my coworker's address because they had to, but also let me know that yes my dad was trying to say i couldn't look after myself. his words were that i was ""borderline retarded and being abused"".

i've been back to canada to visit my aunts and uncle, and found the aunt who was named to manage my trust died very soon after my mother. we're still working out the details with a canadian lawyer about some confusion over who handles what and how now but i have the full support of my remaining aunt and uncle who are the same great people i remember. they were really worried about me when i went to live with dad and had tried to contact me so many times.

"update if i don't go on a second date with a larger lady because she doesn't match her tinder pics?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/axpo27/wibta_if_i_dont_go_on_a_second_date_with_a_larger/

hey again everyone. i finally have answers.

i never gave fake names to anyone so my date is now alice and her sister is gabby.

on saturday i got a facebook message from gabby. it boiled down to ""this is stupid, will you meet alice so she can properly explain?"" i try to get an explanation straight from her, but she refused and so on sunday i go to a coffee shop to figure out wtf is going on. 

she was cute, my crush was strong, but i managed to sit down with a decent poker face. she pretty much burst into tears the moment i arrived. lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and i really nearly bolted bc i felt so awkward. 

gabby was the one to suggest alice use her pictures. alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on tinder. all of herself... and she was bigger. 

i feel really fucking dumb. still. alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn't have any flattering pictures bc she's continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn't know how to portray that on tinder without scaring everyone off. so that's why gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she's close if i'm being honest, not that i care. never did just thought i was being lied to).

when i sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean. i'm the first guy she's gone on a date with that wanted a second date so... fuck. sucks to be all those other guys i guess because i'm taking her out this weekend again. 

i'm gonna be cautious moving forward bc that was a shit ton of drama for a first date, but i don't know. maybe i'm being dumb? she's real sweet and we share the same hobbies and she's even pretty when she cries and my pa always told me that's how you know you're in it for the long haul and holy fuck i need to calm my crush down. this feels like high school again.

and that's that. just wanted to clear up the catfish fiasco since i got a good many comments and pms. thanks again for helping me set my head on straight.",3

"by rubbing my ass into a security guard's crotch... out of habit.. normally, students can beep into my school with an id card.

it's rfid, and pretty reliable, so most people don't take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.

i'm a junior, and i've been getting into the building the same way for years. i keep my id card in my back pocket, so i just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. that sounds a little weird to write, but i promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and i'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.

only issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. as a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our id out to show him as we walked in.

coming in at 8:00am, after years of habit... i was on autopilot.

i approached the security guard, he said, ""id?"" and i nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (obviously i didn't hear the beep, so i guess my brain thought i wasn't close enough to the ""reader""?)

it all took about two seconds, and when i felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, i suddenly realized what i was doing... but before i could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all ""woah woah woah! miss! i just the need the id, please, not a lap dance!"" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.

i tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. couple of other students saw so i'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.

tl;dr: decided i could bribe my way into school without an id by giving the security guard a lapdance... i was right.",4
"update 1 year later- i 28f gave my boyfriend 28m an engagement ultimatum and i might be regretting it. original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

tl;dr: my boyfriend and i have been together for 4.5 years, moved to a new city together, and live together, but i had not been able to get him to have a serious discussion about where the relationship is going/whether he sees us getting married (i've known that i want to marry him for about 2 years, so i've been trying to bring up the topic for about that long). i was getting frustrated, (i would like to have kids, and my time to do so is limited) so i told him in september that we needed to be engaged by 3/31/18 (when our lease expired) or i was going to move out.

&#x200b;

update #1 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/861lrl/update\_i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/861lrl/update_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

tl;dr: written 10 days prior to the ultimatum deadline, my boyfriend said he wasn't planning to propose. his asked me to stay with him and assured me that he would propose in december 2018 if i visited his family in their home in september and he spoke with them about his plan to propose to me. his reasoning was that i had to visit his family in their home before he felt comfortable taking the next step (i had spent time with his parents in the past, so this didn't make sense to me). i was frustrated but planning to stick to my guns.

&#x200b;

now, on to the current update:

***march 2018***: i couldn't go through with the ultimatum. i was planning to move out, actually found a new apartment, and wrote the check for the deposit. but when push came to shove, i couldn't picture my life without my boyfriend. i decided that i loved him too much to leave him over the arbitrary deadline that i had created. i also believed that he meant what he said about getting engaged in december. i felt i was being silly for leaving him after 4.5 years because i wouldn't wait another few months. as a compromise, he said we could get a cat (i had been wanting one but he'd been saying no), and he said he'd go to at least one family event with me this year. on 3/31, the day i was planning to move out, we got a cat together.

&#x200b;

***april-september 2018***: my boyfriend and i spent time enjoying each other without really mentioning the ultimatum. we both needed to recover from the damage it did to our relationship. i got a therapist and started working on myself. i picked up a new hobby (running), developed new friendships, and spent a lot of time working on my career and hanging out with my amazing new cat. i think focusing on myself/my career/my friendships took some of the pressure off of him. also, multiple family events came and went, and my boyfriend had an excuse not to attend each one. i'm not sure it was that big of a deal anyway. by the end of the summer, we were doing great and it was like the ultimatum never happened. he also complaints about our cat constantly.

&#x200b;

***september 2018- visiting his family***: as i promised him, i went to visit his parents in their home in september. as i mentioned in the previous post, he is chinese-american (and i'm white), so i studied up on my basic chinese and was able to speak/understand a little when we were all together. it was a great trip, and i genuinely enjoyed his parents and had a lot of fun in his hometown. i left a few days before he did so that he'd have time to spend with them alone (and speak with them about his plans for us in the future). i asked him a few times how that conversation went, and he said that they are happy with us having a future together, but that getting engaged in december would be ""too fast."" that seemed absolutely crazy to me, and again it seemed like he was projecting his own views onto his parents. he also told me i needed to learn chinese before we got married (his parents speak perfect english but prefer chinese when they are with family), so i started doing rosetta stone.

&#x200b;

***october-december 2018***: around november, i started getting antsy that my boyfriend was going to change his mind again. he was starting to show his pattern of making excuses. for instance, one day he casually mentioned that he couldn't propose by december because he needed to save money (we share finances and money is not an issue for either of us). another time, he freaked out that i have student loans (most people in my profession do, and i have a very secure job, good pay, and automatic loan payments), and demanded that he see a spreadsheet of my finances before he could consider having a future together. luckily i already have this spreadsheet, which i showed him, and he calmed down.

in the meantime, my friends and family were starting to ask questions about the future wedding. although they had the best intentions, it was stressing me out because i was worried that after all this, there would be no wedding. i worked with my therapist on letting go of this stress, redirecting my family away from relationship questions. i also created a ""no nagging"" rule in my mind-- i stopped dropping hints, mentioning wedding/engagement, etc with my boyfriend (didn't do it much anyway, as i had learned my lesson from the ultimatum). we spent christmas together for the first time this year, and i really thought he would propose then. but he didn't, and i didn't bring it up or pout about it. he visited his family for new years and i was left in our city working, so it definitely didn't happen then.

&#x200b;

***january 2019:*** i accepted that he actually didn't follow through with what he said he would do, despite me holding up my end of the deal. i was the perfect girlfriend that he asked me to be, and i tried to use this an an opportunity for growth (both individually and within the relationship), and still nothing changed. i was still on the momentum of not nagging him and trying to suppress all of my thoughts of wanting to marry him. it's now to the point that i equate my own thoughts of marrying him with shame and self-loathing, like they are bad thoughts that i shouldn't have. i realize i've been feeling so embarrassed with my own desires for my future, which is so sad. but a few things have happened in the past few weeks that have made me realize that this is all bullshit. first, one of my superiors at work offered me some great opportunities at my job if i stay onboard long term. however, my boyfriend wants to think about moving us out of the city we live in because ""we don't like it here"" (i am actually okay with it for the most part). he also has given a hard no to ever moving back to my home state (his reason: my family lives there and they annoy him). i started thinking 'wow, this person is putting a lot of limits on my life for someone who still can't commit to me for the long term.'

then, this weekend i went back to my home state for my best friend's baby shower. also, i want to have kids, that's the main reason i am in any hurry to get married (biological clock is ticking). so yesterday, i was hanging out with my friend and her husband, helping them set up their nursery, and i had this ""aha!"" moment where i realized that it's okay for me to want to get married and have kids. there's no shame in having my own wants. and at this point, not only have my wants/desires been shut down by my boyfriend (no marriage, we can't stay in the city where i have job opportunities, we also can't live in my home state where my entire family is), but i've internalized this sense of shame about expressing or feeling anything that conflicts with his desires. so i'm starting to form a plan to move on, because this dude is taking more from my life that he's adding to it.

&#x200b;

i'm hoping to get anyone's opinion/advice/support about where to go from here. also i am willing to hear all the ""i told you so'"" from everyone who said i needed to leave this guy in march when i said i would. i totally deserve it. thanks for reading!

&#x200b;

***update***: wow, thank you reddit for the super thoughtful replies! i read each one (so far)! 

i spoke with my boyfriend last night about all of this. i started by asking what his roadblocks are and where he sees the relationship going. he brought up the fact that it's moving too fast for his parents, and some issues that he has with the relationship: 1. that we don't make decisions together (e.g. the fact that i want to stay in our city for career opportunities despite him wanting to move next year, also sometimes i make plans to hang out with friends on weekends when he is free instead of us planning the weekends together), 2. he worries about  the fact that i get a lot of amazon packages and he doesn't know what i am buying (showed him my amazon history, it's mostly household supplies that we both use, and occasional supplies for my hobby, but that's like $20/mo max). also this is all on my credit card (which i comfortably pay off each month) so i don't think i need to clear every purchase by him, and 3. he also doesn't like that i'm chronically 5 minutes late to everything (that's true and my fault). also, since it came up a lot in the comments, i wanted to mention that he explicitly said that none of this has to do with cultural barriers or the fact that we're an interracial couple. 

however, after all this, he said he's not ready for marriage. i was pretty pissed and told him i wished he told me this a year ago so i could have moved on. he basically tried to keep me around for another year so that he would have more time to figure out if he was ready. so i told him the relationship is over, and he is appearing to be in disbelief. he's trying to be really nice now (probably to get me to change my mind), but i'm remaining gently firm here.",8
"i 26m upset a woman 20sf and my friends are acting like i'm in the wrong.. hey guys.

i went out clubbing last night with my friends. there were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. my girlfriend hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. i offered to stay in with her but she insisted i go out and have a good time. 

at the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. they were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

one of them, lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. she was pretty but i was not interested as i have a girlfriend. i told her this but she then started asking for pics of hannah. i showed her and she said that i ''could do better than that''. i was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

later me and my friends were dancing, and lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. i gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. a while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. she smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. i was absolutely fuming and in response i poured my beer on her head. she started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. i understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like i was wrong to pour my drink on her. they all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

the ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when i pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

nobody said goodbye to me last night and i made my own way home. i told hannah what happened and she agrees that i didn't do anything wrong. i tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

how do i sort this out in a mature way?

"update for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?. original thread(https://old.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/)

my wife went yesterday to collect our winnings and they shorted her $500. my wife is of the timid type and didn't want a conflict so she took the reduced winnings and had a few choice words but otherwise didn't contest it. they gave the rest to jessica. they made up a fake story to her that they made a 2nd place prize on the spot and jessica won it, thanks to the generosity of my wife and i. this was all bogus.

we made a post on our community facebook page saying we had a great time at the competition but didn't appreciate the comments we received or how we were treated. i guess jessica's family got wind of this and contacted my wife to meet up earlier today.

jessica's family gave us the money back and while they were excited at first, couldn't take it under false pretenses. they found it condescending to give jessica a prize just for having asd. it was a joint decision between jessica and her parents.

we talked a bit and learned jessica only joined because she's writing a cookbook for an asperger's syndrome organization. she's apparently an avid cook and has trouble keeping everything consistent every time, so it's half for her and half for this organization. part of why she went to the competition is to raise awareness of the cookbook itself as well as asd/ass and hopefully win, of course. we didn't know any of this at all, and i guess this is why the organizers wanted good pr.

my wife asked her if there was anything she could do and she can. she's going to help out where she can or if jessica needs assistance. things like editing, photography, etc. i guess everything turned out okay for everyone in the end, except my contempt for the competition organizers.

pps: yes, i know ""mentally handicapped"" isn't the right verbiage. i've learned a lot about asd in the last few days. i only kept it to be congruent with the previous post. autism and asperger's in particular may not always or ever be a mental handicap, i should have said disabled instead judging by a few comments.",3

i came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. i see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead i just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. after this during the middle of the night i took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. it took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. queue bitching. queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". i don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. i'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when i regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think i'm an ass for good now and i had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

i have no regrets, and i don't think i'm an ass, but given i lurk this sub a lot i'm curious for your verdict in this matter. aita?",3
"by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.. i'm in my third year of university taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. to start the semester i ended up missing the first week of school because i was on a last minute trip with my friends. it was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since i technically couldn't afford to go.

anyway, i came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. on both those days i have classes all day until 2pm so i usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. so my first tuesday home i ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. so as part of my degree i have to take microeconomics which all i knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. when i get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so i just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

this goes on for 3.5 weeks. i came to class. took notes. then did the weekly assignments. on the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is febuary 1st. so the class before the exam, january 30th, i decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. now i was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was all theory based while the class was heavy math based. i understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. i explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*explains above about material*
prof: ""what do you mean theory? all the assignments are filled with math. are you using launchpad?""
me: ""no the assignments are online. like the website we bought the textbook from. whats lauchpad?""
prof: ""pardon? i don't have a textbook for this course.""
me: ""it literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*shows syllabus*
prof: ""wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
me: ""what do you mean...? this is econ 202 right?""
*prof starts laughing*
prof: ""haha this is econ 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. this is a new one, i've never experienced this before.""
me: ""well this is awkward. i better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

i then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. i caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. even showed him my econ 301 notes to prove i couldn't make this shit up. he just laughed and said the same thing ""this is a new one for me."" turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. same with the midterms. they were relevant because it was obviously a level above what i was supposed to be doing and the only thing i got wrong was the building code. they were both classroom 112, just different buildings. so basically i just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. wish me luck tomorrow!

tldr; i was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until i finally realized. then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. crazy coicidences all around.

edit: well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""you made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". the exam is in a couple hours and i will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but i had fun and went to tiesto's birthday in vegas amongst other kool stuff. life goes on.

2. i was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and i had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). so i do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. he did everything on the board and there were online notes but i figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. i highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. it's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. i've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so i'm sure it will turn out fine. it'll be a funny story at grad when i get my ring.

thanks for all the support too. :) making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

edit 2: just got back from the exam.. i didn't crush it but there is no way i didn't pass. it was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. the prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""i usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm i will take the average to make up that first exam."" so all in all i survived and live to fight another day.

just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. i will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. in the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. but somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - cz

"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house?. so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"by eating a free gumball..  

i'm 23 years old, and i admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

earlier today i was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. during that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, i thought i would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

i checked four candy dispensers; all empty. one last chance. i opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, i find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. without any thought or inspection, i excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. at the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

so there i am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as i spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. i'm certain i looked ridiculous, and i'm still brushing my teeth.

"for telling my wife that if she quits her job i expect her to cover all the housework?. my wife wants to quit her job. she wants to be a sahm to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


in order for her to do that, i would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on saturdays. i told her that i if she quits her job then i expect her to cover all the housework. i may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. i will will help out on weekends but during weekdays i rather rest. 


my wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and i am being lazy and discriminative against women. i don't really mean that, as i think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. i will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. aita?


edit: i admit that i did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because i was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. ofcourse, i also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",3
"for telling my mother-in-law that she can't control how i act in my home?. my mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. it's been ok. she and i are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. she is a traditional hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. i am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

before, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" i used to watch what i said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. but when my spouse asked if she could live with us, i said i was okay with it as long as i no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. my spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. i don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

last week, my 10-year-old and i were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. we were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. we are very mature, i know. but when i said, ""i fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in spanish, ""don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. i will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" and i said, in english (i can understand spanish but can't speak it well), ""this is my home. you don't get a say in how i interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" she stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

my spouse says ita because i embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because i expected her to accept too much, too quickly. they also say that i am being a little culturally insensitive and that i need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how i spoke to her, so i need to apologize. but i think it was important for her to see that i will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that i won't be policed in my own home.",3

"schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing.. you have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. so many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. i had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and i had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until i cried so i was forced to give up, not to mention that was a huge expense every month some families might not be able to spare. different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. turns out i didn't even have acne. i have a very common condition called kp, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. if you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. i could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. these kids essentially have an addiction. the majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine bmi and extremely healthy. not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

i knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

all in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. i'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? it is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? we often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

"once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam.. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... 

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note.  people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  words cannot do justice to the experience.  the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday.  all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note.  from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted!  the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  soon the entire monastery was aflame.  by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

"by wearing my late grandfather's shoes to a job interview. this happened january, 2018.

i was desperate to find a new job and was basically applying for anything that was asking for at least a bachelor's degree. to provide some background, i graduated with a sciences degree and there was a job posting for a junior risk management position at an accounting firm that allowed folks with a stem major to apply. and so i did even though i barely knew anything about the field of accounting or risk management. but hey, might as well.

surprisingly, they invited me to do a ""1-on-0"" interview where you basically stare at your computer webcam and answer questions that the company has prepared for you ahead of time while recording your answer... it's a pretty awful experience. however, they were all soft-skill questions so i could answer them pretty decently. after that, i surprisingly got an invitation to have an interview in-person at their office. i was very excited.

now for the fuckup: my family has an assortment of dress shoes that i could wear for the interview and i ended up grabbing a pair that belonged to my late grandpa. they were lookin fresh. i put em on and my parents dropped me off in front of the building.

i entered the building and entered the conference room where the other 5 candidates were alongside some company reps. i was cool as a cucumber and just sat in my seat until everyone arrived. right as everyone got up to enter the ""group case"" room, i looked down at my feet and noticed there were these black things scattered all around my shoes. i quickly deducted that they were shoe crumbs.

it turns out that the shoes i wore were so old and no one had worn them since... a long ass time ago. they were so old that the polymer in the soles were extremely brittle and my shoes were deteriorating in front of my eyes solely due to pressure and friction.

at that moment, i was just thinking ""oh god oh man"" but didn't want to let anyone know about it so after i got up, i pushed in my chair to hide the shoe crumbs. unluckily for me, everywhere i walked more traces of my shoes came off, leaving a trailing of black shit behind me. it was a nightmare. thankfully the carpet was greyish color so it wasn't too prominent with my black shoe crumbs but it was only a matter of time before people were going to notice. we walked to a different conference room nearby where we did a group case. it didn't go too well and i left another big mess in there but oh well.

afterwards, we were going to do the in-person interviews with the company directors and partners and divided us into two groups where three of us would go the interview first and the other three would do it after. i was a part of the latter team so we had time to kill. one of the company reps wanted to show us around the two floors and in my mind i was screaming. i wanted to minimize walking to prevent my shoes from breaking off even more.

i ended up leaving a trail of crumbs all throughout both floors and then we decided to grab some starbucks on the main floor. when i went to go grab a straw for my iced coffee, a giant block from my right shoe came off. holy shit. i kicked it into the little condiments corner and hoped no one saw. we sat down at a table until our turn for interview was approaching. on the way back to the office floor, a second massive chunk came off, this time from my left shoe. however, this time i was in the middle of the cafeteria and couldn't go back to grab it or something. so i just continued walking and just left this black shoe turd in the middle of an open space. at this point, so much of my shoes have fallen off that i was starting to walk weirdly, as my shoes has gotten so much fucked at this point.

we got back to the conference room and the moment i entered the room, i noticed two other people hovering around where i was sitting originally and said ""what's all this black stuff?"" looking at debris i had left earlier. i pretended to not hear them and sat at a different chair, attempting to engage in conversation with someone else. at this point, i was 99% sure everyone knew it was me. however, i continued to play innocent and not acknowledge the amount of debris i was leaving behind everywhere.

finally, it was my turn to do the interview and i walked to yet another office to do it, and of course that meant leaving more shoe crumbs along the way and in the boss's office. he told me he was gonna take a quick bathroom break after we entered and will be right back. i was so glad he did that as i frantically picked up the crumbs that i had already laid waste upon his office and quickly stuffed as much as i could in my pockets while he was gone. as i was doing this, all i could think was ""how did it come to this..."". the interview itself went pretty well though.

after everyone was done, the reps ended up buying lunch for us at a nearby restaurant. all i can say is rip to the cleaning staff over there. by the time i got home, you could almost look through my shoe, top-down.

needless to say, i did not get the job.

tl;dr: wore old af shoes to an interview, the soles began to deteriorate as i walked around and shuffled them, leaving an absolute disaster of a mess all around their offices as i continued to not acknowledge that i was the culprit even though i'm very certain everyone knew it was me.",4

"for having professional hair and makeup for a wedding when the bride didn't. hi, y'all.

my brother (m40) and his wife (f35) got married on sunday. i (f22) am pretty close with my brother, but not his wife, so while i was a guest, i wasn't in the bridal party. 

they got married at a somewhat local mansion, which is actually pretty affordable for a wedding venue. the dress code on the invitation was ""formal."" for the three weddings i've been to with formal dress codes (and the eight i've been to semi-formal dress codes), the implication was always that it meant professional hair and makeup. that is how *my* whole family took the dress code, so we all coordinated appointments. a few of us actually went together and had a makeup artist from a few towns over come in, so my sil could hire locally. 

well, when we got there,  her family looked good, but their hair and makeup were clearly not professionally done. when her bridesmaids came out, it was apparent they hadn't used a professional either, nor had she. 

it was kind of awkward in pictures, but i didn't really see a big deal.

well, yesterday, i got a barrage of messages from the bridal party, her mother, and the bride herself about my family trying to ""upstage her"" and that sort of thing. quite a few other relatives got the messages too, including my grandmomma. (fyi, my brother thought i looked pretty and didn't see an issue except ""when did you become a woman?"")

i've tried explaining that it was a miscommunication, but they're having none of it. was i really a bitch?

i'll post the update first, since there has been some change since i last posted. then i'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of pms i received.

yesterday, i received a call from my gf. she was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. i told her that i still care for her, and that i'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

she told me that a few days after i told her we were done, she called up her mother to talk about this. apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that i was actually manipulating her to do so. her mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

after i left her, my gf called her mum up to talk about what went on. my gf said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. my gf said she broke down on the phone, and her mother kept asking her what she will do. the conversation then ended when my gf said she didn't know.

then she started texting. after a few hours of thinking, my gf sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. she was then blocked.

my gf then called me, and told me everything.

she will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

i discussed this with my gf, and we both completely agreed that i had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that i put my foot down, because had i not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (her words, not mine)

she further went on to say that i am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a mum, if she had me, she could get through this. i broke down at this point.

i love her so much. in truth, i probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though i knew i'd resent it. i made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if i had made the right decision.

i'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

also, screw any mother who places religion over their own child. friggin lunatics.


now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: no. my gf did not cheat on me. i am almost certain about this. not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. moreover, her roommate took photos of my gf after she came home assaulted. it's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: i don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my gfs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: my gf was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the mum).

4: thanks for all the people telling me i did the right thing. it was really difficult. i'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: to the people who pm'd me telling me i'm a monstrous baby killer - i fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

taking pictures of you giving something to a homeless person is disgusting.. taking pictures and or posting about how you helped out a homless person is incredibly narcasistic and disgusting. people who do this are only feeding their ego and using this act of kindness to make themself feel better. i cant stand people who have to make a big deal that they gave a homeless person 5 bucks. these type of people also have some long cleache post about how they made a nee friend like they arnt going to go back to ignoring the homeless person on their way to work everyday from then on out. if you feel the need to brag how you helped someone out youre human garbage. ,6

"for getting upset that my sister's fiance pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?. the title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

i'm 24 and i'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

i used and used until i was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

she's my best friend and i know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

she also met her fiance two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. he's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much i put my sister through. 

despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because i am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

when i get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

when i walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure i ""didn't bring anything in"".  i instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't i, and i tell him not to touch me. 

he tells me to ""calm down"" and that if i want to be here then he needs to do this. i tell him he's being ridiculous and i try to push past him. he stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" i told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

at this point i'm getting more and more angry and i'm practically yelling in his face at this point. bystanders came between us and separated us and told my bil to just ""drop it."" he said he would but that ""they can deal with it when i get out of hand.""

i just went to go find a seat after that. 

after the reception, a lot of my family told me that i should've let him just do it and that i was acting like a huge asshole and like i had ""something to hide."" 

i don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and i don't think my reaction was over the top. if anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. my sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"my ex proposed. i said no. he is now talking about suing me. advice?. just want to say this is going to sound insane but i am not trolling/making it up.

me and this guy were together for 3 years. we're 19 now. we never talked about the future until a year in. before then i'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

in short, i wanted kids, he didn't. i wanted to stay in ireland, he didn't. i wanted to get married, he didn't. when i realised it was a bad match i broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. this happened a few times over the next 18 months in this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

we knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something i would want further down the line, i wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. if i were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then i might have an issue, but when i'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

when i went to see him this time i was again, considering breaking up with him. aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that i really don't like. so when i arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, i assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so i wouldn't cause a scene. i don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

in the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. first he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff i liked and what my taste was. i assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so i told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. i also said ""go cheap"".

the other thing he asked me was how i felt about public proposals. i told him immediately that i, personally, disliked them as i felt i wouldn't be able to say no, even if i wanted to. i feel like public proposals are ok when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not ok at all. i assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

i never thought in a million years that he would propose.

so you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

the ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. he got on one knee, and held it out to me. we were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

i said no.

well, i didn't so much say ""no"". i ran out of the restaurant.

he drove me there, so i got a cab back, and drove home that night.

i realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but i didn't know what else to do. i could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all i knew was that i didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. i felt like i couldn't even speak, i was so upset about the whole thing. so i just got up and ran.

i just want to take the opportunity to say here that i really really don't care about the rings. honestly, when i want to get married (which is absolutely not when i'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and i'd say yes. i wouldn't even need a ring. i know i'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what i'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

i didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. he said that he thought a proposal was something i'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. he said that he was out of pocket for the rings. he'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. he linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). when i asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped i would cover the cost of mine. he said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. he'd hoped that i would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but i said no. he also said i'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if i was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

we both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on sunday.

he has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that i have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which i had no part in spreading. he says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. so €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

i think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but i am not a law student or a lawyer. he is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

what do i do about all of this? do i need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

thanks in advance :)

edit:  he knew i wanted to get married but not to him. he not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. he openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and i told him that this was why i was breaking up with him the times before this that i have ended the relationship. during the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like i'm gonna propose"" (that one was last april)

"updatei (14m) have no connection with my mother(29f). my mom was raped. i don't know how to handle this.. i posted yesterday about my issue with my mom. i finally had the courage to talk to my mom about our relationship and i wasn't prepared for it.

we were alone and i just asked if she loved me. i called her mom for first time in months. i wanted to know what her feelings for me really are. i just ranted to her without letting her speak. how i needed her attention and it's affecting me. i played sports just for her attention and so that she would be proud of my achievements. i asked her why she wouldn't attend my awards ceremonies or attend parents nights at school. i would stay out late just so that she would call me. i flipped and told her she should have never had me. i fucked up.

i made my mom cry that night.

she told me that she did love me. 

she revealed that she was raped by my dad. he was her boyfriend at the time but she didn't consent. she became depressed and carried me full term. she is still recovering from her depression. my grandparents wanted her and i to be raised as siblings, in order for her to continue with her life. at first she tried to be a mother but it was really difficult raising me. this is why she has been distant from me. she doesn't know if she wants to be my mom or act as my sister. in the end she just gave up. i remind her of her rapist but she knows that i am gentle and kind. i didn't know what to say, i just hugged her. it was a hard truth to swallow. i told her that i will always be there for her. she told she didn't know i was hurting inside. i told her we can start again from scratch.

my mom joked that i scare away her boyfriends and she loves my cooking. i cried as i went to sleep. i can't blame her anymore and i should make a better effort to be more involved with her. i want to support her. i'm not going to break off contact with her. i going to try and persuade her to join me in getting some family therapy. 

i'll try my best to be a good son. thanks for the advice.

i wanted to ask if there was any advice on helping family members overcome depression.

edit: thank you for all the support. i will get my grandparents involved to search for a good therapist for my mom and myself.

actual things he has said to me

1. (a day after i gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - *disgusted tone and expression* ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" by the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

 ""who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

""why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? you keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. so maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

and so on. on average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. i've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. it's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",8

i decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. it was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

i needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

this is when things begin to go wrong.

all of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. i glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (he has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


sure enough, he began to violently seize. i go full protective mode and try to help him. he was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

we're both still naked and i have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode.

"for ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?. i've worked at my office for 8 years. i'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. i'm not his supervisor, but i'm definitely a senior employee. i'll call the guy ted faro, because he's a dick.

​

supervisor was going around introducing ted to people, and when he got to me said ""this is john"" and described my job.

​

ted: ""hi, jack.""

me: ""it's john.""

​
ted: ""what?""
​

me: ""my name's john, not jack.""

ted: ""it's close enough for me.""

supervisor: ""his name's john, not jack. let's move on.""

​

this continued for a few months. despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when i wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name jack. i finally told him ""you either use my name, or i ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

his response was ""sure thing, jackie boy.""

​

since i don't work directly with him, i figured ""screw it"" and that i'd ignore him.

​

recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. i work late some nights, and ted came to me and says ""hey, jack, i'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when i get back. see you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

as promised, i ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and i get a call. i recognize his number, so i ignored it. he called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

the first one was along the lines of ""jack i'm at enterprise. come pick me up.""

e-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as jack, jack-o, jackie, and jackie-boy. the emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

i signed out and went home. it was raining hard.

next morning, i saw that ted had sent a few more e-mails. i printed them off. at 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""where the f-bomb were you? i told you when to pick me up! i had to take a cab! do you know how much that cost me?!"" he goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

supervisor: ""ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. he was caught out in the rain.""

​

i relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. i'd highlighted the threats.

supervisor: ""i can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. but it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. that's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""with the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

a few people at the office have commented that i'm the jerk for ignoring ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

"my(25m) girlfriend(22f) wants to share our incomes, thing is, i make roughly 7 times as much, advice please. so here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. my girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, i finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company i did my internship at and within a year i got a promotion and a large payraise and i am now making roughly 150k a year, while she makes 20k a year.

now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place i bought so i pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, phone bill, netflix and so forth.

now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently i pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

now she seems to be jealous i got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs i put the majority in my savings account.

in my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

so what do i do, i hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if i am honest i am questioning my relationship as there is no way i am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

edit: so, there are so many comments i am having a hard time keeping up with it. if i don't respond, know that i am trying to at least read your comment. but currently when i read and respond to 1 comment i get 10 more! haha. i just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... even those who yell about mgow or something and those who are if the opinion i need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in! i had not expected my post to blow up like this though hahaha.",8
"by letting my boyfriend have a lie in.. obligatory just over a week ago comment. so i have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we've only been together three months. and also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. 

ragebeak belongs to me. it is a saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. still, i thought being a saturday i'd take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.

i fell down the stairs. still holding very small parrot and my first thought was oh god dont crush him so i threw my hands up like i just didn't care and...

i broke my back.

and then when i finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) i passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. 

woke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like the dead and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.

tl;dr removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. right in his face.

edit - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so i'm not paralyzed and there shouldn't be any life-ruining effects. i'm just on bed rest and lots of pain medication!

thanks for the silver! and gold! and the poo! and all your lovely comments/well wishes/ recommendations :)

"my f28 mil won't take my kid's 4 anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously. **update at bottom of post.**

i'll try to keep this as short as possible. sorry for mobile formatting. i've never really seen eye-to-eye with my mil because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... i understand that children need discipline, but i prefer a gentler approach with my son. i've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists i let it go, so i've tried to. 

until now. my son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. she insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that i'm just babying him. i've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

she has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. i told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying i accused her of being an unfit grandmother. which i admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

now my husband wants me to apologise to her. he says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that i'm overreacting. i kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is of the essence because it happens so quickly. 

so, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

she's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a lot of peanuts, everywhere. i asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

i'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a mama's boy who thinks mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. he says he turned out just fine being raised by her and i worry too much. 

would it be awful if i insist she only see him if i'm present? am i completely unreasonable and overreacting? is there anything else i can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**edit/mini-update**: first of all, woah. i did not expect this to get so much attention. thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. in case you missed it: i've left for now, removed my son from the situation, and i'm now currently staying at my brother's house. at least for a few days until things cool off and i'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. in the mean time, i've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. my husband has been to the same appointments i have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

some people have accused me of being a helicopter mom, or trying to demonize my mil. and given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe i'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then i'm okay. i'm not even a sahm, we have an incredible nanny while i work ft, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. in the past, i've tried my best for my mil to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, i've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. but i'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

lastly, i just want to say my mil has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. she won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. so, i don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. she's very strong in her beliefs. i did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. my husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so i told him to find time or he won't be getting any time with my son until he does. if he's going to be so careless, i'll end up dealing with this legally. 

thanks again everyone. words can't express my gratitude. i will update with a new thread eventually.",8
"my (16m ) gf (17f) is 8 months pregnant with my daughter. is my life actually over?. ok so i'm trying to make the best of a not so good situation. my gf who i've known for basically forever (been official since i was 14) is having my baby. everyone especially my parents keep telling me i fucked up big and my life is over. they say i'm a loser and i'll never get anywhere in life. they say i'll never be happy again. how true is that?

i keep telling myself there's gotta be good things about babies otherwise people wouldn't keep having them since lots have them in purpose. 

i'm pretty much freaking out at this point. i have a fuck ton of mixed feelings about the whole thing. obviously i don't want to be a dad but im gonna be. so it is what it is. 

my parents are being difficult and not making things easier, in fact making it worse. since i told them she was pregnant they said since i'm making adult decisions i now have adult responsibilities. they make me pay rent, part of hydro/cable/internet/water etc. i have to buy my own food and anything i need. i have a part time job but they now take the entire paycheque and are insisting i'm in the negative each month and owe them a couple grand. i have legit not been able to buy a single baby thing cuz of them.

i desperately needed shoes but since they take all my money i had none. i was wearing little bros shoes since he's cool but they're too small. gfs parents bought me a new pair since i got an infected toenail from being squished. i don't want to owe them too, jc.

anyway. i'm leaving home once school is done in june. gf's parents said i won't have to pay them rent as long as i help with the baby and contribute with that.

my parents say they'll sue me for the money i owe them. can they? when i get mad they just say i'm an adult and i get adult consequences now.

so ya. this got a bit derailed. am i doomed?",8

"people obsessed with sports are just as nerdy as people into video games or dungeons and dragons.. title says it pretty well. don't get me wrong i'm a huge sports fan, i like teams in the ncaa, nfl, and mlb. i follow them all very closely. i am a nerd because of that. i sit alone and watch games and yell and carry on, but so many people are in denial about this.

there are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing. that should garner just as much criticism as majoring in psychology, gender studies, and sociology. those degrees are completely useless if you don't get a job like selling tickets for your local college team.

we all know someone who is that ""sports are my life guy"" 

also so many of the people that give people shit calling them losers or nerd for playing things like league of legends or d&d are these sports nerds. there's guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they'd probably give them unrelenting shit.

again nothing wrong with being a sports fan, but let's call a spade a spade. sports fanatics are nerds too, they need to embrace it.

"update mn school is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. i'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.. i'm updating my last post(https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

i did what you all told me to do. i wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. i also called them. they said they will speak with the school.

i was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. i did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

i said loudly ""i think you owe me an apology.""

she said ""yes, i should not have accused you of cheating.""

i said ""yes, and another apology for saying i don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

she said ""i'm sorry"" and left.

the principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

i said ""it wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

he apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. i then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

so things are sorted out now. but also, i'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. i only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and i was very pissed off at them. and the counselor had given me horrible advice.

"by accepting a proposition for a threesome. obligatory this didn't happen today, it happened last summer. newly obligatory this will not end in incest. i didn't accidentally eat out my cousin or half-sister or whatever dumbass erotica you're all posting lately. obligatory tl;dr at bottom.

&#x200b;

it's a perfect summer night in 2018. i'm leaving a job that i hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. i turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 am,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.

&#x200b;

last call rings out, the bar is mobbed. i lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (mag) who approaches me shortly after. she's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. she's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.

&#x200b;

mag is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the bmi chart, leading me to believe i'm being hit with a bait and switch. they swiftly disprove that theory by literally asking if i ""want both"" of them. worth noting that this is the only time i've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so i jumped at the chance.

&#x200b;

next thing i know, we're in a cab on the way back to whoever's house the birthday pregame was. there is alcohol everywhere. they're feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it's my last day on earth. some girl is crying on the couch.

&#x200b;

my drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. having been recently broken up with, i know exactly where her head is at. having done far too many shots, i am not scared to console this crying stranger. soon i will be the advice champion, and fuck every girl in the house.

&#x200b;

i launch into my speech, hitting every point she so desperately needs to hear:

* you're so much better than him.
* he *obviously* doesn't deserve you.
* you'll look back and laugh at this in a month.

&#x200b;

i'm now starting to notice that the cheers and applause i was waiting for are actually all death stares, even a few dropped jaws. as it turns out, this girl's boyfriend didn't break up with her.

no, he fucking ***died.***

final update:

i first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. i got a lot more responses than i had thought i would, so i apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

my sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on september 1st. it's been a very hard couple of days and i've been grieving, as has my family. 

we were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. i was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. she was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

i wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. she normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. we will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

my family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. she will always be in our hearts and i know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice i was given.",8
"update - my brother went missing 6 years ago. police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? how do we get more information. illinois.. https://redd.it/74we5z

i talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. they found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. the officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

there days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed dna samples to confirm. dna confirmed it was him.

what happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). that was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. that's when they decided to... his friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

the officer says my brother didn't die in pain. it was multiple gunshots. you'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. we had a funeral for him. now there's a place that i can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

i thank all of you who helped.

"when my best mate changed his name in my phone to ""sexy jess from work"". so several years ago my best mate todd changed his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" and then would ring my phone in the middle of the niggt to try and get me in trouble with my partner. but she was friends with him before we had even gotten together so she recognized his number and his prank didnt really  work out.

fast forward 6 or 7 years to the weekend just passed.
im sitting on the couch watching tv and my partner is upstairs my 8 year old daughter is bored so i give her my phone to play a game on.

que fuck up.
i never changed todds name back. its been a running joke between us for years.
so ""sexy jess from work"" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. she freaks out. comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams ""i hate you dad!"". she runs off upstairs.
so im sitting there really confused. after a few seconds i follow her upstairs. i can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.
now im really confused. i get to the bedroom. my partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from ""sexy jess from work"". i piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.

tldr : buddy saved his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" several years ago as a joke. today my daughter sees it freaks out and thinks im cheating on hwr mother.

"people aren't homophobic. you're just weird.. i'm a gay guy. i've got a beard, a build, and i dress like most humans do. i don't lisp when i talk, and i don't spend my time gossiping about other people in a weird jersey girl accent (which would sound annoying enough on a woman). i don't dress in drag and attempt to stick my anus in the faces of bewildered pedestrians at exhibitionistic pride parades. people know i'm gay, and you know how much homophobia i've experienced in my life? zero. not even from ultra conservative people.

i talk about my sex life like heterosexual people do, and my friends support it. no one bats an eye. i don't try to fuck my straight friends, first of all because they are my friends, and secondly because they are straight. no one feels weirded out in my presence.

much of what we call homophobia today isn't an inordinate fear of gay people. it's not even really a fear. more of a mild to aggressive weirded outness at guys who use their homosexuality as a staging ground for obtusely bizarre, exaggerated feminine behavior (girls mostly do not act like this version of feminine either lol).

it's ok to be weird. it's ok to be offensive. it's ok to act like a girl if you are a guy. just don't be surprised if the majority of the population finds you odd. because you are odd. and your oddities have dick all to do with the fact that you like dick, and no one is responding inappropriately because you like dick.

i could barely eat and she could tell something was up. she got worried thinking i was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

i sat her down and told her everything how i realized i was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. i told her that i never said anything because i did not want to jeopardize our friendship. her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

i honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and i honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. she half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

we hugged and i told her that there is no one on this earth i would want to have a child with but her. we talked for hours ,in fact i just got home. we have decided that we want to focus on us for now. i want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

i know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end.

she chose differently. first, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. then she went back in. at this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. she knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

both of us have lost parents. i lost my dad 3 years ago. he was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before i actually met her. i have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom i have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. she lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

i don't even know how to begin to say thank you. i'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and i can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. i don't know how to repay her. or where to begin. can anybody think of a nice gesture i can make it up to her? she must be devastated. i can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

tl;dr: my fiancee had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. how do i repay her?",8
"i (27f) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work. hello,

as the post says i am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **virginia**. i work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. when i was hired i wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. i think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that i'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. i have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. so then i had to buy a wireless mouse. i have a nice computer and i hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

&#x200b;

today i have strep. strep as an adult is terrible. i told my boss i could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. that night on the phone she said yes please work from home. first thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. it is a google chrome timer extension. i told them that i would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but i was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. she said ok, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since i wouldn't install the timer and that i was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

&#x200b;

this is on top of the fact that i have to clock in/ clock out on an app on my phone that tracks my gps. yes, i have a master's degree and have to clock in/out even for lunch. during the entire time it is on, gps is tracked.

so listen, i know i need a new job but- is this legal? how do i approach this? i am now going to have to use sick/vacation time that i wasn't planning on using. i think i should be paid for my time today.

"because i refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? i low key hate her.. i'm 15 years old. i have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. i'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. she also doesn't understand stuff. that's probably the easiest way to put it. she's just a human body with nothing inside. 

she's my stepmoms daughter. my stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. i don't know my stepmom very well and i don't really get on with her. we are respectful to each other but i'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. i am always on my own and i used to hate it but i'm used to it now.

ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. that's fine, i get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that i don't want to do and i resent doing. stuff like staying home when i want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that i don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

my own mom passed away when i was small so i can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all i'm just a lot more angry than i used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever i say i don't want to do anything for her. even stuff like feeding her- like- i don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. i didn't ask for this. 

anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. she was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. i don't want to go and visit her. i remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and i just hate hospitals and i sort of hate my stepsister and i just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know i'm there. 

my stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. they haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because i don't want to visit. my grandma who lives in canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and i don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so i'm assuming my dad has told her i'm refusing to go. he keeps pleading with me but i keep telling him i'm not doing it. i told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and i need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.

"for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?. for the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. i'll call her princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. she is a medical researcher (studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. i was apprehensive because i know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

we have a 4 bedroom house. me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler freddie. i told sister that princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed ok with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. princess even said it would be ok to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. it's getting a lot colder now and i'd never let freddie sleep outside. 

i told princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

in all honesty i was right in thinking having princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. she goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

she's also rude to my kids. my daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but princess was lovely enough to say that if her bf had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and i had a word with princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. i made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. i also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that i wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. sorry but how can i be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

edit: a lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. i won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. firstly to the people who have claimed i was acting snobby about princess's job. that wasn't the case. i wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that i could say she's ''only a researcher''. on the contrary, i specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. she earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. she just wanted more money to herself. 

also, the people who claim that i was being nasty to her because i didn't like her and things like that. i don't dislike her at all. i was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, i've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. i was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. she has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because princess constantly bullied her. 

regarding the dog's room. there isn't any furniture in freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

and for those who think i was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. we tried our best to make her feel welcome. gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. we gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, i went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. within her first week here, princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

regarding the weed and clubbing thing: i've nothing against weed use. i smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and i'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. if she was doing it away from the house i would not care at all. i wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. i'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. however, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

last but not least, i didn't call her ''princess'' on here offensively. i wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",3

i don't know why she seems to have aged early or why i look younger - i was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. i used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).

i moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. last weekend i went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and i was shocked by her appearance.

i knew she used botox, but this was next level. her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. i asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and ""quite a bit of filler"". i'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.

she asked me not to tell anyone and i said of course i wouldn't. but then...

now, i thought she looked weird because i know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.

i was absolutely fine with that until she said:

""it's probably because i didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""

as a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, i was hurt by that. without thinking i blurted out (louder than i'd intended): ""oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".

i regretted it before i'd even finished saying it, but i thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.

my mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. my brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. pretty much everyone else thinks i am a massive asshole.

"dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. how do i protect myself legally?. i have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. a few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

the last few months have been hell. they have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. they are loud way past our community quiet hours. they have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). i have recorded it. it wakes up my 2 year old. do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

they leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. it has ruined my outdoor rug. i took pictures. 

they drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

they regularly park in the reserved spot i pay for monthly. it is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. they are an extra $50 a month. the minute i leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until i threaten to involve the apt. manager.

they have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

they like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. i have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. it ruined my potted plants outside. 

i have reported all the incidents. i have tried to ask them to cut it out. they don't care. 

i recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out i am not the first to complain that day. the police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (i am not sure of how it was found. i stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

since then they have taken to recording me any time i leave my apartment. they have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

the woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how i am impeding her ability to exist in public because i am racist. she says i call the police on her for doing nothing. i only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

i understand i am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. i would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

i just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot i pay for monthly, and play loud music i can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

she had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

they have really upped the bleach game too. it has gotten on a few spots on my door and i am scared they might throw it at my car. 

i have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. i can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

i can't lose my job and i am not sure how protect myself legally. 

they are actually my paid space right now but i am scared to have them towed because i don't know what they are going to do. i pay for that space. i have proof. the sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

if i tell the apartment they will have the car towed but i'll look like a racist. 

all it takes is one video and a lie and i am ruined. 

i want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but i think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that i pay for is reasonable. but maybe not?",2

"it's fine to not like kids, but constantly talking about how much you hate them is just you being an asshole.. seriously. like i get it, kids can be gross and annoying and stressful. it's fine to not like them, it's fine to not want to be around them, and it's certainly fine to not want to have them.

what some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. even if you're not saying it to their face, even if they're too young to even understand you — you're just an asshole. 

also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. they have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. they are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. and just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

"for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor?. title is pretty self explanatory. but basically over the weekend, i had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. she's babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. she gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. things happen and somehow it got knocked over.

her laptop no longer switches on. she's blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. i told her no as it shouldn't have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. she's refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she'll never babysit for me ever again. i really don't feel as though it's my responsibility.. aita?

edit: yikes this blew up. a few people have asked for more info. yes, i packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. i supplied everything he'd need for the weekend - including nappies and food. my parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she'd be able to spend time with him. it wasn't just 'babysitting' but more enjoying time with her nephew. i gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as 'payment' for watching my son. every other time she'd had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",3

"by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.. well, fuck. 

not a throwaway because i have no shame left to feel. 

by orgasming so many times i went blind in one eye. that's right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

seriously, though. last night i was trying to sleep (obligatory ""not technically today"") but failing miserably. i have bipolar disorder, i'm off my medication (that is a in itself), and i was in the early stages of a manic episode. for those who aren't batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. i tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my mothman musical, and thinking about al gore. at about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, i decided i had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

enter stage left lesbian porn. here's the part where i mention how my clit is made of steel. i came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. for some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. having finished the porn (which i actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) i decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. now, whenever i'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, i always have to go completely under the covers. unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where i live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? anyway, for some reason i can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. maybe saudi arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? since this incident i've only slept for four hours. i'm losing my mind. 

anyway, at this point i'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. after ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. my clit breathes a sigh of relief and i emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. my right eye is stinging a little bit, and i realise the acne treatment i'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. i grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

i'm sure you can see where this is going, but i certainly didn't. and now i could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. i wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. the weird angle i'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. for some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. i felt genuinely betrayed. like, how dare you? you did this to me. this is your fault. et tu, clite? 

once my eye starts to swell up, i call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. arguably the weirdest walk of shame i've ever done. 

i continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. the swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. my eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

now i've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that i'll probably have to cancel. i've been wanting to bang this guy for weeks. also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and i can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish i'm shit out of luck. 

tl;dr: i masturbated and now i'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

edit: sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? this blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if i wrote it. damn my unforgettable mothman musical. anyway, i did not cancel my dick appointment. i told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (less endearing when i got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. i've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. hallelujah.

i was driving her home one day and said (this is abridged) ""hey i know you're going through a lot of bodily changes right now and you're really growing up. i think it might be time to start wearing deodorant.""

she said ""i smell?"" and i said ""yah, just a little. no big deal. just pick up some deodorant, your mom has some.""

"ca i want to divorce my wife of 6 years, who has been a jehovah's witness for the last 4 years because of the extreme teachings of the cult, and how it could affect our children (3,1).. so i started looking deeper into all of this amidst my wife and i's simultaneous suspicions that her mentors within her church were ""poisoning us.""  they would bring us food all the time over a couple month period, and we were constantly sick.  since cutting those people out we have been better.  i want to the hospital to have us all screened, but they referred us to a social worker, who is talking with police on the matter.   

this is when i started looking deeper into this ""religion.""  long story short, i want as far away as i can from this stuff as well as my children.  i'm a military veteran who is 29, and has supported my family entirely up until now.  i have only been out of the military for a a little over a year now, and have bad anxiety and ptsd issues that have made attaining a job hard, so i'm living off my gi bill through the military (monthly check to supplement education post military -36 months), and military disability.  my spouse is hesitant to work, because the people in her religion tell her a wife should be at home.  

i thought i was being a supportive husband by supporting her choice of religion, but now that i've learned more, i can't.  i've tried to talk calmly about this to her many times, but it goes nowhere.  the religion is designed to warn her about people like me, ""worldly"" people.   she goes on talking about ""the end"" all the time like she is anticipating it.  i hate to say it, but i fear the brainwashing has potentially dulled her sense of reality.   even after knowing these people could have poisoned her own children, she defends the organization as a whole.  she doesn't want to go to any conventional counseling because ""other people don't need to know our problems.""  i have no idea what do to at this point.

i probably will be supporting our family by my previously mention means while i try to get mentally stable again to work full time over the next couple of years.  i only have about $15,000 in savings, and i own our only vehicle, a fully paid off car.  we have furniture and stuff but i'm not attached to any of it.  i have a life insurance policy that was converted from my military sgli to a vgli and that's it for assets.   other than that, no big debts or anything.   

over the last 4 years, this is kind of how the split has been raising the kids:

2016,17:  i was in the military, my wife would handle the morning routine with the kids because i left early in the morning and got home in the afternoon, and would play with the kids and help with everything like cleaning, brushing teeth, putting to bed etc.  the only thing i didn't do much was cook, which i only did maybe once a week.  



2018,2019 (post military):  i spent 2018 looking for and working several different jobs that didn't last long, mostly in part to stress and adjustment disorder, and as a result only worked about 5 months last year, which ate into savings. besides that, we have done everything in terms of taking care and spending time with the kids kids equal.

as i right this, i hide my children's easter eggs alone in the backyard, as my wife will stay in the bedroom today because of the ""holiday"" she is not allowed to celebrate.   the psychological effect of never having their mom around for birthdays and holidays is only going to get worse, and it's hard on me to have to see them do it alone. what kind of parent doesn't want to have fun with their children smh.   

what is a divorce going to look like with her? i really just don't want to give up my disability pay for life or my gi bill payments for school.  furniture, car, belongings can be split idgaf.  i don't want to pay her long term.

"update i take prescription medication for adhd. started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. left old job for new one and now i'm unemployed.. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

i am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

i met with an attorney for a consultation thursday. after talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has adhd. i could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. she told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as i could get punitive damages. i told her i don't want to sue anyone if i don't have to, i just want this job offer back as i have been waiting a long time for a job like this. she also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, i could file an eeoc charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. due to an unrelated incident a while back, i have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my google drive. i played the calls with my manager to the attorney. when my manager informed me of the preliminary result i explained to her my prescription medication and my adhd. the attorney told me it was good that i disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and adhd would not cause any issues in performing my duties). i was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. the call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but i would be paid for my one day of work. as far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if i knew i would fail. i had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

i asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because i signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. she would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. she said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. she said ultimately the point of having a lab test and mro is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the mro is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. if it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of hr and their legal department. when she initially talked to the head of hr, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. he called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. my attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if i could come into her office that afternoon. i agreed.

when i was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of hr, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. essentially this call was an apology to me. the head of hr profusely apologized for this. he went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in hr and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. if he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. he went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of hr felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. they want me to come back in monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. he stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" he even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch monday.

he told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my adhd. i told them that wasn't necessary as i am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

so now i have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of hr. i owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. i wish i could personally shake hands with all of you. i was so scared before reading your comments. thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

edit: i'm going to disclose my medication. i take vyvanse. a lot of people assume i'm taking adderall. i used to take adderall but my doctor suggested i try vyvanse when it came out. although similar and made by the same company, vyvanse is a much better medication for me. the release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as adderall, my appetite is not affected, i sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that adderall does when wearing off.

"manitoba, canada (update) my cousin's landlord enacted a new rule that states ""lights out by 10pm"" - and is enforced by the landlord using the breakers to shut off all power, despite my cousin paying for his own electricity.. previous post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

my cousin and i want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. he couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. thank you so much! this situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

now for the update: my cousin is moving out this weekend. he spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. the landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. my cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. after an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. the landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for june, july, and august, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. my cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. he is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with james ever again.

while my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. he was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. my cousin and i honestly feel bad for james as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

and that is it. thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. take care, you beautiful people.

edit: since i'm getting nasty messages, i figured i should edit this to let everyone know that i have finally convinced my cousin to report him. he will be reporting the moment he has moved out - which is saturday. we are also looking to get him help for his declining mental health. also, my cousin already received every dime owed to him, in cash, and he received a revised contract stating that the lease was voided as of june 1st, and that no further payments will be required.

there you go folks. please stop insulting my cousin and i.",2

"update: landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. good news!. well, here's my update! and with good news!

so first of all, i just wanted to say: wow. the amount of support i received, both in replies and in pms, was absolutely amazing. everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. the person who said ""sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

that said - i feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). he's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. he grew up in rural (arkansas, i think? that or alabama) and came to ma later in life. this was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. that, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

i know some of you were hoping i'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, i decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

yesterday i sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. he realized very quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. he also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. he just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

we ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if i weren't having the conversation with him i'd think he were a caricature). he's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so i think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". he seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. i reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

he still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. he seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. he agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which i will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

the past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. if things go well, i might even potentially renew the lease come september. i'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but i think i'll leave the issue where it lies for now. if this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, i'll go at him with everything i can in the future - but for now i'm satisfied. i'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",2

"update from the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on christmas. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  my girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

i posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. it got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and i was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and i fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the big talk.

little did i know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. i didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. so thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, i got a dreaded ""we need to talk"" text. yep, all caps. and i was like ""welp, i'm dead.""

she was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). still, she said i had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and i agreed/apologized. she knows i'm writing this update and she's going to read it before i post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

we talked for a long time thursday night. she said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. it's partially a cultural thing, according to her. gf was born and raised in the u.s. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. she said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. she grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

on top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. she said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. she also got very little affection from her parents growing up. it seems like that was all replaced with material things. so, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

all that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. she was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. she was really hurt that i said i thought i was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and i said i was sorry, and i am. i was still raging a little when i wrote that. i asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. it wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

we've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. i'm totally fine this. we've been together for almost 3 years and i think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. she's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. we spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. it's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. i'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. no one can change their habits overnight.

we're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. the plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. she also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. it's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. we're going to give it until my lease is up in march (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. she isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before march.

tl:dr: thanks, reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. i did and i think things are going to get better.

edit

to everyone who's wondering, her parents are from mexico.

gf has a job and her own income. she is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. you're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. in that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. that's now just out there for the whole world to read. you can't say that wouldn't be alarming. she said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. all things considered, i think she was pretty reasonable about it. ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure i thanked reddit for the perspective. no, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. she's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",8
"boyfriend (21m) kisses me when i'm asleep lol should i tell him i know?. so i've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and i found this out pretty early on. he does cute stuff when he thinks i'm asleep. i'm a deep sleeper so i never woke up from it. i couldn't asleep one night and i knew he was walking past me and he blew me a kiss and just said ""love ya bitch"" while he was walking lol. i didn't know what to say because we hadn't said i love you or anything at that point so i just continued to pretend to be asleep. he actually does it all the time!! sometimes he'll give me a kiss on my cheek or arm, or he'll say ""love you babe"". he is so sweet when i'm asleep!! he's not really affectionate like that when i'm awake, he kisses me but he doesn't randomly call me cute or something. and when i'm asleep, he can say ""did you know you're so cute"" like what!!!!???? sometimes i pretend to be asleep because i like hearing it. and he'll tell his friends that he's not a pussy and he's so tough and everything and i'm like 🙄🙄 you literally come to me when i'm sleeping and tell me good night in this sweet voice. i never say anything though

so. yesterday i was in living room and she called me my twin's name. i just ignored her and pretended she wasn't there. then she called me my name and i answered her normally. my brother did the same, we did it few times. now she's mad at us, apparently we're being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes ""honest mistake"" sometimes.",3
"by forgetting my weed butter in the fridge while my parents staying in my flat. it all happened this morning.

i´m a student  in cologne, germany. my parents visited me over the weekend and stayed in my own flat. yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester. my dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed. next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep. she woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen. i couldn't eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad. so my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some wurstbrot (sausage sandwich). after a few minutes i started eating too. i took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened. i had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies. we made way to much of it so i kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge. yeah.. so i took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the wurstbrot. i was shocked and felt like frozen. i didn't know how to explain or even what to do from there on. my mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right. i asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box. so i started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on. my mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. for her its a real, hard drug.my dads reaction was pretty chill. he started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too. an hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. he started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to amsterdam. i am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! cause my mom isn't fine with it at all.as soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. she is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought i would never do drugs. my dad told me she would calm down soon. they drove home a few hours ago.i think i never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!

tldr: my mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. my dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep.

edit: so my mom called me today. she apologised that she seemed so disappointed she was only afraid of it. she told me that she never came in contact with weed even in her youth. she has absolutely no relationship to it. she said that she is proud of me and that i should be carefully with smoking weed.   
thanks for all the likes, comments and awards! didn't expect that to happen. i try to call my dad later and ask him if he is still into smoking weed.",4

edit: i did not expect this to blow up so much, thank you kind stranger for the gold!

"by not realizing cheese isn't supposed to hurt you. i guess this is three decades in the making but i only discovered it saturday, so it feels like a very fresh fu.

this weekend i was eating a sandwich with some extra sharp parmigiano-reggiano cheese flakes on it and i made the comment over voice chat with my friends that it was so good but so sharp it was tearing up my mouth. i had a momentary pause before a chorus of puzzled friends chimed in at the same time to ask me to elaborate.

""you know, it's extra sharp. it really cuts and burns my gums and the roof of my mouth.""

and that's when my friends informed me that none of them have this reaction, and futhermore, *no one* has this reaction. i hear several keyboards going at once with people having alt-tabbed to google around and our best webmd-style guess is that i have an allergic reaction to some histamines common in sharp cheeses, and that i've had this reaction for *thirty years*, and that i always assumed *everyone* had it. 

""what the hell do you mean when you call it a *sharp* cheese if that's not what you're talking about?!""

i figured the mild-sharp spectrum for cheeses was like the mild-hot spectrum for spicy foods. i love spicy foods. i love sharp cheeses. i thought they were the same kind of thing where they were supposed to hurt you a little bit. apparently ""sharp"" just means ""flavorful"" or ""tangy.""

"banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat.. in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

i used to take the bus daily to get to work. not a big deal, i'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

but every thursday was awful. every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. still, generally not an issue because i'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

but this bus company was not reliable. we have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. one day, a little school bus came instead. it had 9 seats. since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. so you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

i have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, i needed that time to sit down. so, that's what i was doing, as always.

the group gets on the bus, i've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. i look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. i take out my earbuds and she says to me that i need to give up my seat. the other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when i tell her i need it she says that i need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. i try my best to explain that medically i can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says i'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). so after a couple minutes of this i snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as i'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. she gives me a look like i just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

two days later when i tried to get on the bus i was told i was banned from the service.

when i called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. i explained the medical reasons i needed it and was simply told i have a lower priority because i'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as i ever knew. he ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as i know, but i feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

on my original post it was suggested a lot that i make a post here. i live in ontario, canada. i don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. i know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

anyway that's why i'm here for help. am i in the right to sue? for how much? i don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

edit: there's a lot of responses on here so i'm sorry if i don't get to everyone, but for now i will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the ontario human rights legal support center on monday. thanks everyone. i'll still be accepting further advice if there is more i should do though obviously i can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

"by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner. happened about a week ago, but i've been hesitant to post this as i wasn't sure if it really fits. no one involved in this story is a minor. tl;dr at bottom.

i am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. there are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. we were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iphone. she was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""what?"" the collective asked.

""there's some dude's dick here!""

we gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). we laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. we looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. we also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. we couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

before i turned the setting off, everyone using my family icloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos i saved to my phone. this got annoying after my mom started questioning things i had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so i turned it off.

without thinking of the consequences, i asked her if she shared an icloud account with anyone. she said she shared one with her parents. she got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

i've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. the rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. we sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

the image is burned into all of our minds. i've never met her father but i'm terrified one day i will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and i'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

tl;dr: friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, i can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through icloud, and now none of us are okay.

edit: clarifying the tl;dr

edit 2, electric boogaloo: why on earth is this on the front page of reddit. also thanks for the silver

edit 3, freud enters the chat: since like half of the comments are ""why would you cry from seeing your dad's dick"":

* we are all americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us
* we are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn't really how we like to think about our parents
* it wasn't crying like oh my god what will i do, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like ""i can't believe this is what just happened""

"i (29m) just spent another awkward holiday with my girlfriend's (28f) rich family. my girlfriend and i have been together almost 3 years. 99% of the time, we're great. she's funny and smart and we have a lot of shared interests. but every time we visit her family i start doubting everything. 

they are very wealthy, which by itself is not a bad thing, but they're also very fixated on being rich and have a habit of placing the monetary value of things (and people) over everything else. i come from a very middle class background. i have a good education and a decent career that i really enjoy, but i'm definitely not rich. because of this, they view me as a loser.

for example, yesterday we made the two-hour drive to her parents' in my new-ish honda. when we got there, her mom immediately ordered me to park the car behind the house so the neighbors wouldn't see it. she was furious we didn't bring gf's land rover, which they bought for her as a birthday gift this year. gf doesn't like to drive on long trips and i'm not allowed to drive the land rover (per her parents) so we brought my honda. 

gf's dad has never spoken to me directly. even when she introduced me the first time, he turned to her and said, ""what does he do?"" so we went in the house and i gave her dad the usual, ""hi, merry christmas"" and he gave me the usual disinterested glance. 

one more example: last year i made the mistake of bringing a bottle of wine. it was a $25 bottle, which was pricey for me, and i even had the wine store lady help me pick it out. gf's mom told me to put it in the kitchen, they didn't open it while we were there, and she later admitted to gf they'd re-gifted it to their housekeeper because it was ""gas station hooch."" 

we managed to get through the day yesterday without much drama except the car thing, which i'd normally consider a win. but today i keep thinking about the whole situation with her family and wondering if i'm really willing to deal with these people for the rest of my life. gf and i have tossed around the possibility of getting married more than once but i know they'll never accept me. if we get married i'll have to see them a lot more than once a year. gf has given up trying to defend me to her parents and just ignores their bullshit most of the time, but i can tell it bothers her too. they bankroll a big chunk of her lifestyle and i think she's worried they'll cut her off if she pushes too hard (they've threatened to over other things). 

so, not to sounds like an asshole, but am i wasting my time? is this relationship doomed? gf always tells me she doesn't care what her family thinks, but i'm not sure that's true. she always tries to downplay how shitty they are to me. but i know i'll never be good enough for them, even if i'm good enough for her. 

tl;dr: my girlfriend's rich parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.",8

so when all this went down, my sister and i asked my mom to take a dna test as well. she agreed. as it turns out, my mom is not my biological mom. as i said before, it makes no difference to me because my mom is my mom no matter what. 

here is the kicker though

my mom was wholeheartedly under the impression her eggs were used in her ivf treatment. she is contacting her doctor who is still in practice to figure out what the hell this means. 

i'm actually sort of sad for my mom, i didn't consider this as an option in the realm of possibility. we are her daughters of course but i can't imagine finding out at her age with adult kids that your biological line actually ends with you. 

so yeah, guess that's all i have for now!

tldr; mom is not my mom and she is more shocked than i am.

hello everyone, i said that i'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response i got yesterday. in many ways, i was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but i found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200b;

i spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. he basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. we had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning i went back to the flat and confronted her. she was there (neither i nor her work on saturdays), and i set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner i could.

&#x200b;

 basically, i said that i didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. the wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. she basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". look, i'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. i basically said that over the weekend i'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (i'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but i stood my ground and didn't change my course. not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200b;

i left, and there is nothing much more to say really. as i type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). i'll be grand, being totally frank i feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  the coming days i'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"".
