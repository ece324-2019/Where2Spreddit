"if i left my son at home while the rest of the family went on vacation?. 

my son,11, has been acting up in school. not doing his homework, talking during lessons, picking on other kids, getting write-ups,detentions, and just being a little brat. 

at home he's disrespectful as well, picking on his siblings, talking back etc. every  other year our family takes a really big vacation. 

this year we are going to california for 3 weeks. he's never been and really- really wants to go. 

i've told him all year if he doesn't behave he won't go to california. when i remind him he behaves for a few days or so then goes back to being bratty. 

his teacher said that even if he passes all of his next test and homework he will only have a 2.3 at most(she even gave him extra credit assignments). we agreed on a 3.0 or higher for california. 

i told my son that he won't be able to go to california, he laughed and said ""yea right"". 
if i keep him home with grandma while myself and the rest of the family take the trip?

update: oh wow i did not except sooo many replies. i am reading all of them but i can't respond to everyone. i just want you to know how much i appreciate you all reaching out. the trip is next month and we(my spouse and i) have yet to come to a final decision. today my son was very disrespectful. he knocked a plate of food out of my daughters hand. and sneaked and stole back his ipad from my office. so as of today it's still a no go. which he scoffs at.  i will post an update on what we will do.  thank you all again

second update: the trip is still weeks away but my spouse and i have decided that our son will not join.  4 days ago he got into trouble for stealing his teachers purse. they found out it was him because it had her phone in it and they tracked it back to our home. he still had the purse in his closet. all of the money was gone but her medication and credit cards were untouched(clearly he's not a criminal mastermind). 
the police came to talk to him and during the whole conversation he seemed bored. he knew he wouldn't get arrested and the most i could do was send him to his room.",3

"i can get an abortion if i want.. it's my body . it's my choice.  the same goes for any woman. what we decide to do with our bodies is not up to you. 

i don't care what anyone says. you cannot change my mind. **i won't budge.**

if you have ever gotten an abortion just know you have my support. if you have ever had a baby know you have my support. if you decided to give your baby up for adoption you have my support. 

i'm pro choice. not anti life. 

edit: 283848383. a lot of people assumed one thing or another about the why of my post and the background of myself or even hypothetical questions about the nonexistent man who fathered my nonexistent child, and everything else in between. all of which were irrelevant, that's not at all what this is about. 

i made this post to show my support to **all** women who have made or will make a decision regarding **their own** bodies when it comes to making babies. your opinion is not and will not ever be needed. 

**to all of you who need it please know i stand by you and your decision. whether it be abortion, adoption, or motherhood.** 

i am in no way shape or form trying to say that abortion is a ""birth control method"".  also, just so you know birth control, condoms, vasectomies, & tubal ligation are not 100% effective .. unwanted pregnancies happen in all kinds of ways. 

i hope the amount of backlash i received is an obvious answer as to why this was an offmychest.

"i went to planned parenthood today. i grew up in the very religious south, so you can infer my upbringing was very much in line with the expectations when you read that phrase. my parents were rural farmers, so as you can imagine, i don't really come from much, and it seems like the poorer we were the more religious my parents behaved. 

i grew up to reject much of my family and community's beliefs and i pulled myself out of that place and i'm working on making something of myself. i'm currently 24 and working on a phd, trying to get my life together. i do many things that my parents don't agree with, but today may have taken the cake. 

i have recently had symptoms of pregnancy, even though i'm on birth control, so i scheduled an appointment at planned parenthood for pregnancy testing and to go over my options. i didn't go in thinking if i were pregnant that i would absolutely have an abortion, but i wanted a safe environment to weigh all the options. 

planned parenthood was everything they claim to be and more. safe, quiet, clean, judgment free, compassionate, and informational. i left with packets of resources and a calm feeling for once. 

if my parents knew that i went to planned parenthood for anything, never mind that i didn't go in for an abortion (not looking to debate on your opinion of abortion, so don't start), i committed a cardinal sin simply by seeing qualified health professionals there. 

regardless of your socioeconomic status, no matter your background and religious upbringing, don't be afraid to seek help from qualified professionals like at planned parenthood. take care of yourself, your life belongs to you only. i took a big step today, i didn't let my family's beliefs bias my seeking medical care, neither should you.",11
"i accidentally used my reddit username instead of my real name.. so i'm in college and i do some online classes. i'm actually having a really hard time in this morning class, and i am not a morning person. 

so i get to my blackboard log-in and the page uses the same form as reddit's log in. so my real name and my reddit username both show up in a drop down list. i am positive that i clicked my actual name, but i log in as whippingshitties. since the list of people attending is ascending by alphabetical order, i did not realize my mistake before my professor did. and i didn't realize it until i was kicked from the session. my professor did not have a sense of humor about it. fortunately, a few late people logged in at around the same time i logged back in with my proper name, so no one can pin me to it per-se... unless my professor can also see my ip. i'm still extremely embarrassed about it, especially since i am struggling in that class. like, yeah, it's fucking hilarious, but also what i would consider a bruh moment on my part. 

i wonder how many of my classmates googled what whipping a shitty means. 

and i wonder if any of my classmates put two and two together and looked up my /u/.

"tx/fl update: fined $13,066 from the tsa for grabbing my insulin pump. first, i'd like to thank you all for all the advice and supportive messages you all have sent me since i made this post.  i reached out to a lawyer, who drafted me a response free of charge to send back to the tsa.  i questioned his verbiage as it looked to me like i was apologizing for everything and admitting guilt.  he responded saying that yes, you are apologizing (and asking for a warning instead of a fine), but nowhere in the e-mail are you admitting guilt.  


he further stated that this is the best course of action for now and that he was 99% sure they would drop it and just give me a warning.  but should they come back with an actual fine, to contact him back for official representation.


i received the response today, and they gave me a warning.  no fine.  i am so incredibly relieved.  i know a lot of you encouraged me to sue the tsa and whatnot, but i am overjoyed that this is finally behind me.   i did have some definite fault in what transpired, and won't make that mistake again.  i do think there was some significant negligence on the tsa's part that i could have taken some action on, but frankly, i'm glad it didn't come to that.

"update my (23f) autistic husband (36m) will only eat ""kiddie food"" and lied by omission about his autism.. previous post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bobslu/update_my_23f_husband_36m_will_only_eat_kiddie/).

well.

it's been a lot longer than the one week update i promised. i could make excuses but i won't.

for those of you who don't want to read my original post, i asked for help with my husband's food preference issues and through talking with many people on here and, ultimately, his mother, it was revealed that he was diagnosed with autism as a child.

some of the comments on my original post were... not so kind. i got a lot of accusations that still hurt me. some just make me angry, particularly the person who commented simply ""please don't bully him."" he's my goddamn husband. not a schoolyard friend, not a sibling, not a child. infantilizing him doesn't help his case at all.

moving on.

i was very upset as he had never mentioned anything to me. we've discussed all sorts of medical issues together but his diagnosis never came up.

i want to stress this: this isn't a matter of me not wanting to be married to an autistic man. this is a matter of my husband keeping something important from me and causing me a great deal of stress that could have been avoided if i was aware of his diagnosis.

for example, i continuously pushed him to try new foods or attend concerts or visit loud amusement parks. i knew he wasn't particularly thrilled about any of those things but they are all very normal couple activities that i wanted us to experience together. had i been aware of his autism i would have had a better understanding of how negatively these things affected him, and made more of an effort to integrate things he liked with things i liked (maybe a smaller local band, or a craft fair instead of an amusement park).

anyways. that's the backstory. read below for the update.

**update**

i confronted him about my conversation with his mother the night before our counseling appointment. i made sure to bring it up casually so i didn't become angry again.

he tried to brush me off at first, saying he didn't know what i was talking about. after talking for a bit he eventually confessed that he not only knew of the diagnosis but deliberately kept it from me. he said i was his dream and he didn't want to do anything to ruin our ""perfect"" relationship.

i explained how him keeping this from me hurt me. i explained how i could have been there to support him instead of feeling like he needed to hide.

he said he wasn't ashamed of it at all. he explained that it's just not something that affects him anymore. i, again, explained how it affects me, but he didn't seem to care. i didn't show him the post i made but i used some of the advice from you all to try to explain why his autism really does in fact still affect his life.

we went to bed upset.

the next day he acted like nothing happened. we ate breakfast (he had chicken nuggets), and went about our day. i kept expecting him to bring it up but he never did.

i didn't have the nerve to bring it up again until later at the marriage counselor's office. i spoke to the counselor so as not to seem accusing and explained that this was an issue that bothered me.

my husband actually laughed and said he assumed i'd ""gotten over it by now"". when i explained that no, i really hadn't, he got angry with me and stormed out. the counselor tried to mediate but it wasn't much use as my husband went to wait in the car. i was worried he'd leave without me so i cut the meeting short.

our ride home was quiet. it wasn't until we got home that i said i was worried he was keeping other things from me too.

he said he'd been reading online about how women can't understand autism and therefore he didn't think it was important to tell me about it. i said that was the weakest excuse i'd ever heard. he then said that i'd leave him if i knew. i said if i left him it'd be because he's a liar.

apparently he told all of our mutual friends that he'd ""just"" been diagnosed with autism and i was considering leaving him because of it. now many of our friends won't talk to me and act very cold when we run into each other in public. i don't know what else he's told them but i think he told someone i cheated on him as a fake account has been commenting horrible things about me and my supposed sexual habits on all of my instagram posts. i keep reporting them but then it seems like another just pops up in its place. 

i haven't decided if divorce is the right path. i know he's been browsing ""incel"" and other bitter male-centric websites (one of his friends is a self-described ""incel"") so i'm even more convinced that this isn't the man i married.

i'm mostly just confused. i've been avoiding him at home and it feels like more of a room mate situation at this point. he doesn't really leave his den until it's time for work, and then he's back in the den until bed.

it seems like everything is messed up, just from me wanting to help. i don't even know what to expect at this point, much less how to move on from here.

**edit**

there are so many more comments than i anticipated. i'm trying to at least read through most of them although i think i'm past my emotional ability to reply. i'm really shocked at how overwhelmingly supportive people are being. thank you.

i'm going to be discussing divorce with a lawyer. i don't know how to bring it up with him but i'm past the point of caring. you're all right; i dread coming home to him in the evenings, i dread if he will miraculously want to talk. this isn't healthy for either of us. at the very least some time apart would be good.

that's all for now. i don't think i'll update past this, as i'm already uncomfortable with how quickly this blew up. but i will be living elsewhere by the end of the month.",7
"by getting my work raided by the swat team.. so today about 5 minutes before my shift started, i was looking at the desk in the back and realized a small circular object that looked like an alien. it had two eyes, then a mouth that was pretty small at the bottom of it. stupid me, not knowing what the fuck it was decides to press both of the buttons to see if it did anything or what it was, and the mouth part of the object lit up red for a second. holding it in my hand, my manager walks past and i say:


 ""hey kyle, what's this thing?""


his eyes go into panic mode and says ""whatever you do, do not press that button."" 


i'm like ""well what is it?"" 


""it's the silent alarm, put it back."" 


i just think oh fuck. ""umm, i kinda pressed it like 2 minutes ago."" 


""wait are you being serious?""


""yeah, fuck.""


he goes and tells my other manager and they're like well shit, they know the cops are gonna show up any second since even if we called them they are required to come anyways. to add to this, before they come in they are supposed to call the store to check to see if it was a false alarm or if we didn't answer there was actually an emergency. well guess what, our phone system was down today so we couldn't receive calls. 


a few minutes later as i'm working, all of my coworkers and managers start looking outside like holy shit. i'm like ""what?"" turns out the whole perimeter was being surrounded by law enforcement. nothing happens for a couple more minutes until a whole fleet of cops flood the building. one of them starts talking with my managers while the others start searching the whole restaurant. everyone in the building eating was like ""what the actual fuck is going on."" after the whole situation was explained everything was resolved and they all left, but boy was it a fuck up on my part. lesson learned? don't push random buttons at work. 


to add even more to this, two of the cops who raided the place earlier came in a few hours later to get something to eat. i obviously gave them their food for free and they were really happy about that. one of them asks me ""so who was the fucker who set off the alarm?"" i was just like ""umm, that would be me officer"" and start explaining the story of how it happened. they were both laughing, said it was fine and that it happens all the time (surprisingly). they were just happy they got some free dinner, and i'm glad i could make their night a little better :)


tldr: pressed a random button at work that ended up being the silent alarm, swat team surrounded the perimeter and raided the building, came back and got some free food later. 


edit: you guys are probably right in saying it wasn't the swat team, i didn't know any better but i remember there being maybe 5 cops inside and more outside very heavily armed (way more armed than i've seen normal cops). either way it was defiantly a spectacle to watch.

i cant play with my daughters and everytime i go to one of their soccer matches i get weird looks and take all the attention off of them.

i just dont have any fight left anymore. i repeat to myself everyday, ""its over, and thats ok"".

the truth is i haven't accomplished much in my life. i wanted to be a writer when i was younger but i ended up as an office manager at a car dealership. i always said i would do it later but then the years sort of piled on. i had one life and i wasted it, but so do most people i guess.

i am proud of my wife and daughters. they make me very happy. they haven't accepted that its over yet but i have. my wife means well but she wants me to stay in treatment long enough to put it back into remission again. i dont see it. i just think we need to come to terms with this.

i do not just want to lay in bed all day. i want to travel for these years i have left. see the country. maybe go to italy or japan or the uk. i want to experience this planet in ways i never thought about before.

my questions are:

 what paperwork would they even be able to file?

 should i be doing anything else to make sure that i am not legally in the wrong (such as brining in my birth certificate as proof) ?

"is it normal to ask salaried employees to clock-in?...and then threaten to withhold pay for working less than 40 hours?. i work for a small business that employs around 100 people. i'd guess that maybe 10 of us are salaried and everyone else is hourly. up until last year, i was also hourly until my boss who is also the ceo/owner told me that i would be switching to a salaried position, but to keep clocking in as usual. nothing changed except that my checks were now always the same amount with ""0"" hours worked instead of 40, 41, whatever.   

a couple of weeks ago, i had a small medical emergency that informed them off, and i had to go to the doctor in the afternoon so i left early around 1pm and didn't come back that day. our hr director emailed me today and told me that salaried employees are expected to work 40 hours and told me that i was only at 36 for that pay period. he ended the email with ""what do you want to do about this?""   

so i walked over to him and told him why i was missing hours, and asked him what they end of his message meant. i asked if my boss (the owner) was trying to say that he was going to withhold money for missing those hours. the hr director said ""yes"". i told him that made no sense since i was salaried, and he stuttered and stammered and i told him that i will make sure i'm always hitting my 40 hours (as i have been) but that this seems ridiculous. he said that we were ok and not to worry about it.   

so my questions: is it normal to ask salaried employees to clock in? is it normal to then threaten to withhold pay if they don't hit 40 hours worked per week? is it even legal for them to do that? if not, and they threaten to do it again, what should i do?   

edit: for those who asked, i have zero interactions with outside clients. i do project management and excel work all day every day.  

edit 2: holy crap this thread exploded! a few answers to your guys' main questions:  

1) i was given no contract. i was sent an email telling me i was now salaried and to keep clocking in/out   
2) i get 10 days of pto, but was never instructed that i was required to work 40 hours or that i would still get overtime   
3) i work more than 40 hours plenty of time, including the week prior to this. like i said, it is extremely rare for me to not be at work. i have called in sick three times in the last five years.

"me (15f) my mom (30sf) cares more about drinking and fucking guys than being a parent.. yo i'm 15 and utterly clueless how to deal with my ""mother""

that's in quotes because she doesn't act like one. never has. i don't know who my dad was. neither does she. yep she's that kind of person.

none of my siblings dads are around. they're either locked up or didn't care or she refuses to talk to them for who knows why. she stopped persuing child support from the one she had contact with bc it was ""too much work"" but when she used to get the child support, she just spent it all on shit for herself. like tattoos, alcohol, clothes.

she's addicted to online shopping, the apartment is stuffed with her shit and she doesn't even use most of it. also she doesn't clean. i have to clean (i'm the oldest) or it doesn't happen. before i learned to clean, we got tons of ants and flies, we had roaches for months before she finally was willing to pay for getting rid of them. said she ""didn't want to waste money"", but she wastes money all the time on whatever she wants. food and bills are an after thought. she has wic but literally can't be bothered to get us food unless i nag her when we're flat out. then she just loads up with garbage from the dollar store, so i'm really worried about my siblings, bc some of them are getting really overweight and she doesn't ever take us to the doctor and i don't even know if we've got health insurance.

she bounces around between temp jobs, nothing permanant, bc if she worked fulltime she couldn't party. she's almost always out at night sometimes during the day. or she's passed out drunk. i've dragged her to her bed bc she blacked out in the bathroom or on the floor. or, some random dude shows up after midnight hauling her in the door as she's unable to walk. how do these men have keys??? she just copies the key and gives it to literally anyone she trusts. which is practically everyone, she has no idea who's a good person or bad person. as a result there are men who have touched me when i was younger. now i can fight them and protect myself and my siblings. she never protects us. she doesn't care. she called me a liar bc that's her boyfriend so he wouldn't do that blah blah blah. 

there is a revolving door of these ""boyfriends."" they don't last longer than a year and even when she's with a guy guaranteed she's fucking at least one other. me and my siblings can clearly hear the telltale slapping sounds and disgusting groaning and fakeass porno screeches coming from her room. it's happened at all hours of the night waking us up. we've even found nasty sex toys and fetish outfits in places outside of her bedroom.

she's pregnant right now (kid number 8) and still doing this. still drinking too. i mean what the fuck, i started suspecting she's doing this for money (she's randomly suddenly had cash after nights like that after saying there was no money for food or whatever) and asked if she was a prostitute, she slapped me across the face. well that's my answer i guess. i know she's been a stripper so it's more than likely. anyway i still said why is she okay poisoning a baby and risking one of these abusive guys injuring it, she said i can't judge her until i'm a mother. so whatever. i'm never gonna be one looooool

then, despite constantly being broke and relying on the minor government aid + whatever these fuckboys give her (she begs online for donations all over social media), she went and got a huge fucking boobjob a couple years ago. i was only 13 but i've been constantly aware of our poverty. i've been bullied for it, even my 5 year old brother got teased at school about his clothes. it's impossible to not be aware. i started learning when rent and bills are due to try to get my mom to keep on top of it so our electricity and heat stops getting shut off. then she goes and buys fake tits. it's like, what is even the point. she's gonna blow her money every time no matter what i do.

i'm so scared and sick of always worrying about money. we've been evicted 5 times that i can remember. utilities shut off countless times. half the time i have to make my younger siblings ramen for dinner because it's all i can afford from the change she leaves us.

i'm so sick of the grossness of the apartment, the grossness of the men always coming and going, her dressing like a hooker, using her tits to get men now that she looks twice her age thanks to alcohol addiction, the trashiness of everything in my life. the apartment is 3 bedrooms with half the living room hosting me and my next oldest sister's bunk beds and the other half hosting my mom's piles of junk. the rest of my siblings are split between the other two bedrooms and then my mom has the third. everyone's room is covered in clothes toys books and random junk on the floor, bc there's simply no space for anything that could store it. garbage and masses of toiletries/cosmetics in the bathroom and mold in the shower. garbage always overflowing in the kitchen. dirty stove fridge and oven i can never stay on top of. everything's old and falling apart. no ac or fans in 90+ heat. it's just shit. she couldn't care less she's hardly ever here so sees no reason to care.

i hate that i can't give my siblings a better childhood. i hate that she won't make a single effort to do that when it's her responsibility, she's the parent not me, but i cannot stand to see them neglected. they all see me and my next oldest sister as parents more than her. we are ""their moms"" they say. we bathe them and dress them, do laundry when we can. we take care of each other when we're sick.

please get one thing clear from my post besides that i hate my mom, it's that i love my brothers and sisters. i would do anything to make their lives just a little better. but i don't know how when we're stuck living in this place with this person. i realized we'll have to get out on our own for things to get better but even once i'm old enough, they won't be. i could adopt them but i doubt i could get custody of all 6 + the baby that's coming + however many fucking more kids she decides to pop out over the next 3 years.

plus even though they listen to me about hygiene and chores they don't listen about school. no matter what i try, short of bribing with junk food i can't get them to do their homework. but i'm a hypocrit bc i don't always do mine either, i don't have time sometimes or i'm so tired i just can't.

""sandy"" is 62. we are 53 and have retirement savings but it would be hard. what q's do we need to ask to help them plan and to make the right decision for sandy and for us?. edit: my husband would quit his job tomorrow to move back east and take care of her. if it wasn't for me he'd take it on and hope it all works out. i'm more practical and i want to make sure we know how assets (or lack of) affect care decisions. the wording is because of complicated family relationships. it's his stepsister but they grew up together and have a great relationship. but the two sets of parents met on a tennis court and wound up swapping partners so it all gets...weird. her mother only sends a birthday card once a year; her full brother said he was unwilling to help. she lives with my husband's mother, her stepmother, and her father/my husband's stepfather. she was set up to go live with my sister-in-law but that sister's life has seen some difficult challenges over the past few years and i think my in-laws are reluctant to ask her to take on more. because of this long existing plan, we know relatively little about how things are set up and obviously we want to make sure the parents have enough for themselves as they continue to age and eventually pass on. the question is not whether we are willing, exactly, just what we need to know about the financial side to plan for what happens next.

"college student without a credit card, just found out that i have a credit score.. i'm 19 years old and currently attending a cc and was looking for starter credit cards to start building my credit score. i read that i should first make a credit karma account just to make sure if i do or don't have a credit score. 

well i made the account and found out that i have a i have 772 credit score. basically my parents made me an authorized user on their credit card about about 1.5 year ago and have been building my credit for me. i use the credit card all the time but i never thought that it was my own credit card. i'm really grateful to them for it because they know how important credit score is in the adult world. 

my question is: should i still look for a new credit card under my own name or should i continue being an authorized user under my parents? 

edit: thank you guys for all your advice! i'm going to remain an authorized user under my parents credit card. i'll also be getting my own credit card as well. i read every single comment and appreciate all the advice! ",10
"update i had gone for 1 week vacation and gave my house keys to my a friend to look after and take care of my 2 dogs at my house. now, he gave keys to his gf and let her stay at my home. she isn't leaving now after i come home. i called cops, but they say this would be a civil matter. what to do?. santa monica, ca 
 
good morning, guys. this is an uplifting update. 
 
first of all, i'd like to thank all of you guys for such an overwhelming response.i'm glad that there are people who would spend time from their busy life to help a random stranger on internet. :) 
 
so, after reading all of advises here and carefully discussing this matter with my cousin, we made a nasty plan. yesterday night that squatter girl went outside to grab some dinner with her bf. me and my cousin carefully packed all of her stuffs in her three bag left in in our front porch and locked ourselves in house. we also looked over her stuffs from window to make sure no one steals it. 
 
our wait was over after 2 hours when girl returned. she figured it out and started pounding at our door, yelling loudly to open door, you know typical squatter drama. we told her to go fuck off and we won't open the door. so, finally after 30 minutes of constant drama, she dared to call cops. i was nervous how it would turn out. 
 
cops arrived. fortunately these were different ones than previous night. first they listened to her side. then they came to me. i explicitly told them that i was sole owner of house and never allowed girl to stay more than 1 night. she was not only trespassing but also living in my house illegally without my permission. bitch kept saying i had given permission to stay there indefinitely and now kicking her out. officer said she has any proof of that? she claimed she had some message which accidentally got deleted. 
  
now the best part, officer then asked her for an id. she gave id. officer verified it over radio. suddenly, they told him this bitch had a failure to appear warrant for months old shoplifting case. stupid lady was arrested immediately. his stuffs were send to friend's house. officer said that i don't need to worry and they'll take care of her. i do not require any further action. 
  
so, finally i'm relived from that squatter and bitch is behind bars. what a justice boner! 
 
all's well that ends well. :)
 
tl, dr: previously there was bad cop, then comes good cop and justice is served. :)

"i stopped putting my mom as my emergency contact because i didn't want her to be the first notified when i killed myself. today i put her as my emergency contact again for the first time in years.. tw: abuse and suicide

from october 2015 to the end of june 2017 i was in a relationship with a horrifying man. he was a sadistic, sociopathic rapist who seemed to take special pleasure in driving me to kill myself. 

one night in april 2017 i told him i was going to kill myself with the bottle of pain killers we kept in the bathroom. i described exactly how i would, and i told him i'd do it with barbiturates but i couldn't afford them so i was going to swallow the bottle of painkillers instead. i told him i was going to do it tonight and that he needed to contact my therapist immediately. he shoved me, shouted ""jesus christ"", and then went to go play video games with our roommate. they turned the volume as high as it could go but i could still hear them laughing. i didn't take the pills. my best friend talked me out of it. i fell asleep but woke up multiple times that night to my ex biting me as hard as he could. i still had bite marks the next day. when i asked him why he bit me, he told me, ""i thought you killed yourself. i was checking if you were still alive."" 

that was when i knew he wanted me dead. 

i was suicidal long before that night and until the end of our relationship. even after i left him, i would have episodes where i would figure out what pills i had in the house and then look up how long it would take for me to die from swallowing all of them. i also looked up how much of a mess it would make. i didn't want my roommates to have to clean up a room full of shit and vomit after the paramedics put me in a body bag. that usually happened when i screwed something up. but i haven't had an episode like that since november. 

during this time, whenever i had to fill out emergency contact information on anything, i would never put anyone in my family. my mom had always been my emergency contact up until this time. but i stopped putting her on there. before i was born, she lost my half brother when he was two years old. her mom, my grandmother, put him in bed for a nap one morning and he never woke up. my mom's the one who found his body. no one comforted her and everyone blamed her, even though his death wasn't anyone's fault. 

i didn't want my mom to have to relive that. i didn't want her to be the first person in the world who knew i was dead. i knew she would have to find out eventually, but i wanted her to find out from someone who loves her. not from a stranger. 

but today i was filling out an application for a master's in law program, and i just finished filling out the emergency contact information when i realized i put my mom's name down. i realized it's been a long time since i wanted to kill myself. i'm not actively worried anymore of her being told that i died because, short of some accident, that's not a likely possibility. 

i just wanted to put this out there. ",11

"most countries require your passport to be valid for 3-6 months after your scheduled return date (us). most countries require that your passports expiration date is atleast 3 months after your scheduled return date. make sure you renew it before you travel even if you have a few months before it expires.

"shower poo. basically i used to date a guy that was also friends with my best friends boyfriend. so at one stage the four of us had been together for about four days, and i was still at that stage of pretending i don't poo.

we had been living of meegoreng, easy mac and maccas and went to block buster to get some dvds out. the whole time my stomach felt like it was about to explode! i kept sitting on the carpet pretending i was interested in the dvds on the bottom shelf but really i was  using the floor as some kind of barrier/plug to stop the dreaded mess from escaping out of me. 

finally we got back to the guys house all ready for a night of movies and.. more food. i could feel the beads of sweat dripping down my forehead and the more the boys asked me why i was being so quiet, the more i felt the poo would eventually have no choice but to come out my mouth. but i knew i had tried to keep it in too long so what would come out would be an absolute horror show. the toilet that was directly outside alexes room just wasn't an option. 

i decided to go for a shower to cool myself down and go over my options. as soon as i got in that water i felt my self automatically sit on the floor, and before i knew it was sitting on what looked like a pile of heavy green horse poo. 

as soon as it left my body i knew i fucked up. 

i had to act quickly so began mashing it down the drain with my knuckles, pushing it in the whole with my finger tips and trying to scrape the smears of poo from the cracks of the tiles.  i then grabbed what ever cleaning product i could find in the cupboard and began pouring it all over the shower and spraying perfume prefusely. i'm still dumbfounded they never smelt it as soon as i pood (unless they just didn't want to embarrass me) 

i remember laying in the bed after wards feeling so traumatised and paranoid the poo would emerge on the next person to have a shower. the only thing i can say i learnt from this is be a normal person and go to the toilet. ",12
"i'm a married father of four in norcal. we scratched our way out of homelessness and poverty but can't seem to avoid being smothered by credit card debt. advice please!. i'll level with you all: we've weathered some rough years and need real advice to help us dig out of our debt, change our habits and get some financial stability. i've been following this group for a while but after looking into debt consolidation and bankruptcy and realizing how devastating it would be on our already bad credit, we've decided to finally bite the bullet and ask you all for help. 

background: my family spent a few years homeless following one huge and several small layoffs for both my wife and myself in a very short period of time. we lost our home, our vehicles, everything material and moved 6 times in just a couple years (always sleeping on couches or sharing one bed with our four kids… whatever it took) in pursuit of stability and jobs that always ended up falling through. three years ago a local program helped pay the deposit on an apartment and provided interview clothes and within days i landed a reliable job working for our county and we've been in that apartment and i've been working at that job ever since. i'm even expecting a raise in november. my wife recently went back to work part time to help us catch up on payments. unfortunately she can't work full time because we have to rely on family members for childcare for our four children.

two of our children overcame some pretty serious medical conditions during these past few years of stability, requiring us to live at hospitals for long periods of time. having only recently started working and barely moving into an actual apartment at the time, we relied heavily on credit cards to stay afloat during those periods, even taking out several cards and maxing them out to cover living expenses, groceries and even our own costs while staying with our children at the hospitals. i know, i know: it's bad. and just when we were finally financially recovering from the first child's medical situation, our youngest ended up in the hospital (recently) and we dug ourselves back into credit card debt all over again. 

we want to have an emergency fund. we want to have savings. we want to have financial stability and maybe even eventually buy a house. so we're asking for your help. any guidance and suggestions is deeply appreciated.

so far, we've downsized as much as we can at the moment. we live in northern california and our family of 6 lives in a tiny 800 square foot 2 bedroom/1 bath apartment. our internet/cell phone bill is the minimal speed and data plan needed for my wife's job, which requires her to work from home fairly often. basic cable comes with the apartment for free. we are also responsible for maintaining a storage unit until a family dispute has been resolved and the contents can be distributed, most likely in a couple months. we have one vehicle that we bought used about a year ago and have never been late paying on. it has $4,500 remaining to pay it off and is really only used to take the kids to school and get groceries since we walk to work. we get an excellent rate on car and renters insurance through my work, which is deducted from my paycheck with my other benefits and therefore not reflected in the following breakdown. and yes, we know the payday loans are bad but they are another product of our daughter's recent hospital situation but we are forced to renew it for the smallest possible amount each month until we can pay them off in full. we regret ever taking them out but are stuck until we can inch them down to an amount we can afford to payoff in full. at the time, it was the only way to pay rent while sleeping on folding chairs in a hospital several hours away from our home and our other children while our baby was fighting for her life. here is the complete breakdown:

**income:**

* $1,075 and $400 (so $1,475 total) bi-weekly (which will go up to $1,675 in november)

**expenses:**

* $880 rent

* $600 food ($150 per week for a family of 6)

* $450 credit card payments ($11,000 spread over 13 cards)

* $225 car payment ($4,500 remaining balance)

* $150 electricity

* $250 other necessities (diapers, wipes, toiletries, school needs, medical copays, gas)

* $100 propane

* $100 phone/internet

* $90 storage unit

* $88 monthly fees for rolling payday loan


like i said, we understand the credit cards are the biggest problem but we need advice on the best way to tackle them and start a savings so we can build an emergency fund and never have to rely on cards and payday loans again. my wife does all kinds of odd jobs from home when she can (independant writer, mystery shopper, making things to sell, you name it) to bring in bits of extra money when possible while avoiding us from having to pay for childcare for her to work full time. we did the math and she would be actually making significantly less than she does now if she worked full time and we paid for childcare. i've also been submitting applications for higher paying positions, so fingers crossed one of those comes through. in the meantime i need advice on how to tackle our situation. i've read all the guides and links in this group but we're so overwhelmed i'm not sure where to start. any help is appreciated. thank you.

*edit: formatting*

**edit: a lot of people are asking why we don't qualify for more benefits or assistance programs and i realized i wasn't very clear: the income amount i provided is our net income. our gross income is much higher but 72% of our income goes to benefits and taxes. yes, i know it's a lot but the net pay is still better than i've found anywhere else (so far). our health insurance alone (just for my wife and i) is $750 each pay period (bi-weekly) for the minimal required coverage (per aca regulations). the kids still qualify for medi-cal but won't once my scheduled raise goes through in november. our younger two will also lose wic in november. we don't qualify for snap or any other programs.**",10

"my mother and sister had a car crash. my mother died, while my sister survived with a brain injury. how to continue?. tl;dr at the bottom.

&#x200b;

my family owes two bakeries, about 60 kilometres from each other, so we kinda split up - me (27) and my sister (23) managed the one in the smaller town, while my father (53), mother (46), other sister (25) and brother (21) managed the one in the big city. on november 18th, my mother and sister came to visit us, like they did most  sundays. my mother woke me up but i didn't get up right away - i had been drinking the previous night because it was my friend's birthday and was really hungover. after a while, i managed to get up and hang out with my mom for a while, but i was just waiting for them to leave because i really wanted to get back to bed. i am probably never going to drink again.

around 12:05pm they decided to take off. before going, my mother started to scold me like she always did - ""you need to get married, you're 27 years old, i want grandchildren!"". i just laughed and shrugged ""you're not even 47 yet, where's the rush?"". i got up, hugged her and kissed her, said goodbye and went back to sleep, not realising that that was the last time i will ever talk to her. i remember my last thought before falling asleep was ""what if they have an accident?""

&#x200b;

it happened about 35 minutes later. they were 15 minutes from home. we still don't know what really happened, only that my sister was driving and my mother was asleep. if she had been awake, she would have probably survived with some minor injuries, maybe a concussion. but it didn't go that way.

we found out about an hour and a half after it happened. my father called to ask if they had left our place. that was the first alarm. i tried to call them both, but no one answered. took a look at the different communication apps we used - they weren't online since they left. that was the second alarm. tried to call them one more time, still no answer. i'm panicking. i open up a news site, but there's nothing on it. i open up another one and i see a picture. a picture of our car. title: car crash - one dead, one with heavy injuries. 

i got a friend of mine to drive me and my sister to the hospital where they took my other sister because i was physically and psychologically unfit to drive. it was the first in a really long series of terribly agonising rides. we still didn't know who died and who survived. i will probably always hate myself for wishing at that moment that it was mom that made it, even though i knew that her's and dad's remaining life would probably be hell. but mom died on the spot. 

if only she hand't been sleeping. if only they hadn't drop by. if only they had taken dad's car with all the extra security measures. if only i hadn't been hungover and told them to stay a bit longer. if only.

&#x200b;

my sister had a hematoma and they had to preform brain surgery. she also broke her left elbow, right wrist and a couple of fingers on her right hand, but nothing too serious. the brain surgery went extremely well and she was put into an induced coma for three days. she woke up the next day, which was a really good sign and remained in intensive care for the next two weeks, before being transfered to post-intensive neurological care, which she is finally leaving tomorrow.

she's coming home for a week or two before her physical and psychological rehabilitation starts. she is currently really depressed after staying for so long at the hospital and having such a mess in her head. the biggest problem though? she still doesn't know mom died. a few days ago, i asked her if she remembered all the people that came to visit her. one of the people she mentioned was mom, which got me a bit. she probably didn't remember that well, but she just assumed that mom would come by. we are all scared to death because we don't know how will that information affect her psychological health and that it will depress her even further. and the time for telling her is almost upon us - in a maximum of 10 hours, she will be home and she will notice that someone is missing. it's gonna be hard. it's gonna be painful.

&#x200b;

i really miss my mom. i cry almost every night when i drive back home and all i can think about is her. i miss her hugs, i miss talking to her. i miss her scolding me. i miss telling her every night how much money we made that day and i miss her calling me in the morning to ask me if i'm awake. i miss her voice. i can't look at her pictures and i hate myself for it. but the worst thing is thinking about the future that doesn't include her. i think about all the possible good things that might happen in life - all the business successes, our family growing - and she isn't there to share our joy. i see old couples walking on the streets and feel sad that she never got the chance to grow old. i expected her to live for at least 30 more years. hell, sometimes i thought she will outlive me. 

life is cruel - it makes you work really hard, put in your blood, sweat and tears for the good things, but it only takes a single moment for everything to fall to pieces. just a couple of weeks earlier, i was telling a friend of mine that i finally felt satisfied with my life. business was good, i finally payed off a loan, i was healthier than ever and everyone was in a really good mood. i wonder why the hell i even said anything. now the only thing stopping me from killing myself is not wanting to hurt my family even more. they just don't deserver to have to deal with another tragedy.

every night, when i go to sleep, i pray i somehow manage to turn back time. i wish to relive that morning and try to change things. and every morning i wake up disappointed that i failed. i might start wishing a meteor hits us so this suffering ends.

&#x200b;

i wish i was more religious and that i believed in some form of afterlife - an afterlife where i will get the chance to see my mother again, tell her about all the stuff she missed out on, and one day introduce her to all of her grandchildren. but every inch of my body tells me that that's not how it works and that that day was truly her end. every single cell tells me that life is just a series of infuriatingly tragic moments that ends with an endless darkness and silence. if we're lucky enough, our body will overload with all the different happiness hormones so our brain manages to give us the happiest thoughts right before we go back nothingness. 

but god do i hope i'm wrong.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

tl;dr

 \- mom died in car crash

 \- sister still doesn't know because she suffered brain injury, even though it's been more than a month since it happened

 \- life sucks

 \- i want to die but can't because it would crush the rest of the family even more

 \- i wish i believed there was an afterlife, but i don't

 \- please someone give me a time machine or arrange a meeting with someone that will buy my soul in exchange for reverting all of this

"i took a vacation day, lied to my wife, and am currently in a hotel room for the day.. lighti live in a small, two bedroom townhouse with my wife and my two daughters both under the age of 3. there is no quiet, there is no alone time. the girls sleep in their bedroom but wake us up all night. my boss is always riding me, my mother just came out of rehab pills! fuck doctors who overprescribe opiates, my father is leaning too heavily on me, and we just passed the anniversary of my mother-in-law's death -- a time that understandbly makes my wife very very emotional.

using a website that books hotels during the daytime eg 8a - 6pm, i reserved a room at a hotel that's about halfway between where i work and home. this morning, i left the house as usual, went out for a nice breakfast, then checked into the hotel.

i have spent the day alternately sleeping and whacking off in peace and quiet. the blinds are all drawn, and this bed is so goddamn comfortable. i'll check out in a couple of hours, then drive home.

my wife will never know that i spent the day pampering myself.

//edit: yes, of course my wife needs days off as well. and i give them to her, often. in fact, this coming saturday is her day out of the house by herself. 

//further edit:  i paid for this on my personal credit card -- wife and i each have personal checking accounts and credit cards in addition to our joint accounts. we set this up for ourselves when we got married, because we recognized the need for a private life in addition to our life together.

//furthest edit: re-edited this to take away the website i used.

//even further edit: holy shit, this has generated a lot of response. let's talk, everybody:  

(1) literally have never watched shark tank, don't have cable, don't even have a tv set up regularly in the house we didn't like how attached our daughter was to it, so we unplugged. so... no. not working for corporate america. look at my post history too... it's mostly about finances, rental cars, and general life things.  sunday night i was thinking about how nice it would be to have this kind of service, then found out that it's fairly common in europe, then was glad to find that one hotel in my city offered it.

(2) did end up telling my wife about this last night. she laughed, and said something along the lines of ""why did you tell me? sounds like it would be more fun to keep it a secret!""  my marriage is cool.  we give each other space to do our own things because we trust that we're not cheating or setting our family on fire or anything. all in all, this whole excursion ran me about $100, between the hotel and the food. $100 is not something that we freak out over in our house.

"by mentally scarring my female co-worker nsfw. this happened last week but am still brooding over it 24/7 so hoping getting it off my chest may help...

so anyway, work in quite a large office building. one of those offices shared by multiple companies. we have normal male and females bathrooms but also one unisex bathroom which only has a single toilet and the unspoken rule is that it is female only. i believe in equality so disregard this rule regularly.

i always check to make sure the coast is clear and press my ear against the door before exiting to make sure i don't hear any footsteps in the corridor.

so one of my regular uses of this bathroom is to expel any unwanted gas. my office room is mostly women so being a gentlemen i never pass in that confined space. i go to the unisex bathroom, blow my trumpet and return with no one the wiser.

i sensed a disturbance from the depths so headed for the bathroom as usual. i was on the edge of erupting so had to sprint walk with every muscle clenched. in haste, i forgot to lock the door behind me.

now when i expel i also like to pull down my pants and underwear because i am always mindful of the smell clinging to the fabric of my clothes and hanging around with you for most of the day. probably paranoia but better safe than sorry. i pull down my pants and launch. was a great one. a perfect b flat minor.

i peered over my shoulder because it felt a little harder to pass than usual. sitting on the floor was a little poo nugget. not too large, maybe the size of a medium strawberry.

that's when my life changed forever. i heard the door handle jiggle before it swung open.

there i was, naked from the waist down looking over my shoulder at a piece of my own shit.

it was a small asian woman. she looked at me, then at the poo and then back at me. pale as a ghost. she quickly shut the door as i heard her heels scurry back down the corridor.

she's not with my company but i still recognized her from the break room. for a week now i haven't left my office. i don't want to see her and feel like she's told everyone and they won't stop staring at me. i like this job but part of me wants to skip town and never return. this is what you get for being chivalrous!

"for thinking about leaving my wife because she is adopting her nieces and nephew?. obvious throwaway because i have friends who know my personal account.

&#x200b;

so i've known my wife for 9 years, we dated for 5, and we've been married for just under 6 months.  she comes from an insanely toxic family, she was emancipated at 16 and to this day refuses to speak to any of her family. they are all addicted to meth and her sister to meth + anything she can get her hands on. her sister has 3 kids, ages 9 months (f), 6 years (m), and 13 years (f). my wife began taking care of these children when the first was born when she was only 7 years old because no one else would. for whatever reason cps never took the kids away despite near constant monitoring and the last my wife knew of these kids was 3 years ago when she permanently cut her family off. 

&#x200b;

her parents always assumed she would adopt any children her sister produced (this actually was the beginning of the rift that led to her cutting her parents off) and were never shy about it. when we started dating (she was 15, i was 17) i told her that if she adopted those kids then the relationship wouldn't work out because if i am having kids they are going to need to be my own **(edit: my mind was going at a million miles per hour when i typed this. this is not an all-encompassing statement. when i typed it i was focused on my current situation. i would not be opposed to marrying someone with kids already, i just expected to never raise these children and i do not want to.)** . she agreed and said she had no desire to ever adopt those kids. 

  
i just deleted like 5 paragraphs worth of useless details because i'm just ranting. i will just get to the point, so out of the blue last week she tells me that she feels guilty about leaving the children behind and she is planning on reaching out to her sister to formally adopt them.  i told her hell no, i made it clear very early on that i do not want to raise those kids. she told me that she assumed i would ""grow out of it"" and accept them. we argued and have been arguing over and over for days now about her decision. she has since reached out to her sister and has started the process of adopting the children. the oldest girl is pregnant, the middle child is a decent kid, and the youngest one only got out of prenatal icu 5 months ago due to the mother's incessant abuse of drugs during pregnancy.   i am 22, she is 20. i think even if i wanted to adopt these kids i would still want to say no due to our age and financial situation (she works at a make up store, i work at a grocery store for fucks sake)

i haven't straight up told her that i am planning on leaving yet but i've already told my parents that if she doesn't stop then that is my plan.  am i the asshole here?

"tx- disgruntled ex employee came back to work a week ago and stabbed me. i am being fired because of it.. i just now got out of the hospital. last monday on the 28th, i had an old employee we let go on friday come in. now this is not unusual as people generally forgot things when they leave. i asked him what he was doing here. 

he said he needed to talk to me about what happened. this guy was let go for budget reasons. simple as that. we cut 5 employees and he unfortunately made the cut. 

i informed him that there was no real reason why he was let go. just a business decision and that we would have glowing letters of recommendation for him, will not interfere with unemployment, and will actually give good references for everyone who called. 

this point he claims its bullshit and gets hostile. i try to calm him down as does many other workers nearby. his friend tried to say he would take him to lunch and pay. basically everyone knew he needed to leave at this point. 

he seemed to calm down, but then pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed me in the stomach. i did not even realize i had been stabbed yet as i saw the knife and reacted. i grabbed his arm and held it firmly. the adrenaline was running through me so much i did not realize i had been stabbed yet until i saw the blood. i started to panic and punched him with my free hand in the jaw a few times. i guess one of them hit home as he dropped to the ground. 

i sat down in on the ground holding the knife in me as i knew it was probably the only thing keeping me from bleeding out. the other workers that were there held him down until the police arrived. the ambulance took me and i went in for surgery. 

today i receive a phone call that i do not have to return to work. i told my boss that i would be ready for light duty on monday. he said that my health was not what he meant. one of the hr guys saw me punch the fired worker a few times and said that my face was like ""a vicious animal."" exact words. 

i told my boss that this was to be expected when fight or flight kicks in. he agreed with me and said that he wished he did not have to do this. but that everyone who got physical with the former employee will probably be let go pending a review by legal. 

this will make me lose my insurance. i am worried about continuing medical issues. the stab wound is still infected, but i have been given both pills and a cream for this. 

i am mainly worried about losing the job. is there any kind of suit i can bring up if i am fired for this? i know you can sue someone for anything you want, i am asking about suits that would have a reasonable chance of winning given a good lawyer. 

also is it legal for my job to fire me and the guys who helped over this? the guy was only out for maybe half a minute so he was still a danger. it took the police 12 minutes to show up. hello the ambulance was forced to wait outside for 5 minutes until the police showed up to secure the situation. this guy had plenty of time to harm other people. how can a job just up and fire everyone like this? im guessing yes because texas, but is this even legal?",2

"i believe it should be illegal, with very limited exceptions, to fire someone for something they said or did outside of the workplace.. i am so glad i found this forum, as i think i have something to contribute!  this always gets downvoted when i'm arguing elsewhere so i think it would fit in here.

lately there's been a whole lot of posts on reddit, and elsewhere, where ""oh look this guy said the n word on twitter and a bunch of people called up his work and he got fired, let's all laugh nazi tears qq!""  no matter how despicable someone's views are, something about this, and the celebration of it, doesn't sit right with me.

this isn't so much about trying to protect people that say racist shit on twitter.  this is about workplace protections for employees, how much of bullshit ""at-will employment"" really is, and wanting to see all employees essentially carry what amount to union protections currently.

i work in a job that has these protections.  trust me, there are many things you can do that will get you fired, and there are some things that you can do outside the workplace that will still get you fired.  thing is, that list is very clear-cut with little if any wiggle room.

did you commit a felony?  yeah, you're gone regardless of when or where.

did you commit a misdemeanor, but it was something related to your line of work?  yeah, that's enough to fire.  like...if you're an accountant but you get busted for fraud, or retail and you were caught shoplifting from kohl's or something.  because it's specifically related to your daily duties it's enough to let go of someone.

but beyond that, you're not going to get fired.  did you get in a fight with some guy at a bar over the weekend and get locked up?  okay, you'll get called an idiot, but you're not going to face disclipline at work over it (nor should you.)

there's also a very clear-cut social media policy.  if it's on a forum that's run by the employer, they can discipline you based on what you said.  if it's on the internet anywhere, but you did it from a company device, or on company time, they can nail you.  but outside of work, outside of the employer's forum, and off of company-issued devices?  nope, you can't be touched for it (unless it breaks one of the above felony/misdemeanor rules, which is usually pretty hard to do on social media.)

""but what about fields that hold someone to a higher standard, like lawyers or doctors or police?  they'd look horrible if they had to continue to employ someone that went on some bigoted rant!""

and i get that, which is why the employer should get some outs - but nothing as easy as ""oh, we just get to say you don't work here any more because we feel like it and you made us look bad.""  we're giving way too much power to sjws and internet mobs by allowing for doxxing to have an instant life-ruin effect on someone, even if the person is an asshole.

morality clauses in contracts are fine in some cases - but not as a ""you agree to this to get the job.""  it should run more like ""okay, we're paying you $x/hour for your normal time, and an additional smaller $x/hour, above your standard salary, as an expectation that you are still 'on the clock' and will not do anything that would bring us into disrepute.""  alternatively, if a company doesn't want to go that route, and wants to do it on a reactionary basis, a severance clause could come into play.  something that says ""okay, we don't want you here, but you haven't done anything or done enough at work for us to have a reason to fire you, so we want out.  so we're going to pay you $xxx,xxx, which will be enough for you to get yourself situated in another job, or move to another location.""  whether it be upfront saying ""we expect more and we'll pay for it"" or after the fact, regardless of which it should not be free for an employer to fire someone unless workplace misconduct or one of the above rules about criminal acts can be proven.

if the job in question is one of those high-profile jobs where there's millions of dollars to be lost from a pr fiasco, these are exactly the jobs where they should be able to cut a six-figure check to have someone leave and still be able to turn to the people complaining about whatever the idiot said on social media and say ""they don't work here any more.  are you happy now?""

on a similar note, if someone is under a contract to produce work, and the contract doesn't have a per-hour morals clause, and the employer wants to sever ties, they should have to pay out as if the person under contract completed all work on the contract.  to have an easy example, roseanne barr should have been paid for all remaining episodes/seasons under contract even though her series was cancelled.

right now it's really easy for people to be okay with swarms to get people fired who say really reprehensible things, because those swarms are going after the ""right"" people.  (after all, beholdthemasterrace is doxxing, or doing the bare minimum to appear like they're not, but they do dox, and the sub should be banned for it, but it won't because who's going to go against the people that are pointing out figurative and sometimes literal nazis?)  it's easy now.  but let's look at another extreme that's constantly in reddit news.  china's new social credit system.  oh, you play video games too much, or you get caught littering or smoking?  we're revoking your right to hold certain jobs, or rent luxury hotels, or fly first-class, or even get a plane ticket at all.  by being okay with firing people for off-work behavior, that sets a precedent that you're never truly separated from your employer.  and eventually that line's going to move, and it's going to result in decisions that aren't as easy.  it's not going to go from ""let's get racists fired"" to ""let's control every aspect of someone's life for the sake of the country/employer"" like china is doing overnight, but gradually i could see where we could end up having someone get axed from a job because they posted about drinking too much, or posted a clip of them shouting ""get fucked"" when they kill someone in call of duty or something that is currently considered pretty mundane.

that's why i want to see laws that protect workers similar to what europe has, for everyone in the us.  it might protect a few assholes, but it'll probably protect way more people who aren't assholes later on.

"for buying my homeless brother a one way bus ticket to florida instead of taking him into my home (chicago area). it was my full intention to get rid of him.. hello r/aita. throwaway for what i hope are obvious reasons. 

this post is the product of years of family drama that basically all center around my brother. he was raised as the true ""golden child"" of the family, much to the detriment of my and my sister. we were a very upper middle class family and my brother was the center of the ""wrong crowd"" and his life is in absolute shambles. he is 24 now and if i had to guess, my parents have spent $500,000 on various colleges, rehab programs and facilities, actor's workshops, investment schemes and on and on. it could be a little less, it could be a lot more. the heartbreak of seeing my brother fail time after time had to be a major factor in my dad having a heart attack and dying at 63 four years ago.

my brother showed back up in chicago area last summer with a sob story about why he failed out of the last rehab my mom had paid for but this time he claimed he was ""voluntary"" homeless. my mom couldn't handle this so without checking with my or my sister, mom concocted this plan that the three of our households would ""take turns"" hosting my brother so he wouldn't have to be on the streets (my mom's new boyfriend, who is a decent guy, can't stand my brother and probably put his foot down to taking brother on full time). so when i was told about this and when my ""turn"" first came around i told my brother that in no uncertain terms that he could stay, but he had to come to work at my company, i had to be with him at all times and he had to pay his room and board through helping me with fix up our house.  he wanted no part of that and has chosen to be homeless during every two week period that he was supposed to come stay with me. i have not seen him since and since i know my mom and sister have not put a hard line on him, i know he is still using. 

well as the national news will tell you, we are in a massive deep freeze and of course this coincides with my two weeks to keep him. he showed up at my house on friday night when we started hearing just how cold it was supposed to get. i told him that he had four choices, he could avail himself of the services that the city was putting together and remain homeless, he could go back with my mom or sister, he could take me up on my offer to work and help around the house or i would buy him a bus ticket to florida to get out of the cold. 

well i don't think he caught the meaning of a one way bus ticket. what i know he thought was happening is that i was giving him a ticket to go party on the beach until the cold passed and then i would provide for him to come home. when i dropped him off at the bus station earlier in the week he point blank asked me ""when and how will you send the return ticket?""  i told him there was no return ticket, take what i was giving him or stay in the cold.  he proceeded then to unleash an angry cursed filled rant accusing me of every family sin under the sun until i kicked him out of my car. i know he got on the bus, beyond that i have no idea what happened to him and i care even less. 

edit: he absolutely knew i was giving him a one way ticket. sorry for the confusion. he just thought this was an open ended party in florida and i would be sending him a return ticket when he was ready to come home. there was no illusion or subterfuge on my part about the ticket. 


my mom is outraged at me, to the point where she is talking about suing me for ""great bodily harm"" (whatever that is supposed to mean), cutting me out of her will and estate and even telling my wife she'll introduce her to divorce attorneys. my sister has quietly thanked me because she wasn't sure how she was going to break it to my mom that she wasn't taking my brother in anymore because her fiance was sick of him. 


so from the view of my mom, i am not only an asshole, i have apparently put my brother's life in danger. 


from me and my sister's view i have washed our hand's of a long standing problem, at least for a little while. 


so, am i the asshole?


edit2: wow this is easily my biggest post ever, by a large margin. i have about 410 unread posts as of this morning. i very much will try to read all of them. 

there's one thing i just want to address really quickly. people are saying ""yta"" because i blame my dad's heart attack on my brother. surely you can say that my dad may have had a heart attack sooner or later but he died at 63 years old. other men on his side of the family have lived well into their 80s and 90s (my dad's dad is still alive as an example, my two greatgrandfathers lived to 98 and 102 as another example). there is no doubt in my mind that stress of having to deal with my brother absolutely contributed to his poor health. i am no doctor but the links between stress and heart trouble are pretty well established and it got so bad at the end that my dad's own cardiologist  was advising him that he had to let my brother go or it would kill him. my dad died after a series of small heart attacks and ""big one"" that started occurring after he went to somewhere in new mexico and rescued my brother who was prostituting himself for meth and heroin, all while my parents were sending him something like $3500 a month for living expenses to get himself ""back on track."" to me the link is so absolute that i feel 100% justified in blaming my brother for my dad's death. you can judge me all you like but the pictures of how my dad changed from a robust man in his late 30s when my brother was born to a broken shell by the time he died would maybe change your judgement.

"when i was college, i stole hundreds of dollars worth of food and snacks from one particular vending machine.. this happened many years ago. in the building that i typically went to studied in, there were 4 vending machines, 2 newish machines for drinks, one for snacks, and one very old machine for certain drinks and microwave meals. this old machine had 5 or 6 rows and each row rotated by the press of a button (with another 5 options too choose from when you rotated it). such items that this usually carried we're microwave mac n cheese, cup ramen, some pasta meals etc, for drinks it usually had yoohoo for some reason. prices for the meals were $3 and drinks were $1. anyways being a broke student and all, i usually studied for a long time in this area until i got really hungry. i would also look at these meals but end up going to another vending machine to buy 50 cent snacks. one day i got really hungry for some real food so i decided to get a mac n cheese. i put in 2 dollar bills, 2 quarters and 5 dimes to get to the $3.00. i got my food and i usually make a habit of checking the change area in the machine to see if anyone left money in it.  i reached in and took out exactly 5 dimes. this made me curious so i proceed to put another dime in the machine. the machine spits it out in the change area but it registered the money! at that moment , a light went off in my head as i realize what this means. anyways the very next time, i came back to the vending machine with about 20 dimes and proceeded to take about 7-10 items and stuffed it in to my bag. i did this for almost 3 months before maintenance came in and fixed the issue.  i proceeded to eat mac n cheese, ramen, and drank yoohoo through the rest of the semester and into summer.

"** update **i (24m) was technically raped by a girl (23f) and now she's becoming friends with my friends. original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bofs9f/i_24m_was_technically_raped_by_a_girl_23f_and_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

so it's been about a week since things happened with finding my friends with the girl who raped me. many of you helped me understand that and i took everyone's advice and recently started seeing a therapist to help, ty. 

to the people who said i deserved it or who were gatekeeping being a rape victim, i wish that you never go through what i've been dealing with. even if you're cruel you don't deserve what i've been feeling.

so i met my friends two days later. the were calling me, asking to see me. i had taken two days off sick because i just had a mental breakdown. i couldn't really function. next thing i know, i'm laying in my bed and i hear a knock on my door. when i went and opened it, it was friends a, b, and c. they came to check on me. i let them in and they demanded i told them what was going on. 

we sat on my couch and for a moment i was silent. but friend a nudged me, and i came clean. i told him how she and i had been hanging out together, how we had been drinking and i let her stay at my place to sober up, and when i said no to sex, i woke up to her riding me. 

i then explained how to try and gain control, the day after, she asked to have sex and i said yes, but what i hadn't mentioned in my post was that i couldn't get it up, i felt too horrifically gross with her, and that i instead locked myself in my restroom. saying that i was having the runs and got a lyft for her home. i cried hard. i told them how when i saw her how my stomach lurched and how i felt like yelling and so angry. how awful i felt and that's why i left, then i told them how my family had blamed me and called me a pussy for not wanting sex. 

i just vented it all in tears, and when i couldn't choke back sobbing friend a hugged me. it had been months since i had touched someone else, i couldn't bring myself to for some reason, but hugging him felt right and that's when i realized he and friends b and c were crying too.

for a moment things were weepy and friend b and c hugged me with a and just said soothing things to calm me down. they made jokes, i laughed and said sorry to them. then then told me how the night went.

so the night they hung out, and i left immediately. friend a, friend b and c questioned r (girl who raped me). she said that we had just had a negative experience on a date and that she didn't know why i would be upset. that it probably wasn't even about her. issue is friend a had seen how i was looking at her and felt weary, but apparently she's was a new coworker of his at the restaurant he works at and she had wanted to hang with him and he said yes. 

so when they start drinking and catching up on game of thrones (intended thing to do that night), they watched her pop some pills and start chugging down her beers, which were red flags immediately to my guys because she admitted herself she didn't know exactly what she was taking, and tried to get really intimate with friend a. so thing is friend a is in a relationship so he tells her no, yet she still tries to cuddle him and stuff, though he doesn't want that. 

so the episodes end and she's too out of it to drive and says she doesn't have the money for a lyft. thing is my friends have been drinking so they can't drive either so then she asks if they can let her sleep here for the night. they all agree and after b and c leave it's just a, making the couch for her to sleep.

that's when she asks to sleep with him, and he says no. so she tries again, and he refuses. so now a is pissed off, so he tells her once he's taken a nap he's taking her ass home. so he goes to his room, leaving her. he then tries to take a nap only to wake up to find r trying to get in his bed naked, and he flips. 

he was furious and called b and c, and they kicked her out of the apartment with most her clothes in hand. he then notified their boss in the morning and she was fired from her job for drug abuse. that's not the end though,

she went to the police the day after they kicked her out, and she actually filed a false rape claim against friend a, issue is when police came to question him luckily he had a camera for his room since he's always been paranoid, and now i know why. police came and he showed them the video evidence that vindicated him immediately. so now she's facing some severe penalties and issues over what she did. false police report and whatnot. 

they asked me to bring up what she did to me with the police. but honestly i don't know if i can or if bringing up something i can't prove like my friend is even worth it. what i do know is at the moment i haven't lost my friends, and i honestly don't care what happens to her. i just want to get over this. so i'll continue to go to therapy, and my friends will support me, and i'll support them. for once i don't feel like my name on here is as accurate anymore.",7
"by doing destroy dick december and actually destroying my dick.. so this happened last night into this morning. if you dont know what destroy dick december is, its when you fap/ejaculate for every day of the month for that specific date. anyway me being the fast ejaculator that i am, i actually took the challenge. i can make myself cum in under a minute the first time if i really want to and i normally do at least twice each ""session"". i am uncircumcised and could never get my skin back when i'm fully erect (will be relevant later)

i did no fap november so on the first day there was quite a load and a huge relief. everything went alright until about the 6th day where it was becoming really difficult to get myself to cum. took too long even though that i spaced it out throughout the day. but no worries i had a genius plan to solve this. make a masturbation machine for guys. you know you've seen those ones they make for the girls with a dildo strapped to a drill or something or the other. i had my idea i just needed to execute it.

on the 8th day (yesterday), i decided to take what prisoners called a ""fifi"" and improve upon it. i took a 2 liter soda bottle, cut the top 1/4 of it off and bent the rim inwards (should have bent it outwards and taped over it instead but im getting ahead of myself). i bore a hole in the cap with a screw from the inside of the cap and duct taped over it not to prevent any leaks. i then took a rubber latex glove, making sure the fingers were inside and taped it over the end of the bottle i had just cut. i pulled a few of the fingers through the actual bottle opening (where you normally pour from). then filled that baby up with some warm water and screwed it back up. i was proud of my contraption.

it was time to put her to the test. i took a drill and placed the screw in the part where you would normally put a drill bit, squirted some lotion in the glove, stuck my johnson in there and gave her a test run.it worked like a dream. i didnt have to wear my arm out spanking it anymore, i could even adjust the speed to make me cum faster. after the first session i thought i could make it better by having it fully automated instead of having to hold the trigger down. later that night when i was going for my 5th try. i got a zip tie and strapped it to the trigger and went to town. 

this try was pretty close to the last try since i woke up late that morning and had to start later. when i came i convulsed and lost all control while in orgasm, the drill still going at high speed had torn through the glove and the plastic end came in contact with my dick and sliced it right open. i was in a state of pain and pleasure.. i made a loud scream and my roommate came barging in to check on me. i dont remember the look on his face because i was in so much pain but i do remember him going ""what the fuck"" and pointing at my dick. i was bleeding badly and i can see part of my foreskin just hanging off of my penis. i was freaking the fuck out. roommate said i needed to go to the hospital but i was reluctant considering the situation. after i while i said fuck it and he drove me to the hospital.

when they finally saw me, the nurses cleaned me up and the doctors were debating over something or the other. after a few minutes they came back to me saying that because so much of my foreskin had been cut off (the right half had actually been clean cut off, probably still somewhere in my room). they thought it was best to just circumcise me and take off the rest. now a man in pain hearing that his dick will be cut off was just too much. i was flipping balls. since this post is kind of long already i'll spare all the fine details. they ended up convincing me to get the circumcision, procedure was rather short. came home with less of my dick that i had left with. had to clean up my blood bath and threw away my invention. dont  pull a macgyver like i did, old fashion way works and stick with it.

tl;dr made a masturbating machine that ended up slicing my dick and had to get circumcised.

edit: changed ""no fap december"" to ""november"". glad i decided to make a throwaway for this lol. no i didnt think i was going to make it all the way to day 31, i just wanted to see how far i can get. was hoping to make something out of it. no more fapping for me for a while anyway :/",4
"at 9 years old i filled my house with smoke and caused a small fire but my parents think it was the microwave's fault. in 3rd grade i attempted to make ramen noodles in one of those styrofoam containers where you add water. so i put the container in the microwave, filled a glass with water and put the two next to each other in the microwave, brilliant!

i set the microwave on 2 minutes and went back to the couch to watch cartoons.

came back with 10 seconds left and noticed smoke pouring out of the microwave. pulled open the door and saw the noodles completely destroyed, i took the glass of water out, threw the noodles outside and then my mom came rushing in and asked what happened. told her ""i was just making noodles"".

burnt some paint around the microwave cabinet and the house smelled like smoke for two weeks.

my parents just thought it was the microwave because it was 20+ years old.

i tried to ask an uncle speaking to me to speak mandarin, but was responded with laughter, the other relatives also seemed to enjoy my confusion. that uncle, using mandarin, told me that i am a banana who has forgotten her roots before turning back to dialect. my parents told me not to act selfishly and expect everyone to change for me. it was awkward and frustrating to be the only one in a house of strangers(yups, relatives but strangers) who had no idea what others were saying. 


since they were comfortable, i figured i might as well as make myself comfortable too. when an aunt came to speak to me again, i responded in english, this time enjoying her confused face. even though i had no idea what they were talking about, i spoke english throughout the rest of the party.


i had an earful from my parents after that, they said that i was disrespectful and a walking form of embarassment and because of me they got scolded from my grandparents for teaching me to behave this way. my sister(secretly) supported me though, saying they had what was coming for teasing me like that. aita?",3
"if i plant thorny bushes around the edge of my property to keep children away. i live close to an elementary school. every day a small parade of children walk in front of my house on their way to and from school. my girlfriend and i just finished building a small retaining wall of brick along the sidewalk and have noticed it regularly being walked/climbed on. the wall is about three feet tall.

originally we were going to plant a lot of flowering bushes along the top of it but we're pretty sure they will be destroyed slowly by the daily coming and going of the kids. we also don't want to be liable for anyone falling and getting hurt. we were at home depot to buy flowers the other day when we saw some neat looking bushes that are also a bit pokey. that's when i got the idea to use them as a deterrent. so, will i be the asshole if i plant them along the top of the wall?

**thank you for the different plant suggestions! keep em comin! i live in a zone 7 climate.

** there seems to be a minority rising that think i'm out to fuck these kids over and that is very much not the case. i just don't want them climbing all over the wall, which is already happening. i used the term ""pokey bushes"" intentionally as i just want a *deterrent*. something that is more scary than damaging but will be effective if they actually try anyway. (lol, the people suggesting cholla catus!)

**due to demand, i'll try to post pictures when it's done. weather permitting and plant availability it should hopefully be done by wednesday.

\*\*here are the pictures of before and after.(https://imgur.com/a/llp70u9) sorry they're a little late; it was just my gf and i working on it. the pictures aren't super great and unfortunately, the plants are still quite small as they have just been planted. we're also not done landscaping this portion. need more fabric to stop weeds and we are going to put something over it(mulch or my gf wants some small black rocks). as for the pokey plants, the plant nearest to the camera is *wild rose* and following the wall we planted a few *lantana*. both of which should grow out over the wall in the next two years or so. behind those we have some random white flowers, some salvia and lavender. we then planted a little fig tree and two lilacs on either side of the front door. in the background to the right we planted a jasmine to grow alone the fence. if someone wants to remind me, i can take pictures again next year for some plant growth progress.",3
"if a rectangular magnetic ""plate"" has an object hovering over it, and i pick up the plate, do i feel the weight of both or only the magnet plate?. so this is a project i saw in a conference today, and with my limited knowledge of high school physics i thought this felt completely bullshit.
the idea was a backpack with magnets that carry the stuff inside it so you don't have to.
but according to newton's first law, isn't the person carrying the backpack still feeling the weight of what's inside + the weight of the magnets?

edit: so this blew up way more than i expected, i was just asking a regular question so let's clarify some points:

1- the goal of the course was not marketing a product, but creating an innovating and realisable product, and hopefully, encourage the winners to pursue the idea by starting a business later.
2- as many have pointed out this could have the good effect of diminishing pressure on the back by acting like a suspension when books are kinda moving when you are walking, but this wasn't what they wanted it to be, not that it really matters, but just to make it clear for people that are asking.",9
"update i think my mom is going to try to kill my grandmother and make it look like suicide.. i wanted to thank the r/legaladvice community and give an update to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9sudc9/i_think_my_mom_is_going_to_try_to_kill_my/) from about 4 months ago. for privacy purposes as this is an ongoing situation, this post will be fairly short and vague.

last month my grandmother was admitted to the icu in respiratory failure. she pulled through, but with the help of my aunts, uncles and cousins we determined (with evidence) that my mom has been both neglecting my grandmother's medical needs and drugging my grandmother without her knowledge. although she wouldn't outright say it to me, it turns out that my mother had been insisting to my cousins that my grandmother was suicidal, and even tried to keep pushing the 'she wants to kill herself' narrative while my grandmother was hospitalized. we believe that she may have even attempted to od my grandmother at the hospital, but her plan was thwarted by ever-present relatives. as an aside, we did alert the hospital of the situation and unfortunately were told they couldn't do anything because ""it's a family matter"". everything is now in the hands of my aunt, who's working with a lawyer to address the situation in the least stressful way for my grandmother. thank you all for your advice and support on my last post, and i'm so glad that my grandmother is still with us. i truly believed that this situation would only end in tragedy, but it seems fate had different plans. my grandmother is still in the care of my mother for the moment (with relatives checking in daily), and while my mother is not yet aware that my family knows of *everything* she's been doing, she does at least know that her siblings are seeking to change the poa and insurance benefits out of her name, and has since completely changed her tune about my grandmother's mental health. otherwise, my grandmother is home and doing well, and is under the close eye of her children, doctors and social worker while my family works out where to go from here. thank you all again.

"teachers don't like wikipedia because it's easy and available.. i'm sorry if this is voiced a lot here, but i had an epiphany today when i saw that in a teacher's citation, different wikipedia articles were all cited. i hate how teachers and professors dismiss wikipedia as a source because ""anybody can change it"". i've rarely ever seen substantial evidence of mass inaccurate information on the site. it's so convenient because it's a compilation of all different kinds of information about something edited by different people with different perspectives. i get that it trivializes the ""research experience"" but when are we realistically going to need that if wikipedia exists?

"by pulling my butt plug off the wall and ripping the entire tile off with it a day before rent inspection. nsfw.. here it is (https://imgur.com/gallery/mjd8plc)

i wash and stick it to the tiled wall in our bathroom to dry because it's handy and it makes me laugh every time i walk into the bathroom. we have a rent inspection tomorrow so i pulled it off the wall to put it away and managed to rip the entire tile off the wall with it. i've propped the tile back against the wall as best as i could and have shoved a plant pot in front of it to try and hide it. worst part is my dad is a carpenter and i'm going to ask him to fix it but i don't know how i'm supposed to explain how the tile fell off. 

""hey dad i pulled my butt plug off the wall and ripped the entire tile off in the process lmao"" 

tl;dr i pulled my butt plug off the wall and ripped the tile off with it a day before rent inspection.

**edit** 
i know it's an easy fix to put a tile back on the wall, we just attached it back on temporarily - but i want it done properly (sealed and all) so i don't lose my bond when my lease is up. partner isn't a tradie. dad is. dad costs less than paying someone to come properly fix it 🤷🏼‍♀️",4
"my husband's ex-wife took my stepson to the dermatologist and told them to send the bill to us (without, of course, mentioning it to us). shockingly, they did and are now hounding us to pay for services we never authorized or even knew about until after the fact. in montana.. as the title describes, my stepson's mother took him to the dermatologist. the treatment he underwent was not medically necessary, but i'm glad he had the appointment regardless. that's not the point. 

the issue is that several months after the fact, my husband and i recieved a letter stating we were past due and owed the office several hundred dollars for the kiddo. this was doubly confusing, as my husband has used this doctor himself and they're a pay at time of service operation. i called and the office manager said the ex had said to just bill it to my husband. i advised her that, obviously, the ex wife is not able to speak for us financially, so what the heck?? 

her response was that the insurance they had on file (from my husband's visit there three or four years ago) was under hubby's name so they thought it would be okay. i advised her that, first of all, the policy she was referring to had been canceled years ago and that the family has been under my company policy for over two years now. and second, billing an insurance company is a little different than sending an individual a bill without any sort of communication much less permission.

she told me i'd have to come into the office and update my stepson's insurance information and pay the bill and then they would submit it to insurance to reimburse me. i told her that the divorce agreement states that my husband pays the insurance premiums, but deductibles or costs for medically necessary procedures, emergency visits etc. are split 50/50. non essential services are at the discretion of the individual parent, and we hadn't given permission for any of this. and frankly, i shouldn't have to be explaining this to her because she should know better than to send bills to people who aren't even in the office or in communication with the doctor. 

the office manager proceeded to tell me that ""it wasn't fair"" to charge the ex and then submit to insurance for reimbursement (this office doesn't collect from insurance, apparently, they submit for insurance to pay the policy holder back after the bill is paid) because the insurance company would send the check to me and i might just keep it. i told her that's wildly insulting to suggest and, frankly,  none of her business anyway. she's not in a position to dictate how we handle the financial specifics of the divorce. 

she repeatedly insisted my husband and i are liable for this bill, so before i head to the office and handle this in person, i wanted some advice. does the doctor's office have a leg to stand on here? i just don't understand how a person who is not authorized to speak or spend on our behalf can just tell a business to send us an invoice?",2
"for threatening to sue my parents for taking out student loans in my name?. i graduated college 4 years ago and i rarely speak to my mother or father. maybe 2-3 times a year and even then it's only for a few minutes, they refused to let me play sports in high school or have a social life and they've basically cut me out of their lives since i and about 75 other people got a city drinking ticket 7 years ago in college. since i live about 800 miles away, i only go back to my hometown once a year either for thanksgiving or christmas, most years i stay with a friend or at a hotel, last year i stayed with my parents. no way in hell am i going back for either this year.

just about 5 months before i graduated college, my parents bought a boat. i know they got a good deal on it and they have used it a lot. they took it out of the water for the season in early october. i've literally never seen it in person, just pictures from facebook.

last week i had texted my father (first contact since march) and let him know i would be able to make it back for christmas. about a minute later he called and over the course of 5 minutes explained how he and my mother decided since their last child was about through college, they would buy a boat. the only problem was they didn't have the ~$20,000 to buy it.

what was their solution? take out a student loan in my name of course! my mailing address was always their house through college so i was none the wiser. why was my dad telling me about it now 4 years after the fact? because they can't pay it back, they actually never paid any of it back. they kept putting it in forbearance but that ran out early this year. fast forward 7 or 8 missed payments later and my dad tells me the only reason he's telling me now is because he doesn't want me to bring it up at christmas and he knows it's going to default in a month or two. his exact words were ""if you're going to make a big deal about this it's best if you don't come home this year"".

he also said it's ""about $25,000"" is what i would need to pay it off. i hung up and just sat in shock for a couple of minutes. i called my brother yesterday and told him what was happening and that i think i'm going to sue them for whatever it takes to pay off the loan. i still don't know what that amount is yet, i should probably find out by next week. i'm cool with my brother and he's cool with my parents and i'm sure he probably talked to them because this morning i get a text from my mom just saying ""do not sue us"". i texted her back saying she would need to immediately pay off the entire loan and show me proof. she texts back that i need to grow up. obviously i'm not even going to respond to that.

the boat is probably worth half of what they paid for it by now and with the hours they've put on it. i don't know if they have the money or not to pay up immediately if i sue them but i figure i can at least garnish their wages. my other brother called and asked me to hold off a few months before doing anything that it was shitty of them to do that but to give them a chance to start paying if off.

"its my birthday and i have a story. so hey. ive never posted on here but i'll do my best not to sound like a weenie. so im turning 24 today, not important, but it has been almost 6 years since a guy in my high school committed suicide. it is important that i didnt say friend because i honestly hardly knew him. we had one class together, gym, and we didnt really talk much. we were friendly with each other and knew each others names but that is about it. one day he helped me find a ring i dropped in gym and that was the most interaction we ever had. his name was cal r. obviously i wouldnt feel right saying his full name here but to this day i still remember him. i remember how he would dye his hair every few months. i remember how he would try half heartedly in gym. i remember how his parents accepted his diploma only a few weeks after his funeral. i remember the kids getting arrested because they spray painted ""remember cal"" under the bridge where he committed suicide. so i dont really know anything about him, what his home life was like, or why he did what he did. but i remember him, and i most likely always will. i'll remember his quick ""hey"" and ""how are ya"" in the hall or at lunch. i'll remember how excited he was to have found my ring. for whatever reason it really seemed to make him happy. what i'm trying to say i guess is. well i dont know what i'm trying to say. all i know is that he is gone forever and i'm sure a lot of people miss him. i hardly knew him and i miss him, the very fact that he isnt here makes me sad. so, i'll always remember cal and if you are in a place like that. people will remember you. no matter how alone or unwanted or anything negative you may feel. i guarantee someone will miss you. shit, if you say hi to me and tell me your name, i'll fucking remember you. so. please. keep trying, keep fighting even if it sucks. there are people, even if you dont quite know it, who will miss you. who will stop everything they are doing during the day and just. remember you, what you were like, what you could have become. so. as a certain character says ""keep struggling"" you can do it. i believe in you. and even if i dont know you, as a fellow human who knows what its like, i fucking love you. 

edit 1: okay i figured out that simply editing the thing is better than writing a random comment. im trying to get to as many comments as i can. i will definitely be responding to more tomorrow but i think its time for bed for me. but i want to thank everyone for making this a very memorable birthday. all of your stories has really touched my heart. so while i will be back tomorrow to talk and try to help anyone who needs it tomorrow i want to. i dont know leave a message now that i feel i have a platform. no matter how small an act or gesture, it can change the course of someones life whether you know it or not. so if you think something as simple as buying someone a candy bar at work is going to be pointless. it might make them feel wanted and thought about. so just. i dont know. spread love this month i guess. i'll be back tomorrow!

"how does a $21,000 car minus $5,500 equal $30,600?. today i went to go buy a car i have been looking at for a while. it was listed at $21,000 and they offered me $5,500 for my trade so that would have made the cost $15,500... right?
well they go about doing the numbers with the good cop bad cop scheme with the manager and come back to me with $425 a month for 72 months. i totaled that up and it was $30,600 and i'm like... what the hell. i asked them what the interest rate was 3 times and they looked at me like i was the dumb one. granted i am a 24 year old woman, i know what an interest rate is. 
can someone check my math here, did they just try to offer me a 100% interest rate almost??
i stood up and walked out of there without giving them another word. they have been texting and calling me but i am so appalled.

thank you for everyone who gave me good solid advice. as for the people saying i should keep my car, i cant. it's a 2013 ford focus and the transmission is shot. ford says there isn't anything wrong with it. there is currently a class action against them. 
i don't know why my credit is low. i paid off my last car with no late payments at all. i have a couple credit cards that i pay on and have never been late and some hospital bills that i refuse to pay. so i don't know.

and to all of the rude people going through my comment history and harassing me, go find something else to do. 
sorry for going missing, i had to be up at 5am to work!

some of these comments are making me feel like straight shit though. in my part of the country we don't make a lot of money. i'm a college educated certified cpht not a fucking fast food worker. ",10

"pa i was just fired for refusing to give vaccinations as a receptionist. i am certified in pa as a cmaa (certified medical administrative assistant) and my boss knows this. my official job title on hire was ""medical receptionist"".

she started pushing me recently to do height and weight because the office is under-staffed. she pushed another receptionist into calling in medication which i found out is illegal in the state. i refused to do this.

she became angry with me and her tone changed about a month ago. 

when she demanded i start doing flu shots, i declined. i was sick last week and had to call off. she called me in this morning and asked why i refused to do the vaccinations. i told her i am not certified and she fired me on the spot stating i ""miss too much work"".

i am only concerned about moving on at this point and concerned about uc. i heard she has done this to other receptionists and made sure they did not get paid their final pay and did not collect unemployment when the dispute letter arrived. one girl even sued this woman and won. she is the office manager for a foreign doctor.

"for not giving up my table (at a restaurant) for a pregnant woman who needed it for accessibility?. two nights ago i was out for dinner with my husband at this new restaurant we've been wanting to try for a while. it's got a michelin star so it's always packed and the restaurant itself is pretty tiny and spans two floors. 

we got a great table on the first floor which is really just a bar, some tiny two person tables, and those standing tables for drinks. we essentially got the only table by the window for actual dining. we got this due to calling nearly a week ahead for reservations. 

anyways nearly half an hour into our meal this visibly pregnant woman and her husband comes in asking for a table. they had a reservation but no request for any specific table so when the hostess starts leading them upstairs to the main dining room the woman says no, she can't go up stairs in her current state (she looks very pregnant). 

long story short, they end up approaching us asking if we'd mind switching tables with them so they could have our ground floor table. my husband is like ok i guess but i simply said no, i called ahead to get this exact table and i want to stay here. the hostess shrugs and the woman and her husband looks pretty ticked off. she rolled her eyes at me and they just left. my husband thinks we should've given up our table. aita?

**edit**: to everyone asking for more details, here's a better breakdown of what happened. 

we had just gotten our starters and were still anticipating 3 more courses (pasta/main/dessert). we had also ordered an expensive bottle of wine so had no intention to rush the evening. the table i reserved was a bit special because it was the only one set in these huge bay windows that's very iconic to this particular restaurant, looks very romantic basically. i had called previously just to ask for this table and was turned down (original date was last weekend but table was taken) but we went midweek instead since we weren't in any rush and thought that window table was especially nice. also the upstairs dining room is sort of grim compared to downstairs (smaller windows, used to be the attic). 

when the other couple came in we didn't notice initially until they started whispering to each other and the hostess while staring at us. eventually the hostess comes over with them in tow asking if we'd switch tables and they'd comp our starters. the pregnant woman tells us they drove over an hour to get here to eat and she can't walk up stairs because of her knees (it was some medical condition i can't remember). my husband and i talked it over and i said no thank you we'd like the stay here if possible. honestly i didn't expect them to just leave the restaurant. i assumed they would make do and just eat at the other smaller bar tables on the ground floor since they were mostly empty at this time.

this is where the couple kind of huffs collectively and the guy said ""seriously?"" under his breath and the woman very exaggeratedly rolled her eyes. i'm like ""whatever"" at this point and we go back to our meal. some waiters come over and offer to piece together some of the smaller bar tables on the ground floor into one large table but i guess they didn't want that (we weren't close enough to hear why). finally our waitress and hostess comes over (couple waits by door) asking if we can finish in ~30 minutes if they rush our order and bring all the food out at once. my husband and i are like ""obviously not we're not going to glug our wine and inhale our food"" and they relent and go tell the couple we're not moving. then the couple leaves.

actually, looking back now it's possible that couple knew people at this restaurant since the hostess/waiters seemed exceptionally frantic when they couldn't get our table and kept apologizing. i remember being kind of annoyed they were acting like that when they basically wanted to kick us out minutes earlier. could be speculation but i wouldn't be surprised if they were important somehow and the restaurant didn't want to piss them off.",3

"for using the word ""miscarry"" to beat my wife in scrabble?. for context, my wife and i have always been extremely competitive. it's an important part of our relationship, and she has gotten pissed at me in the past when she perceives i have thrown a game intentionally to spare her the sadness of losing. 

tonight as we were playing scrabble, i had the option to play the word ""miscarry"" to win the game. from what i could tell, there were no other words i could've played that would have resulted in me winning.

sadly, a few months she had a miscarriage. it is still a sensitive topic. i chose to play the word, and she was super upset and hurt since i had the option to play the word. she is currently not speaking to me cause i failed to immediately apologize.

"i received a bill from my old dentist for services from 2014. i found proof i paid, now they won't answer the phone.. in 2014 for a period of 4 months i did a teeth whiting treatment. it was expensive, around $750, but i was getting married in 2015 and it was worth it to me. i paid each of the 3 visits in full before leaving the dentist.

years earlier at a minute clinic, i had an issue because the office told me the services were covered by my insurance, which was a mistake. i got a bill 6 months later for the treatment which i barely remembered having. ever since then i have never left a doctor's appointment, dentist, or anything else without making a full payment for whatever services were performed.

so the treatment concluded at the end of 2014 and i leave for another dentist. fast forward to the middle of 2015 and i received a bill for a past due payment of $239 dollars. i called the office twice and left 2 voicemails. in the second voicemail i said i think the bill is a mistake, if you need any help clearing it up please call me.

fast forward to yesterday. some of my old mail goes to my parents home and i picked up yesterday. in the bundle was a bill from a different dentist for $239 with a handwritten note saying ""your immediate attention is required"". 

so i called them this morning and it turns out the dentist changed names and locations. after clarifying that i told them it isn't possible to have a balance, i paid each visit in full before leaving. the woman on the phone said that the whiting wasn't covered by insurance, and i only paid $500 of the $739. i said again, that isn't possible, i paid every visit in full.

she told me that i need to prove to her i made the payments and she would apologize and fix my account. i asked her when my last visit was and she couldn't tell me ""she didn't have that information"". she rushed me off the phone and told me she would call me back when she wasn't so busy.

i save my old bank statements and was able to dig up the ones from 9/14,10/14, and 12/14 which show me making payments of $239, $250, and $239. 

with proof i called them back and they didn't answer. i called back again and left a voicemail. i called back again and it made the noise like a fax machine. any other office and i wouldn't have a problem but this office has done this before with not answering the phone. i don't want to get a call from collections saying i owe them money in a few months time. my wife and i are looking to buy a home soon so my credit score can't take a hit because of this foolishness. they are only 30 minutes away. should i drive to them and speak to them in person? what would happen if they send me to collections? even though i am in the right could it negatively impact my credit?

tl;dr i paid for the dentist in full, 3 separate payments. dentist doesn't have record of one of the payments and has sent me bills for the services performed in 2014. my bank statements prove i made all the payments. i keep calling them and they won't answer.


**edit:** thanks for all of your responses! i have off from work tomorrow so i will be going in to the office in person. 


**edit 2:** thanks for all the advice and feedback. also thank you for the pm's telling me i couldn't count. i did make a mistake in my initial post, my payments were $250, $250, and $239, those 3 payments along with an $11 bill credit from a previous over-payment totaled the $750 procedure. 


i drove to the new dentist today and the office was really nice, but it smelled like burger king. i had no idea why, but it didn't matter to me because i just wanted this done. i brought with me my account statements from september, october, and december of 2014. the woman at the front desk tried to make copies of them and i stopped her. the paperwork had my account number and i wasn't letting her copy that. 

i had them print out a full account summary of all services and payments during my entire run with the dentist. i then requested a print out of the final bill, totaling $0.00 owed. after she bit into her burger, she printed the bill for me confirming that i now owe them nothing and their system has been updated.

so, there are really two victories here. i get to wash my hands of them with proof i owe them nothing, and i found out why a dentist would smell like burgers.

"for forcing a 6 year old kid to be separated from her parent on a flight?. title kinda sounds fucked up but hear me out lol

i recently was on an international flight and i always try to snag the window seat so i can sleep. a woman was seated next to me and asked if i could give up my seat since it turned out that her 6 year old was apparently seated in the row across. i tried to be nice about it and said, ""sorry, but i specifically chose this seat and i don't really want to give it up, i've been traveling for hours.""

the woman's response was, ""well so have we! imagine traveling with an overtired kindergartener who now won't be able to sleep since she can't sit by her mom!"" she made me look like an asshole in front of the other people on the flight, and i felt bad since it was a little kid. i agree that it probably sucks to be traveling with a little kid, but for not giving up my seat?

edit:

1. i was seated in the window seat, the woman was in the middle seat next to me, and another passenger was in the aisle seat next to her. 6 year old kid was across in the next row over in the aisle seat. since the mother and the kid were only one seat away from each other, it wasn't so much an issue of not being seated next to each other, but more that the mom wanted her kid to have the window seat so she could sleep
2. this wasn't an issue of separation and the kid being scared. her mom was one seat away. this was an issue of wanting the seat for her kid just so she could sleep
3. for those asking duration of the flight: 6 hours
4. for those asking ""why didn't she ask the other person in the aisle seat?"" because she specifically wanted the window seat for her child",3

"for sleeping on the floor?. i'm a very tall woman.

i'm about 6'5. it's difficult but i manage. i'm out of town right now visiting my brother, his wife and their kids. my sil is a kind of neurotic, tense person, a perfectionist, and she and i have never gotten along, but we're polite and civil for my big brother's sake. plus, i love my nieces, so being nice to her is just carte blanche.

they have a small house so while i'm here they've had the younger daughter share a bed with the older one, giving me the five year old's bed. i knew right away that the little bed was gonna be waaaaaay too short but after my seven hour drive i just wanted some sleep. my feet stuck off the end a good foot and a half.

the next night i just took the pillow and blanket and slept on the floor next to the bed. there was a rug so it wasn't too bad but definitely not the best. the next day i waited until everyone was asleep and went out to the sofa. i was still too tall but it was better than the floor. next day sil asked me not to sleep on the sofa via text message after she went to work. that night i slept on the floor again and the next morning sil came in to see if i wanted breakfast and found me sleeping there.

it became this huge thing and culminated with me leaving to stay in the only hotel in the small town they live in, which is a thirty minute drive from their ranch. now my brother and sil are pissed at me, the nieces are sad that i'm not sleeping over. for sleeping on the floor or should i have just sucked it up?",3

"former grad student, considering suing my university for $14k unpaid wages (texas). long story short, i completed my graduate degree back in december and my graduate advisor still owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages for the work i did in their research lab during my last year of grad school. this professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. the excuses for why i wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as i was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when i tried to talk to them. during the year where i wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. they lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me ""hey, i thought you should know this is what dr. professor said about you, and i know that's not true"".

i contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. i gave legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where i was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, i did, and then they did nothing. i informed them that this professor has done this to at least three other students over the course of at least five years. one of the other students had to drop out because, unlike me, they didn't have any external funding. i gave them piles of documentation, much of it taken from the university's own records, showing how the professor had falsified financial statements, employment records, grant proposals and reports, how the professor was paying students less than promised or nothing at all and using personnel money to buy equipment because they intentionally underestimated their equipment costs to make their grant proposal seem more competitive. university legal still did nothing. i contacted them again to ask if they needed any additional information from me, if they had planned or taken any corrective action, if they were planning on paying me my wages, no response of any kind.

granted, they have been busy the past few weeks with coaches taking bribes from celebrities, but i spoke to them months before that. as far as i know, at this point my only option is to just sue the university directly. they have a massive legal department and they've argued in front of scotus multiple times in the past few years, so i have no idea if or how i should approach this, but the simple fact of the matter is that this professor owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages, i have written statements promising me that amount, they slandered me in professional settings, and they're lying to the university and the federal government about how they're using research funds. what are the odds of suing a top-tier public research university with a multi-billion-dollar endowment and coming out ahead?  i'm in texas if that's relevant.",2

"equifax is refusing to remove my father's bankruptcy from my credit report. any advice?. i will try to make this quick. my father and i both have the same name, except my parents added the jr. suffix to my official title. my father does not use a suffix. neither of us have middle names. my father filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2016 after he became permanently disabled. in may 2018, equifax reports to have received notification of a bankruptcy and has mistakenly applied the public record to my credit report as well.

now is where the fun begins.

i file a dispute with equifax in 2018 after the bankruptcy appears on my credit report. they close the dispute and have determined that the bankruptcy has been correctly assigned to my report. oh jesus, here we go.

i call equifax again and i'm told that the jr. suffix does not exist in their records and i will need to send correspondence with an official cover letter and pertinent official documents (birth cert, ss card, license, utility bill, etc.) asking them to add the official jr. suffix that is on all of my documents since birth.

after a week, i call equifax again. they claim that my address on the fax that i sent them was illegible and they cannot complete the request. great, now i need to re-do all of this because their printer is out of toner.

equifax also tells me on this phonecall that they can see the bankruptcy is filed under my father and has also been applied to my credit report. but the woman i spoke with cannot do anything about it other than file another dispute, which she doesn't review, and will not disclose to me who reviews it. she advised me to contact the united states bankruptcy court to obtain a letter stating that the bankruptcy is my father's and not mine.

so i call. they don't provide, and have never provided, such a letter to anyone. i am then advised to enter the court records and purchase copies of anything that could maybe help me.

i am currently writing 2 cover letters. one for the jr. suffix addition, and one for the incorrectly assigned bankruptcy. i have printed out anything from the court records that shows my fathers ssn and his name on the same page because i cannot trust equifax to do any investigation of their own. i will be sending these packages by certified mail this time, and not fax.

mommy why is there poop in your panties? oh no what happened?!

i've never told anyone about this. at the time i was afraid that i would get in trouble so i didn't tell my mom and since then i haven't really had the opportunity to tell anyone. i wish i would have talked to him. asked him what was wrong and told him that everything was going to be okay. i know that it's not my fault but i will never get over the fact that i could have done something.

"i'm not being allowed to make payment on a loan i cosigned. in a past life i cosigned a car loan with my now ex-wife.  we got divorced, she was to assume responsibility for the loan.

fast forward a few years and the loan is almost paid off, down to about $300.  i started noticing a few months ago that she was missing the payment deadline, earning some late fees, but ultimately making payments.  i called the bank and verified that they wouldn't report late payments on my credit report unless the late payment was delinquent for 30 days.  so i started watching the loan like a hawk, with the intention of stepping in if a payment ever ran the risk of running over that threshold.

yesterday i saw that it didn't look like my ex was going to make a payment within that 30 day threshold, so i called up the bank to make a payment and was told that due to a situation they were having with my ex--that they could not disclose with me--they would not accept any payments against the loan!

i'm at a loss of how to proceed.  i thought the whole point of cosigning a loan was that i was to be responsible to make payment if the primary loan holder could not, but now they won't let me, and they said they're still going to report the loan to my credit for nonpayment.

i'm kicking myself because maybe i should have made payment as soon as it was late, rather than waiting until it was closer to the 30 days, but i didn't want to do my ex any favors.    i have no contact with her, she has purged all her social media over the last couple years and changed her phone number, i don't even know where she lives, so reaching out to her to figure out what's going on is going to be a problem.

at this point, having made all the mistakes i've made already, how would you proceed in this situation?


edit: i just spoke to someone at the bank and it turns out my ex's checking account and savings accounts are in the red, so they won't let her make payments on her car until she's rectified that situation. so now i'm climbing the supervisor ladder making my case that this shouldn't prevent me from satisfying my obligation to the debt, as that was the whole point of having me cosign on the loan to begin with.

edit2: thank you, everyone.  i finally got someone high enough on the ladder to be authorized to use common sense and they apologized profusely and allowed me to pay off the loan over the phone.  i requested they send me a receipt as i don't trust that this is really done until i have paper saying i'm off the hook, but i feel one step closer.",10

edit five: final edit.

you are not racist if you do not like illegal immigrants.

to preface this: i won't delete my post to hide it with the better written one, i am not a politician. i am third generation irish-american and whatever generation arab-american. i do speak spanish as a second language but it's not something i am forthcoming with because i do not speak it as well as i used to. 

i misspoke when i said i hate the person themselves. i disagree with the concept of illegal immigration. i did not mean to pander to hate and i will not pander to hate. i apologise for using strong language but not for my opinion. i am for legal immigration, but that is not the issue at hand.

you are not racist if you don't like illegal immigrants. but you must support immigration reformation to make legal immigration easier, for everyone. you are not racist if you support deportation for illegal immigrants. i think we should use the justice system to punish those who exploit illegal immigrants enticing them to come here. this is a racially charged argument but it is not about race or where they came from, it's about respecting the laws of the country you are coming to hoping to establish a better life in. every country on earth has immigration laws that we must respect even if we do not agree with them.

the issue with illegal immigration is that we cannot allocate the resources to reform immigration when those resources are needed to stop illegal immigrants from coming here unsafely.

the main point i came back to say is, you're not racist if you dislike illegal immigration. the people who bring up race with this argument are the ones who need introspection on their personal belief because if you hear illegal immigrant and think brown person you expose your own bias.",6

it doesn't matter if both of your parents landed in the usa the day before you were born, and carried on their home traditions in their new home, you are american-american.

if your american dad meets an italian woman whilst on holiday, and you have equal cultural input from both sides growing up, then sure, call yourself american-italian, but that's where the buck stops. this is how my cousins were raised, even splitting school between 2 countries, but they have never referred to themselves as british-chilean, why? because it's fucking stupid.",6

"confession: i had a sexual relationship with my stepsister, got her pregnant and paid for the abortion. nsfw. in high school my stepsister and i constantly found ourselves with a lot of idle time alone together.  we'd come home from school and it would just be us for a few hours.  both of our parents (her dad, my mom) traveled a lot, so we often had the house to ourselves on the weekends. we'd throw parties, have friends over.  for the most part we got along.  
  
late one night following al party, she came into my room just as i was getting into bed and asked if she could sleep on the floor.  a friend of hers had gotten wicked drunk, puked, and passed out in her bed.  there were people sleeping on the couches and in the guest room.  she had no place else to sleep.  i offered to give her my bed and sleep on the floor.  she told me to move over and crawled into bed with me.
  
we talked for a little while, laughing about the events of the evening, and smoked a bowl.  both of us had struck out with our respective crushes; they actually ended up hooking up and leaving together.   i was making fun of her crush, because he was a fucking tool, and she made fun of mine for being a ""superficial cunt.""  
  
at one point she dropped the pipe as i was passing it back to her, ashes spilled all over the sheets.  she got up and wiped them off while i teased her for being clumsy.  she was wearing a t-shirt and these hot little pajama pants that made her apple ass look great.  she got back in bed, i packed another bowl.  she was moving around, trying to get comfortable, when she slapped the sheets back.  i had a raging hardon tenting in my boxers.  
  
she giggled and laughed at first, then she made a comment about my size.  she flicked it, playfully.  it responded.  
  
""it's not you,"" i said.  
  
""i know.""  
  
(it was.)  
  

she turned away from me, curled up a little.  her ass was hanging out of her pajama pants and pointing at me.  every time one of us shifted, we slowly moved closer to each other.  
  
after a minute or so of silence she said, ""we could do stuff.""  
  
""we could,"" i said.  ""but we shouldn't.""  
  
""should we?""  
  
""probably not.""  

  
by this point i was almost touching her butt.  she moved and felt me.  ""we're not blood,"" she said.  
  
we talked about it a bit, about how we *could* do stuff, some stuff, and how we shouldn't do some other stuff.  
  
""no sex,"" she said.  ""just fun stuff.""  
  
""and no kissing,"" i said.  ""that would be too weird.  
  
we had established the rules.  she was practically grinding her butt against me.  
  
she turned and grabbed me, pulled me out of my boxers, and started playing with me.  she was a little rough (we were both pretty inexperienced) and was doing it all wrong.  i tried to correct her and that's when she said she wanted to watch me.  i said i wanted to watch her.  so we watched each other.  
  
we didn't cuddle or anything after and she was gone by the time i woke up the next morning.  i didn't see her all day.  
  
that night, after all of our friends had gone, she came home and found me swimming me in the pool.  we talked for a few minutes, but not about the night before.  she went inside, said she'd be up in her room doing stuff.  there was a look she gave that i would come to know.  
  
that night we went down on each other and 69'd, and that was what we mostly did every now and then.  at first only when our parents were gone, but then it became more frequent, eventually it was almost every day after school.  
  
the first time we had sex was an accident.  she was giving me a massage on my bed and when i flipped so she could work my front, i was tenting like mad.  she teased me with her butt at first, and kept sliding back and forth across my body.  i was poking out of my boxers and just kinda slipped in.  
  
she asked if she should stop.  

i said she should.  
  
she asked if i wanted her to stop.  
  
i said no.  
  

  
from there sex became as regular as oral.  there was a period of about two weeks where we fucked every day.  that was when we started kissing and sleeping in the same bed.  
  
that was when she got pregnant.  
  
she didn't tell me at first.  i noticed something was different about her.  she was getting fucked up almost every day.  she denied it, but i think she was trying to miscarry.  
  
once she told me i offered to do whatever she wanted.  she asked for the money, which i gave without hesitation.  her friend took her to the clinic (she told her it was some random guy she had hooked up with).  
  
we stopped fooling around after that.  things were only awkward for like a week or so before we got back to our original stepbrother/stepsister relationship.  i started dating a girl she didn't like.  so she dated a guy i didn't like.  we were passive aggressively trying to make each other jealous.  
  
we're both dating someone the other doesn't like now.  we only see each other a few times a year, but when we do we're careful, take precautions.  she's on the pill, i usually pull out.  unless she doesn't want me to.

"years ago, when we were teenagers, one of my cousins who i only see once a year, made fun of someone going bald due to chemotherapy treatment. i replaced her shampoo with hair removing lotion.. my cousin is the family princess, and also the most fragile spoiled crybaby i've ever met. so if i talked to her about it, she would twist what i said and tell her family that i was verbally abusive (like i used to be whenever she did something fucked up.(my bad, still not sorry)) and it would ruin my relationship with that side of the family. 

sorry for wasting your time trying to sue the shampoo and conditioner company. it wasn't there falut, that was just me being passive aggressive.  i love you cousin :) ",12
"by overestimating my tolerance to weed by a longshot.. tl;dr i took too many edibles, tripped out.

obligatory it was yesterday yadda yadda yadda.

so to start off i would like to say that i smoke weed about 3-4 times a week. i smoke maybe a gram, or more with friends. i have never smoked so much that i lost control of myself, or couldn't function. i have never thrown up from smoking too much, so i would like to consider myself a heavy weight. however, i had never tried edibles.

i decided to make some at home, because i like cooking, and i decided to make an omelet with canabutter. the recipe said around 4 grams of high thc concentrated grams of weed. i grow my own, and pride myself on a cannabis plant with high thc content, but 4 grams for 1 whole cup of butter and half a cup of water?!?!? that seemed absurd, and i was eating w a friend, so i used 4 grams for 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of water, thinking i will just be careful with dosing. i invited a, as in one, friend over, (let's call him jason)and we made the omelet. i added about 2 tablespoons of the cannabutter, blended and cooked for a long amount of time i might add, or approximately half into the actual egg mixture (4 eggs and a couple table spoons of sour cream w some spices). i then added a very little bit to melt on the pan, but i thought it couldn't hurt so i added more. also, the whole time i was thinking my friend would help me finish it.

i made the omelet, we dug in, and then we quickly drove to a nearby chili's because we knew they were strong, and we didn't want to drive under the influence. i got there, and barely ordered our water when everything hit me all at once. i felt like the air became corn syrup. the waitress was standing right next to me, and then i blinked, and i swear on my mother she just teleported to the other side of the table. my friend was obviously also high as a kite. it's hard to explain how high i was, and then i played some games on the little ipad they had. i sat there, and i kept thinking about how i had to say something or else it would be awkward. then i started freaking out when one of my other friends got here(i'll go with clarissa), i had invited her prior but she does not partake in weed. i forgot my jason was there, because in my mind i only had one friend sitting down w me at chili's. then i turned an saw my jason, and he was just smiling. he said he felt like there were hooks in his cheeks holding his smile up, but it felt good. i asked clarissa whether or not she felt as if the service was taking forever, but she told me she just sat down. i felt like she was gaslighting me, because i could have sworn we were there for like a  couple hours. i said i needed to take a piss, so i started walking to the bathrooms. that is when i walked into the girl's restroom. luckily nobody was there, but i was so confused until i realized it was the women's restroom due to the lack of urinals. after washing my hands in what felt like water so hot it was freezing cold i went back to my table. as i sat down, both of my friends were gone. i thought, in my state, they had somehow gotten lost at the table, i honestly don't know how but i distinctly remember thinking that i had to find them or else they would be lost forever. i found my way back to our car, and they were in there. i started knocking and telling them to let me in, but for some reason they wouldn't. sick of their shit, i started slamming, saying,"" if you fuckers don't let me in i will break this glass."" then, to my intense horror i realized this was in fact not our car, but somebody else's. i went back inside and sat down, my friends were there. they said they just watched me walk up to the table, say,"" i gotta find them."" and then walk outside. i can confidently say i was high even the next morning, which freaked me out even more. safe to say i will follow recipes to the t from now on.

edit: now i'm kinda mad i used my throwaway account for this.

edit: i get it, i'm not a heavyweight, hence my overestimation by a long shot. this has turned into a dick length contest- ""you think you're a heavyweight? i smoke 2 oz a week,"" or, "" you think you're a heavy weight? you are fucking stupid you small child, little dick, cunt. i smoke an 1/8 a day, and smoke wax constantly you fucking pussy. i also fucked your girlfriend."" like jesus calm down.

edit: many people doubt this story due to me not describing how i made the cannabutter, all i can say is that this is the story of how i fucked up, not how i made cannabutter. if you must know, yes i decarbed it (55 minutes at 220, in between foil on a baking pan) , then blended, and cooked it in a pan till it browned, dark brown close to a burnt smell, but not. i then blended it again. i didn't have cheescloth to strain, so i didn't extract the weed, just blended it in.  the strain was sour diesal. hmu w anymore questions to ""debunk"" me, i'd be happy to answer.",4

"by opening an incognito tab in a board room full of managers. nsfw. a few nights ago before bed, i opened an incognito tab and used a website that should be closed immediately after. i guess i was tired so i accidentally minimized the tab instead and went to bed. a few days went on and i hadn't used my laptop (my clinical job doesn't usually require it) but yesterday i had a council meeting and had to present some work i'd been writing for the unit. i walk into a small conference room with all my managers and their bosses, ready to present. my direct manager is to my left and to my right is a guest manager from another unit. as i get ready to share my work and open my laptop, open to word, everything looks fine. i present and everyone loves the ideas, etc. and my boss asks me to write her an email summary of what i presented. i then go to click on my google app and out pops a black and orange screen with obscene scenes being portrayed. cue blushing and panic. i close it as quickly as i can and look over to my left with my direct manager who seems to be focused on something else so okay we're fine i think but then i look over to my right and the guest manager is trying to look anywhere but at me... completely red. i play it off as nothing happened and finish the meeting as best as i can but you can feel the awkward energy radiating from her. hopefully i never have to apply for a transfer to her unit... or see her again!!! 

tl;dr was giving a presentation in a board room full of managers and opened an inappropriate website in between two of them. my immediate manager didn't see but the guest to my right turned red and avoided eye contact at all costs for the rest of the meeting.",4

"i'm a guy, and wearing panties has gotten me to exercise. i suppose i wanted to talk about this, make sense of it.  i'm a guy, tall and slender with what you'd call an effeminate build.  i never had chest hair although my legs are hairy.  i never much liked my body.  i have no upper body definition and always thought of myself as scrawny: when i pull in my stomach you can see my ribs.  any exercise i got was coincidental in going throughout my day: walking and bicycling.  i tried to go to the gym in the past and do deadlifts and such, trying to get the big biceps and pecs and such.  but i never really liked my body enough to keep with it.  trying to turn \*this\* into gaston from beauty & the beast was never a convincing goal.

&#x200b;

so, just recently, both out of curiosity and for an illicit thrill, i got myself some panties from victoria's secret.  they're the tight kind of cheekies with a seam up the back.  and i looked at myself and i thought: wow, i kind of have a nice butt.  i...kind of like the way i look in them.  i always wore baggy trousers and baggy boxers.  but i actually think i look good in tightly contoured underwear.  for the first time i thought i looked kind of sexy in the mirror, not flabby but really nicely slender but contoured.

&#x200b;

and this actually got me excited to do real exercise.  i've started to do crunches and twists to get my stomach flatter so i look even nicer in the mirror.  i've started to jog a mile at a time for the first time in years.  and yes, i still do get the illicit thrill of wearing panties, but it makes me feel like i can be secretly sexy in a kind of way.  something must be right with my body if i can wear size small cheekies out of the house and not have them feel very constricting.  and the feeling is more like pride than active arousal.  who knows, maybe having this kind of body isn't as bad as i thought.  i actually want to make it better now.

edit: i just want to say how wonderfully overwhelmed i am by everyone's heartwarming responses!  i wasn't sure how this would be received, but i couldn't have asked for anything better.  thank you so much to everyone with their encouraging words, now i am definitely going to keep up my regimen and not feel ashamed about it!",11

"by creating a dick-shaped island and getting suspended.. when i was in 8th grade science class we had to draw and create our own land mass in order to demonstrate our understanding of wind patterns, low and high pressures, etc. i thought of the idea to make the island in the shape of a dick. our group drew it out. of course we were smart enough to make it resemble a dick but not entirely, we made sure to make it curvy on the sides, edges where the balls were, stuff like that... but it clearly was a dick. we added tornadoes near the balls to look like pubes, added futures like 'seamen lake' and 'crabs port'. we finished and wrote the amazing title, ""penn island"", or pennis land. we wrote it in big, bold, letters at the top and turned it in. a couple days later our science teacher called my group up to his desk... uh oh... but, we we were not in trouble. instead he said something along the lines of, ""i would like to put this out in the hall, this is really great work"". amazed, we all in unison agreed. for months our penn island was out in the hall, everyone saw it, everyone laughed and giggled. but the teachers never noticed until one day a parent called the school saying her daughter had told her about penn island. eventually he called our group up after class and told us about it. then out of no where, he started crying... he apologized for letting us get into trouble, he explained how its his job to keep kids from getting in trouble. he apologized to us. he said it was his fault. to this day i still feel bad for him, it was never his fault. he was a good guy. the funny part was when we played dumb with him and he had to explain to us why ""seamen port"" was inappropriate.

oh yeah, i ended up getting suspended for a day (the vice principal said i was very clever (one of my proudest moments)). only me though, since my asshole group members made a plan to blame it all on me... fuck them. 

tl;dr i drew an island in the shape of a dick for a project and it sat in the hall for months without anyone noticing, eventually a parent found out... leading to my suspension.

edit: no, i don't have a picture of it. but here is what it basically looked like. the shaded part was brown, and the rest of penn island was green. the original was on a 4ft x 4ft paper poster haha. (yes, those mini islands at the top are exactly what you think)

"found out my predecessor earned 37% more than i earn now. how do i approach this for negotiations?. a little over a year ago, both my wife and i were unemployed with our first child on the way. i landed an interview, but thought i bombed it. but two weeks later, i got a phone call from hr double checking my salary requirements. i replied with $60k, which was about 10% more than i made at my previous job. i thought there would be some negotiating, but they sent me an offer letter with the full 60k. i obviously accepted.

fast forward a year. i love my job and the people i work with. everything is great.

i have access to my predecessor's inbox to be able to find pertinent information/conversations regarding old projects. one day while doing exactly that, i saw an electronic copy of her w2. i really shouldn't have clicked it, but my curiosity got the better of me and i saw that she earned over 80k in base salary. obviously i got a bit of sticker shock, then a little jealous.

without addressing salary at all, i asked my manager how my work compares to that of my predecessor. i know she was well liked and good at her job, so i wanted to double check that there were no gaps in job responsibilities or performance that could be used to justify a lower pay grade. my manager assured me that my performance has been equal in most cases and even exceeds in a few areas.

so i guess my question is this. in the next month or so, i have an official performance review with the head of hr, my boss, and the owner of the company (small business, approx $20mil in sales annually.) how can i use this new found knowledge to approach this conversation? obviously i am not going to mention the w2. i have been very happy with this company and have no desire to leave. i don't even truly feel underpaid. but now that i know that i left money on the table, i want to see what we can work out.

"to the tire store employee who helped me on december 24th 2009. i'll never forget you.

that was one of the biggest snow seasons our area had seen in quite a few years. i had spent every dime i had to purchase that brand new set of studded snow tires the previous week. no one expected the snow to stick, let alone stick around for the better part of the month.  i didn't have much money, and had to buy them unplanned so i could be sure my daughter would be safe when we drove to and from school, and so i could even get out and about as the roads were such a mess.

when i pulled in with the rear left completely flat, you asked me how long it had been driven on like that. i was honest with you. a long way. i had no way to remove it, the roads were a mess and down to one lane in most places. in the middle of many heavy snowfalls that month, it getting dark out, and with my daughter in the car, i had to just keep driving to get us somewhere safe, and warm, where we could figure out what to do.

we warmed up in the lobby. when you rolled that tire inside and your manager showed me the damage from driving on it flat, as well as the piece of metal you pulled out, i was shocked. he explained that it couldn't be saved. driving on it flat had destroyed it. i hadn't purchased the extended warranty and needed to buy a new tire.

i don't know what you saw in my eyes as i stood there after you told me that, but i feel like somehow you knew the situation i was in from that glance. 

a newly single father to a five year old girl. someone struggling to make ends meet. someone who didn't have a pot to piss in, let alone the money to even buy a nice set of tires like that to begin with. someone who was going hungry every night, watching my daughter eat dinner, and lying through clenched teeth that i had already eaten, so she should go ahead and i'll just sit with her. someone who had spent every penny i had that month. someone who was feeling more hopeless than ever in that moment.

you asked me to hold on for a minute, and you disappeared into the back with my tire through the door your manager had walked through. 

you came back a moment later without the tire.  i'll never forget trying not to break down and cry, as you told me it was obvious it was a defective tire. that it was flawed from the factory. that the hunk of metal that had pierced it, and the shredded rubber from me driving on it flat had nothing to do with the issue. that you were going to replace it for free then and there.

i don't know if you paid for it, or if you convinced the boss to replace it. i don't know why you wouldn't look me in the eye as i stood there trying to keep back tears, my 5 year old daughter hanging off me oblivious. maybe it was because you didn't want us to be a couple of guys having a cry together in the tire store during your busiest time of the year. whatever the case is, i want you to know, you saved me that day. saved me from the hopelessness i was feeling. restored my faith in humanity just when i was feeling as down as i had ever been. saved me from myself since i was at the end of my rope.

i want you to know, i've paid it forward ever since. helping stranded motorists. changing tires, giving jump starts, giving rides to people out of gas.  i even gave an elderly woman a ride later that week. she was waiting for the bus in knee deep snow trying to go to the library, and i pulled over and offered her a lift.

i want you to know that life is good now. i'm financially secure, everyone is healthy, happy and well fed. 

i want you to know, i'll never forget you.",11
"by giving the cat a dutch oven. so this happened this morning and i'm going to post this on an alt account because people know my main one lmao.

this morning, like every morning, i took a shower. i woke up kinda late, and was real hungry, so i went straight from the shower to the kitchen to make myself a sandwich.

i was wearing only my towel because i'm a lazy shit and no one's home. as i'm grabbing the sandwich shit, the house cat is rubbing up against my legs. now, a note on this cat - i hate it. i hate it so much. it isn't cuddly, its real bitey, and it also fucking hates me back just as much. and now, because food is involved, it wants to be my friend. fuck you, housecat. fuck you.

i get this idea in my head that it would be hilarious to hotbox the cat with a fart. i can trap it under the towel since it's right there under me and she will literally not know what is about to be unleashed. i put my sandwich shit down and i commit to the plan, because i'm a fucking retard.

so i squat down a bit, because i want a nice seal using the beach towel as sort of shower curtain against the floor. i want this shit hermetic. fuck you, cat.

in position, i'm giggling, mostly naked in the kitchen, about to fart on a cat. i release the hounds. nothing happens. i try harder because at this point i am committed.

something happens.

the cat is now covered in a thin film of watery liquid shit. aghast at this development, cat decides to go batshit and panic. cat claws the everliving shit out of my ballsack and streaks off around the house. i had to chase it down and throw a poop-towel over it to calm it down, and then quickly take it to the bathroom to both bathe the cat (which it hates) and peroxide my torn up balls (which i hate)

e- the cat was given my sandwich as recompense  
e2- a lot of people are real mad and acting like i specifically woke up this morning with the malicious intend to shit on the cat. this was not the case. i misjudged a harmless fart. please stop threatening me with violence, lmao. i am already suffering the instant karma of a blended nutsack.

after talking for a bit we were flirting a little and she asked me if i was horny. i jokingly said ""always lol wbu?"" to which she replied ""lol same here."" a minute later she sent me a back-to-the-mirror nude (with the kik camera so i knew it was real), and asked for one back, specifically asking for my ""face and dick,"" and that she'd pose however i wanted if i did. i agreed, and sent it. she replied ""you're so hot <3"" and i said she was too (because she was). she sent me a full frontal next and then said, ""so what do you want to see now?"" i gave my suggestion. this is where my heart sank.

the next 3 pictures she sends me are pictures of my family and i. she found me online. she showed me my full list of contacts on facebook and this immediately transformed from a late night sexy chat session to full on cyber blackmail. she said that unless i cooperated with her then she would send the pictures i had sent her to everyone on my contacts list. she then showed me screenshots of her doing it to someone else to prove she wasn't messing around. my family and i are christians, and we were a very close family. i couldn't even bear the thought of them seeing the shameful things i had been sending and saying. i was trapped. or at least i thought i was.

in defeat asked her what she wanted. and she told me that i was going to sign up to her websites. i asked how many and she said don't worry about it. just focus on this first one. she sends me a link saying, ""make sure you register through the link i sent you."" i said ok let me just get on my pc, but she told me to do it on mobile. i wasn't about to argue. i clicked the link, and it was a deep web hookup site that most of us have never heard of. one of those sites where they use your cc info for your ""free"" registration for age verification. here's where i started to actually think with my \*\*head\*\* and not with my ""head.""

i managed to convince her that i was working on the site and that fraud detection was blocking my card from the site (because that does happen) and for her to wait. she said to hurry up. i spent this time screen shooting everything we had said and sent to each other, including the photos of her. i was speed researching what to do in this situation legally, all while trying to figure out how i was going to explain nude pictures of me to my family, because there was no way i was putting my card on the deep web. i gathered all the information i could on her and told her that i wasn't doing it. she said ""ok. goodnight."" a minute later, she sends me a picture of her sending my nudes to my dad over facebook im.

i try to collect myself for a minute, but i can't. it's 3 a.m., but this was an emergency, so i called my mom. no answer. i leave her a voicemail explaining my situation and hung up. i called my dad. thank god almighty he picked up. i explained my situation to him trying my best not to burst into tears because i could only think of how disappointed my parents were going to be with me for the rest of my life. i underestimated them. my mom was there too and they said how i should proceed with taking my personal stuff off the web, and that they were not going to hold this over my head. they comforted me when i expected them to berate me for being so stupid. they showed me only love and understanding when i expected the opposite, and i almost burst into tears.

i am so blessed to have such a loving family. i won't be touching online dating again after this is all over.

tl;dr: i shared nudes with a girl and was cyber blackmailed. my sanity was saved by the love and understanding of my family.",4

"my landlord shut off the electricity in the middle of a heat wave. we are in new york. electricity is included in our rent. yesterday, the landlord put notices on our doors warning that our power consumption was ""unreasonable"" (trying to survive 100+ degree heat in a very poorly insulated building with no central ac will do that, i guess). she threatened to ""suspend service temporarily"" if we continued. the notice started with ""attention residents"" and i saw identical papers on some other doors, so i assume it was directed at all tenants.

2 hours ago she followed through with her threat. the power is out in my apartment. the hallways and stairs are barely lit. my landlord is not answering her phone.

what can i do? with the kind of person she is, i'm worried that she'll just wait for the end of the extreme heat, evade consequences by turning the power back on, and pull this shit again in the next heat wave.",2

"by throwing my steak out a window. last night, my wife's boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner. on the drive over, my wife reiterated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression. 

i scoffed and arrogantly informed my silly wife that i always make good impressions. 

my wife's boss is a single lady in her fifties, so it was just the three of us. we chitchatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. she laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased.

soon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. as i began to cut into my steak, i was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was.

now,  i've had my fair share of rare steak. i prefer medium, but i can handle rare. this was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. i probably could've resuscitated the cow had i tried. instead, i sat there fidgeting with my knife and fork, worrying about how i was going to get away with not eating this steak. 

claim vegan-ism? no, i'd already feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak.

just then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. as i looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head.

i knew i had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. i committed. i grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window.

here's the big time fu.  the window wasn't open.  it was the cleanest fricking window you've ever seen in your life. that is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake.

my wife - who's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like i was an alien from another planet. this look then slowly morphed into more of a there-is-no-place-on-this-planet-you-can-ever-hide-from-me expression of demonic anger. 

my wife's boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. she took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look.

i just didn't know what to say. it felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. finally, the best i could manage was ""i... i'm so sorry. i am such a clutz... i don't know... i was just cutting it.. and... it...  ... it slipped... just ask my wife, i really am a clutz... right honey?... (no help coming from that direction) ... i will clean this up... i can't believe this... i am so sorry"" etc... etc...

both women continued to stare at me like i had escaped from the loony bin, as i smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin, dusted off the steak, and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation. i knew no one was buying the story.

i knew what i had to do. i sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak. 

i remained pretty quiet the rest of the evening. my wife's only two words to me since the incident are ""i'm fine"". 

tl;dr:  tried to sneakily throw my under-cooked steak through an open window... only to find out it wasn't open.

edit: thanks kind redditors (:

update: just got the first post-""i'm fine"" communication from my wife, via text, who is at work...

"by giving a homeless guy $80. preface: 
*not trolling for money, thanks* 


so i'm a semi-broke grad student and lyft driver and this morning it was raining in my city. i ran into cvs to grab something and i was wearing an old coat with deep pockets (relevant to story). i also paid in cash which i never do as i rarely carry cash. so i walk out after buying my couple of items and see this older homeless man i often see in my neighborhood. i give him a dollar here or there some days when i can. he's in his wheelchair looking helpless and getting rained on so i figure, hey, even though i'm broke (as in my bills are insane and i make just enough atm to live and support my family) i can still give my coat because i have a few decent ones, i'm dry in my car today, this coat is older but in good shape and will keep him warm.... etc... so i give him the coat and he mumbles ""thanks"" and i smile and tell him to stay warm and off i go... later as i'm working i stop to grab gas and realize i put the $80 change from that morning into my coat pocket without thinking. i would never go ask for it back (obviously) but i had a moment of semi- panic before i accepted that i just gave this dude all that money. best ""screw up"" ever, i suppose. i'll live. i have to be totally honest and say i was upset at first but i'll get over it and it did make me stop and realize that i should be grateful for my blessings this time of year, no matter how broke i feel.

"by getting a handjob from my girlfriend on the day she leaves for college. this happened a few hours ago so i'm still feeling wired.

so basically, my girlfriend leaves tomorrow to go far away to school in miami. she's a year older than me so i'm not going anywhere. my parents are uber religious, very adamant that we have a non physical relationship. 

earlier today we were in my basement having a little fun as we do. my mom was upstairs but we've never had a problem with her coming down while we do stuff. anyway, there i was, about to blow my load, when i hear ""op and so, that's too far"". somehow my mom had walked downstairs completely silently so we didn't hear anything. but of course, like all the tifus, i was about to cum, so, dick in my girlfriends hand, i shot the fattest load all over myself, her arm, and the couch. i immediately pulled my pants up so my mom wasn't staring at my dick any longer than necessary. thankfully she walked outside without saying anything else. 

we're going out to dinner now, but i know how absolutely fucked i will be when i get home tonight. what a way to spend the last day with my girlfriend.

tl;dr: blew my load in front of my religious mom on my girlfriends last day at home.

update: thanks for the funny comments really gave me and my girlfriend a good laugh to lighten the mood. soon i'll be returning home and we'll see what happens.

"apartment maintenance man saw me in a state of undress, put his finger in my mouth.. throwaway because of how embarrassing this is for me. also i'm in pennsylvania. 

i moved into a new apartment complex at the beginning of august and have had no problems so far. a couple of weeks ago, i called maintenance to take care of peeling paint by my back door. a guy came, he fixed it, and i thought the issue was resolved.

fast forward to today, i've been extremely sick since the weekend. today i got back from class, took nyquil, and just laid down to sleep. i closed my bedroom door as an extra buffer against the noise my neighbors across the hall can sometimes make. i'm a deep sleeper anyway and taking it made me pretty much dead to the world. i had a fever breaking so i got incredibly hot before the medicine kicked in, so i stripped down to just my panties.

these next bits i'm fuzzy on because i was sleeping and didn't witness them. a maintenance guy came back to ""finish my paint job"" and let himself in when i didn't answer the door.  he saw my keys and stuff in my living room so decided to check if i was okay. he let himself into my bedroom and saw me there asleep. my blanket had become a tangled mess so he got a full view of my chest. he then put his finger in my mouth to wake me up. 

i was immediately woken by the finger and this guy told me all of this in a rush while i was incredibly confused and groggy. then i realized he could see me pretty much naked and screamed at him to get out. 

this happened just a few hours ago and i have no idea what to do. he might be telling the truth about being worried but it really bugs me he went into my bedroom. it bothers me more he put his finger in my mouth because it feels more sexual than just, say, shaking me or something, especially since i was undressed. should i just complain to the apartment complex? or should i call the police as well?",2

"by trying to show my turtle the view from my balcony.. so i was home alone one day with me and my wife's pet turtle and i was probably drunk or super bored and lonely because i was looking at the turtle in its tank and thought it would be a good idea to bring it to the balcony to see the view. we live on the 5th floor of an apartment building and while i was carrying my little friend in my hand i rested in on the railing with my hand still securely on it. but then out of nowhere, just as i was starting to relax, it started to flail around and i lost my grip of it and i watched as it fell down 5 floors and landed shell first on my 1st floor neighbour's head. the turtle was surprisingly unscathed but my neighbour had a pretty bad concussion and i ended up paying for his medical bills.

edit: since some are asking, yes the neighbour is ok. it was pretty bad at the time but fortunately didn't have any lasting effects. also turtle shells are insane.

"for adopting a dog with the same name as my daughter?. my wife and i have two kids, kristopher (9) and sadie (12). for kris' birthday last friday, my wife and i decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.

my wife and i decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because i've heard they have better temperaments. other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the humane society and when i got there, i immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb pit mix with beautiful green eyes. when i saw her name was sadie like our daughter, i thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. my wife thought the coincidence was funny when i told her, too, which is important.

so i arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last friday after a birthday dinner for kris. i pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) sadie. both kids were thrilled but kris was the happiest i'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until i told them her name. my daughter sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and immediately insisted that kris change sadie's name. she kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so i told her we'd talk about it later.

well, this week has been hellish. kris is insistent we keep sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. he says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and i think he has a point. i also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. my daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. my wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. i put my foot down because this is kris' birthday present and his choice.

she does not care about me or my future, or if she does she does it's not much and she never shows it, i feel like she would be content if i wasted my life rotting in this house for more years than i've already done.

my health is in a bad state, i have physical and mental illnesses, but i feel like i can't help myself to get better while i'm here, because staying here keeps me in a depressive state.

i am currently on ssdi but my mother pockets it. i think i need to remove her as payee. however, the ssdi is only 500 dollars a month. 

edit: many people are saying that's reasonable for her to take for food and rent, but she would keep the remaining money if there was some, and paying 500 for rent+food is a bit different than what i have which is rent+food+grief/hate. also, it's going up to 800 next month it looks like (from ss website member page).

i contacted a social services worker to be put on a waiting list for housing for mentally ill with some limited assistance with living, but the list takes up to 2 years. i think this would be ideal but it's also only opportunity i'm aware of.

do you have any advice for me? i don't feel like i can wait 2 years for housing. i live in the state of nj.

"by fucking myself with a stick full of maggots.. nsfl? if you're eating something then i'd suggest not reading this.

you ever seen those stories on the reddit museum of filth? like, the crusty cum shoebox or the rainbow dash figure that was boiled in a jar of cum, and realised 'why is there no female version of this?'. well, sit down because i'm about to tell you the story of how i inadvertently fucked myself... with a stick full of maggots.

&#x200b;

so, i have this pool diving stick that i use to fuck myself. i live with my parents so i can't really get an actual toy. now, this pool toy has two holes on the 'shaft' to allow water to fill in and out of it so it can sink to the bottom of the pool. this also allows it to fill with my girl juices when i use it. the problem? the fluid gets stuck in there since it's relatively more viscous than water. so i've had this thing for about 6 months. i try my best to clean it out by running it under the tap and rinsing it out every couple of weeks but i can never really get the solidly dry stuff. this, combined with the fact that i always just sort of shoved it down the side of my bed, or stuffed it in my bedside cabinet once i was done with it made for a pretty nasty smell. it wasn't usually that obvious unless you got close, but earlier today, once i had finished fucking myself, i put it in my drawer and sat up in my bed. i noticed that not only did it smelled significantly worse than usual, maybe due to the summer heat, but also 'down there' also felt like it was on fire. not enough to be painful, but enough for me to notice it.

&#x200b;

here's where the interesting part starts. i decide. 'hey, it's currently 4am, everyone is asleep, i can go and cut this thing open.' sort of like a fucked up episode of 'what's inside'. so i reach into my drawer, grab my phone and make my way downstairs into the kitchen where i clear out the sink and put this thing down in it. i use a pocket knife to start cutting it open, starting from one of the holes on the side. i'm scared to open it, but i understand that i must, and i put down the pocket knife and gently tease apart the two sides of the incision i made. 

&#x200b;

i. am. **horrified.** dozens of little maggots squirming around inside. i started gagging, until the realisation set in. 'i just stuck this thing inside of me. i may have maggots crawling around inside of my vagina right now.' the fact that they were maggots... doesn't that mean they had been there for a while? how long does it take fly eggs to hatch? in my state of panic, i snapped a quick photo (already knew that i was going to post that thing on 4chan), and rinsed out the entire thing with water, before cutting it into another 3 pieces and thoroughly rinsing them out with bleach and double wrapping them in a plastic bag and throwing it in the bin. i return to my room, disgusted, and make a 4chan post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/c6uwi5/femanon_embraces_her_inner_neckbeard/) i didn't know what to do after that, except wait for my family to wake up so i could have a shower without worrying about disturbing them. i have my shower and take a nap. that's the end.",4

i don't even know where to start. part of the reason i didn't update right away was because my thoughts have been all over the place as of late. i have been making major adjustments and dealing with a lot. 

my daughter is not actually mine. while it was incredibly hard to get through at first, i think that a small part of me was already mentally prepared for it. i just had a feeling. i hoped it wasn't true and i convinced myself that i was doing this just to rid my anxiety but i think deep down i knew. 

i took a lot of the advice given and i thought about it for a few days. after deciding how i was going to approach the conversation i asked my fiance to drop the baby off at her mother's house so we could have a night to ourselves. i made dinner and then tried to talk about things that we had been going through recently and how our lives had changed since having the baby. i explained that i had been having bad anxiety and that i believed that it was partially caused by becoming a new parent but also the fact that i was sterile one minute and then told we were having a baby the next. right away she saw where i was going with that and she did get a bit defensive. she continued to tell me that ""miracles happen"" and that she couldn't believe i didn't trust her. i explained that i saw exactly where she was coming from but asked that she saw it from point of view as well. we argued and she refused to do the test. i told her it was fine and that i would leave it alone. 

i wanted to leave it alone but she kept bringing it up all night even after i had apologized and said that i wouldn't bring it up again. she kept telling me that she couldn't believe i would think of her that way and that i should just ""be happy that we have a beautiful healthy daughter instead of trying to accuse her of cheating"". that's when i started to question her. something just didn't feel right and i knew i had to do the test regardless. i did the test the next day and waited a few days. by the end of the week i found out that she wasn't mine.

i cried for about two days straight, i just couldn't handle it and i had no idea what i was going to do. i tried to spend as little time in the house as i could because i knew she would see something was wrong right away. i struggled with figuring out how i would let her know that i knew. i also contemplated wether or not i should say anything because i knew that this would change things with my daughter. i  finally decided to just tell her. of course she denied it and said that the test was wrong and that i need to just drop it. i explained that the clinic said there was no way this could be an error. she continued to deny it and i just couldn't believe that she would still lie to me straight to my face. 

she threatened to leave and take the baby even though she has no where to go seeing as her own mother doesn't want to get involved. we've been pretty much ignoring each other when we're not dealing with the baby. she said that she will be out in 2 months and i'm glad. my concern right now is wether or not she has the right to take the baby. i love my daughter more than anything but i refuse to stay with this woman. i know the baby is not my blood but if i'm on the birth certificate does that help. i at least want to have shared custody. i bring on over half of the income of provide everything for the baby. there is no way that she could take care of the baby without me. she will not be able to afford it. i know there's probably no way possible for me to get some custody but is it pointless to fight for shared? i can't lose my daughter. as much as i hate what my fiance did, i don't even hate her. 

i can't explain how hard it is having to deal with losing someone i love so much but also knowing that they would do something so terrible. it's hard enough having to end this with her but i don't think i can handle not seeing my daughter anymore either. please help with any advice as far as how i can fight for shared custody if that's even possible given the circumstances. 

tldr: my daughter is not my blood. i don't know how to move forward. i don't want to lost my daughter regardless of the circumstances. 

edit: for ever person that feels the need to comment rude things like ""she is not your daughter"" please stop wasting your time. i am aware that she is not my blood. that does not take away from the fact that i have been the one taking care of her since she was born. i have been the one changing her diapers, feeding her, etc. it baffles me that some of you don't have the decency to understand that after creating this bond with her, i refuse to say she's not my daughter now. i know that this is reddit and that i am probably asking a lot of some of you but seriously how hard is it to just be decent person?

"how much bandwidth does the spinal cord have?. i was having an emg test today and started talking with the neurologist about nerves and their capacity to transmit signals.  i asked him what a nerve's rest period was before it can signal again, and if a nerve can handle more than one signal simultaneously.  he told me that most nerves can handle many signals in both directions each way, depending on how many were bundled together.

this got me thinking, given some rough parameters on the speed of signal and how many times the nerve can fire in a second, can the bandwidth of the spinal cord be calculated and expressed as mb/s?",9

"are there any other ""financial gurus"" (like dave ramsey) that do not intertwine religion with their advice?. i was looking for a good financial podcast to listen to on my way to work but i couldn't seem to find what i was looking for.  i don't dislike dave ramsey (despite thinking he is wrong on a few issues) but i'd rather not listen to someone who intertwines their religious views in their podcast.

update: it's not that i'm ""offended"" or put off by his religious views, but i was just wondering if there are different shows that may cover similar material and not incorporate religion in their show.  

and to those of you who are sending me private messages:  i'm not saying you are ""dumb"" if you listen to dave ramsey nor am i saying he shouldn't mention religion; it is just a preference of mine to not have that in a podcast about finance.

"i started working at a jail and have met the worst people i have ever known. they aren't the inmates.. i got a job working as a corrections officer about 2 months ago. i love my job. every day is different, there's always something to do, and i'm learning a lot. but some of my coworkers are sucking all the joy out of my new job. 

i became a jailer because i wanted to protect the rights and well being of a class of people often overlooked. i wanted to make a difference. every day, i do my best to be kind to my inmates. i smile and tell them good morning. i ask them how they're doing if they seem upset. i'll bring them a book from the library, even if it's not their assigned day to ask for books. i'll bring them pictures of loved ones out of their property locker when they ask me for it, even when i have a million other things to do, even when it means skipping the only break i have. i do all this because i believe in the power of an act of kindness. i believe that all people deserve respect and love, regardless of their actions. 

in my short time at the jail, i've been told by an inmate that i ""made him feel human again."" i've had an innate, tears streaming down her face, tell me that ""she could see my heart."" i've been thanked for being kind and told that i'm appreciated. i guess it's possible that some of these compliments are manipulative, but i choose to believe in them. 

but my coworkers. one in particular, who is a control room officer. she sits in a secured area and opens doors for me, and also hands me requested items through a small window. she is so jaded. she is mean and spiteful and it hurts my heart so much. an inmate who i've seen grimacing in pain all day will respectfully ask me for an aspirin, and my coworker won't allow me to give it because, ""i don't like that inmate, he can wait."" an inmate who has seemed depressed all week will finally drag himself out of bed and ask me for soap so he can take a shower, but my coworker will say, ""i don't feel like getting him soap right now, make him wait an hour or two for annoying me."" 

every polite request is met with an eye roll and an attitude. she complains every day that the inmates are ""annoying"" and ""too needy"" but all i can think is ""that our job."" our job is to take care of them. we're here to bring them soap and medicine. we're here to keep them warm and safe. 

i hate her. i hate her for taking out her lack of patience out on my inmates. i hate her for making me look bad when she denies them something for a non-reason. and to be honest, i've started to tell the inmates, ""i'm sorry, *coworker* said you can't have what you asked for. i don't know why."" 

she shouldn't be a co. she has no compassion. she has no patience. she has no desire to help these people. her only desire is to pass judgement and play god by denying them simple requests and punishing them in her own way for their alleged crimes. 

i believe in kindness and smiles. i have looked murderers and child rapists in the eye and still seen some good in them. but all i see when i look at her is hate and spite. 

and i am so, so scared that one day, this job is going to turn my in to her. i am so scared. ",11
"i kissed my baby over and over again not knowing if each one might be the last.. my beautiful baby girl is now 10 months and she is the light of my life.

just under a day after she was born she started to have seizures. she was taken from me and sent to another hospital. 
i was in a lot of pain from having a c-section but i had to get up and walk and pretend i was ok otherwise i wouldn't of been allowed to join her.
i stayed in the ward below her and would walk up to see her all hours of the day and night, sometimes clinging on to the walls to catch a breath from the pain.
i waited outside her room and heard her screams as they did 4 lumbar punctures. my heart was broken and no one knew what was wrong with her.
they sent us home after 3 weeks to wait and see if she had any more seizures.
the next day she had more at home and we took her to the emergency room in an ambulance.
when we arrived there were so many doctors and nurses and i knew it was serious.

no one told me to move out of the way as they inserted wires into her head and body. some people may have asked me to but they just let me kiss her and hold her hands.
i just kissed her tiny face over and over and in my head i kept saying if this is the last kiss then please know that i love you so much.
it took 8 hours until the seizures finally stopped and my heart broke every time she was taken from me, wondering if i would ever see her again.

just under ten months later she is now being weaned off her medication and her future looks really bright.

i kissed her little cheek today and thought wow i can't believe there was a time when i thought one kiss might be the last. i'm so grateful for her and all the medical professionals who helped her.

*edit*

wow thank you so much i did not expect such a huge response. you are all such loving, supportive, amazing people and thank you for sharing some of your stories with me too. 
for those who have asked, she had tonic clonic seizures. they are different to febrile seizures but both are very distressing and i am sorry some of you have had to go through a similar situation. it really is not something you can prepare for as a parent, i hope you are all doing ok.

for those that have asked what the cause was, we are still not sure entirely but they have carried out all the tests possible to be confident that there will not be any more. we will be keeping an eye on things for a while longer as her calcium is still high but it is all looking very positive. she does have a chromosome abnormality which has been detected but with no known clinical consequence so far, so all in all it's looking like things will be ok.

for the person who called me out on the spelling of no one (i spelt it knowone)! i have literally been spelling it like that my entire life and had no idea i was wrong. thank you i've edited the spelling mistake 😊 

and to all of you lovely lovely people....may your god, spirits, energies or just plain old good luck and vibes bring you happiness in your lives.

"for throwing away my daughters vibrator. i have a 18 year old daughter who lives with me. she's in college so i let her live here rent free. i also have 3 other children who are 11, 6 and 2. my 11 and 18 year old share a bathroom, and the 6, 2 year old and myself use mine.

my daughters bathroom is currently out of order due to some pipes so we've all been sharing mine. 

my 18 year old daughter has been taking long long baths lately, and i know why. she's masturbating. it's uncomfortable but i want her to know her body.

but she's been leaving her vibrator on the counter when she leaves my bathroom. i've told her 4 separate times she needs to take it with her, because her siblings don't need to get a hold of it and if she keeps doing this i'm going to get rid of it.

this morning it was once again left on my counter, so i threw it away in the outside trash. 

she stormed into my bedroom while i was getting ready yelling at me about how dare i throw away something she paid for with her own money, and i'm just trying to shame her blah blah blah. 

it was a relatively expensive vibrator, and i do feel slightly bad about throwing it away instead of just reprimanding her again, but i feel like i had to because she wasnt listening.


for throwing away my daughters vibrator?

eta: i'm her mom. i'd be fucking mortified if i was her father and i knew my teenage daughter was masturbating in my bathtub. my husband and i are divorced.

eta #2: i thought about hiding it, but i know my child, she would get another one and keep doing it. doing something extreme like throwing it away was the only way to get my point across. while yes she is an adult and she bought it with her own money, she lives in my house with 0 bills, 0 responsibilities. she goes to school (which i'm so proud of) and she works part time. other than that, i care for all her needs. this is my house and my young children and she didn't respect my boundaries i tried to gently but firmly set the first time. maybe that makes me the asshole and i will full heartedly accept that.


last edit but i'm fixing the bathroom. i'm not just leaving it alone, but it takes a while. this has only been over the course of a week.

also i don't think i'm the asshole and i think i'm completely justified but i'm not gonna delete the thread because 1) it's on the front page and 2) there's some good discussion going on.

also, i am 35 years old. i had my eldest daughter at 17. i'm not some old ass boomer. i'm pretty young.",3
"for deciding not to tell my family that the surgery i'm getting will probably kill me?. i'm getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and i was told there's a 60-80% chance it will kill me. it's 60% if i do all the things the surgeon told me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of protein) and i'm following all the rules. so let's say my chances of dying are 60%. that's not great but not too horrible.

the thing is that i've had this exact surgery before and i came out just fine so my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the risk involved with any surgery). however for reasons involving my medical condition (tm), this time the surgery is riskier.

my family consists of my older brother (28m) who i (27m) live with and my mom (54f) who lives on the other side of the country. my brother is very protective of me and my mom still acts like i'm her little boy. the only reasons i could think of to tell them would be:

1. give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. but i don't think this is something they can prepare for. i'm sure they'd just be miserable for the time leading up to the surgery. i don't want that.
2. give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. again i don't think that can happen when we'd only be doing it because i might die soon. it would feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable and i'd be unhappy because i would know they're miserable.

i'm leaning towards ""ignorance is bliss"" for everyone involved. if i survive, no harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. if i die, well that's a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn't have had that misery. and with my medical condition (tm) it's unlikely i'd make it to retirement age anyway.

but is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it's to spare them pain? what are your thoughts?

edit: the surgery is 100% necessary. i will die without it, but it would take maybe a year or so and be very unpleasant.

edit2: i've already gone over how i'd want my body dealt with the last time i had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn't want it). i have no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.

edit3: i will write letters to them.

edit4: maybe i wasn't very clear about this because a few people have commented about it. i'm not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is. they're going to come see me off and we'll say our i love yous and good lucks at the hospital.

edit5: i already have an advanced medical directive from the last time i had this surgery.

and yes i promise to post an update if i survive! you're all very sweet for wishing me well. it turns out reddit isn't as scary as i feared (i just joined and this is my first post).

edit6: thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! i honestly don't know what i want anymore. there seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me feeling pretty drained. i'm going to take a break and recharge.

edit7: okay i'm feeling very overwhelmed here. i was only expecting to get 10 comments, maybe 20 at the most. now there's nearly 400 comments. i wrote this post feeling pretty confident of my decision but i wanted to see if anyone out there had a different perspective, another point of view that i hadn't considered. after reading over 100 of these comments i don't know what i should do anymore. i'm feeling guilty for hiding this but i can't see what the right thing to do is. there probably *isn't* a right thing to do.

so many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved one. i'm truly sorry you had to go through that and i appreciate your perspectives. i'm going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.

ps: to all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but i understand) you should make it for four weeks. if i survive, i'll need time to recover and get out of the icu before i come back to reddit.",3
"so my (m/27) gf (f/23) went out for dinner and some drinks with this guy she had a crush on. she always told me he was „just a friend"" and she doesn't „even see him as a male"". anyway, i recently found out they had sex and kinda dated shorty before we started dating. is it wrong being hurt?. hi reddit,

french guy here, so please excuse my english. but i guess you'll get the point.

long story short: there was this guy and i always kind of felt like he and my now-gf have had something in the past. i know him and saw him occasionally. however, my gf and i started dating about two years ago and we made fun of this guy on a regular basis and she assured me she had never ever dated this guy nor had there been any feelings between them both. i believed her, since she was looking straight in my eyes when saying these things with a confidence that i would've never doubted that this was the truth. 

fast forward: we started dating and about two months in the relationship she got a message from that guy asking if she wanna meet the week after to get some drinks, since he was in paris that day. she told me and asked if i was cool with her meeting that guy next week. well, i am not really cool with it, but fuck it, he's a friend and who am i to tell her who she is allowed to meet anyway. i told her so. however, i was kind of hurt and also angry (kept this for myself) that she didn't ask if i wanted to join her - i would've not wanted to join (he's a jerk, seriously!), but i somehow think it would have been appropriate to ask though. i would have asked her if i was in her place. 

i told her that i feel uncomfortable that she's gonna meet him.. in the late evening..just the two of them..having drinks..without me. she got annoyed and was arguing with me, giving me the feeling that i was totally wrong and that she really wanted to meet a friend of hers and that it's me who is keeping her from doing so because i was an overly jealous macho (which i am not at all). so i gave in and told her that if she wanted to go and see him, she shall do it. she did,

i was annoyed, but told myself that i had no right to feel this way and with some time passing by i didn't really think of it anymore. a couple of months later i was looking for some documents that i needed for an appointment the following day and, accidentally, found a nice looking scratchpad. i didn't know it and wanted to see if it was empty and if so i would've used it for work notes (i have lots of such pads). so i was rapidly skimming the pages, not expecting or looking for anything and - there was his name, literally jumping me in the eye! i wouldn't have read a single word if i hadn't read his name - it was like ""fuck! please let it be something trivial."". but it wasn't trivial at all: 

she was in love with him, she even wrote it down many many times, and when i asked her she always told me that they had something a few months before we dated. so all the times we made fun of him being an idiot, every time she told me that she would've never go out with him, that he was just a friend..... all lies, lies she has told me right in my face. and then she would go out with him when we were already dating for months and making me feel uncomfortable because i didn't want her to see him that evening?! 

i was shattered and probably still am. it's that she lied to my face, making an idiot out of me by making fun of him though knowing she had something with him, and telling me she wouldn't even see him as a male so she could see him that evening. what. the. fuck, 
sure i was playing things through in my head, everyone is afraid of being hurt, but i seriously never ever would have thought that she would do something like this to me (or anyone else), she's a perfect partner, who just would not do ""such things"". i was so wrong and couldn't really handle my emotions and broke down for the rest of the day, still being in ""fights"" with my mind which fucks with me from time to time. i still think that i am not knowing all about what was going on with him and her and sometimes it's killing me inside. 

i love this woman from the bottom of my heart and i am sure she is ""the one"" for me so i never even thought about leaving her, because i never would. and i have no doubt that she loves me, too. but it hurts so badly and i just had to get this off my chest, hoping there are people who can tell me what they did when they have been in such a situation. what eases the pain and what can i do to trust my partner again 100%? i don't want this to be something that haunts me all my life.

thanks.

tl;dr
gf met with a guy we both know for dinner and drinks. didn't ask me to join them and most importantly, she lied about sleeping with him shortly before we dated although i asked her exactly this many times because i always thought they have had something going on in the past. why didn't she tell me right at the start? - there would've been no problem now at all. why would she want to meet him anyway?
i am hurt, feeling somehow ""betrayed""and want to get this out of my mind and relationship for good.",7
"nip lifestyle creep in the bud - before it's too late. i turned 40 just over a month ago and for a number of reasons it's a pretty glaring milestone in the history of one's life.

on average you're half way to climbing into a coffin for a long well-deserved dirt nap and so naturally it makes sense to ponder your midterm report card.

whether you want to or not, it's kind of human nature to look around to your peers...to see how you are matching up to your buddies - not so much as a dick measuring contest but more so simply as part of the global analysis.

and 40 is a time in your life where some of your friends start to get those ""real"" promotions...the kind where they make partner or earn a seat in the board room or their business really takes off...the kind of step-up that makes it possible to never have to worry about money ever again (if you play your cards right).

but one thing i noticed is that so many people i know who are now pulling in this kind of dough are far from financial independence.

i know a lot of couples earning well over $200k as a household and they still worry about money and not having enough.

and the reason is lifestyle creep.

**they call it ""creep"" because it's sneaky**

it happens to pretty much everybody who's ever earned more money than they used to.

take a look at your clothes. your food. your furniture. your home. your car. your entertainment...and on and on and on.

you upgrade almost all of this stuff - when you were perfectly happy ten years ago with a similar version that cost half as much.

instead of your favorite candy - you've now moved up to your favorite wine.

items that used to be luxury are now the norm and your new wants are things that never before entered your mind's eye.

you're spending more because you have it - not because it's truly necessary.

you've slowly but surely made a complete shift with regards to what's ""normal"" and over time far too many wants make their way over to the needs category.

and all the while it never crosses your mind because it's happening slowly, like the tortoise catching up with the hare.

**the time to catch it**

and the time to nip this phenomenon in the bud is now. 

because once you creep forward it's pretty tough to creep back.

once you're used to wine and brie, it's hard to enjoy kool-aid and velveeta.

it's hard to move back into a smaller house. it's hard to sell your flash new audi to drive a used toyota. it's hard to head back to the nosebleeds once you're used to box seats! it's hard to pack your lunch every day when you absolutely can afford to eat out every single day.

it's much easier to beat lifestyle creep in advance - long before you're used to all these unnecessary upgrades.

**why don't you fuck off back to /r/frugal :)**

before the ""why work hard to get ahead if you're not going to enjoy your money?"" retorts start rolling in...i'm not saying that we shouldn't upgrade our lifestyles as we start to earn more money.

of course we should. of course we should reward ourselves with nice things and vacations and new cars and bigger homes when appropriate. 

what i am saying is that we should do it consciously, in a deliberate manner - to make sure that our upgrades are measured and to ensure that our choices fit our personal tastes and that we're not ""moving on up"" just because.

we should upgrade our lives in such a way that we don't wind up earning twice as much money only to find that finances are just as tight as ever.

**the simplest stop gap**

the easiest way to stop yourself from increasing expenditures in proportion to increased earnings is to set an actual number with regards to how greatly you'll allow your lifestyle to creep.

some people like 50/50.

if you get a $10,000/year raise - half is for improving quality of life and half goes straight into savings.

maybe a different ratio works better for you...just be sure you don't spend it all.

**discover what's important to you**

for me i've found that one of the best ways i have been able to control lifestyle creep is in being truly honest with myself about which aspects of my lifestyle are actually important to me. when we were living off an insanely tight budget to save up the money to build gecko rock we were able to truly see which luxuries we missed and which ones we didn't.

we now spend money where it matters (to us) and get by with ""inferior"" goods where it doesn't really matter (to us).

my wife and i spend on travel but never pay full price for an item of clothing. we enjoy good food but would never dream of spending hundreds of dollars on a watch or jewelry.

find out what's important to you and spend your upgrade funds there...don't spend money to buy goods that are really only a luxury to someone else.",10
"my(27m) wife(27) told me she was pregnant. when i told my brother(17), he burst into tears and said it was his.. the title basically says it all. i got home from work last night and my wife was sitting on the dining table with a positive pregnancy test. of course, i was ecstatic. we've been trying for a couple months now. 

today, i called my parents, she called hers. my parents were overjoyed. my brother was at school when i first called, so i gave him a ring afterwards. when i told him the big news, my brother was quiet for a few seconds. i thought he'd hung up until i heard him sobbing. he told me that my wife had apparently raped him several times over the past two months. he said he never told anyone because ""boys can't be raped"". 

i couldn't get another word in. my brother hung up on me. i tried calling him back, but he didn't answer any of my calls. i would have gone over to speak to him in person, but me and my wife recently moved halfway across the country. i called my parents and told them to make my brother call me back. 

i didn't tell any of this to my wife. we just continued on as normal. i don't know what to do. i don't have any solid evidence, so i can't exactly confront my wife. but if my brother is telling the truth, it means i have to seriously reconsider my relationship with my wife. to be honest, i already am.

i don't know what to do. it's really late, and my wife is asleep beside me. i can't sleep. i need an outsider's opinion. i know i need to speak to my wife about this, but i don't want to ruin anything by falsely accusing her of something so serious. i love my wife, and i can't see her ever doing something so vile, but i also can't believe my brother would lie about this. between the ""boys can't be raped"" line, as well as the fact that he any my wife have had an excellent relationship since they first met, it just seems unlikely he's lying. 

so i need help. i don't know how to bring this up without sounding accusing. my wife's so happy about this pregnancy and i don't want to shoot down her high. my brother still hasn't returned my calls, either. what do i do?

edit: i took a walk around the block to clear my head and ended up crashing when i got back. i should clarify: my wife and i moved late october. there was a family gathering/going away party a few days before we left. as far as i know, she's around eight weeks along. the math is too perfect here, i'm afraid it's impossible. and before that, my wife was in charge of picking up my brother from school. she'd often bring him to our apartment(with my parents' permission) do he could have dinner with us when i got back. also, i'm not sure if this is important, but my brother has a history of self-harm.",7

&#x200b;

throwaway for obvious reasons.  also sorry for the long post.

&#x200b;

my wife(w) and i started dating about 5 years ago and got married 2.5 years ago, and we've had 2 kids since getting married.  we've known each other for over 10 years however, and i always thought she was a trustworthy friend.  she expressed her feelings for me a year before we started dating, but we had both just gotten out of other relationships and needed time to heal.  she then studied abroad for half a year.  when she got back, we hit it off and started dating within a month.  when w and i became ""exclusive"", my best friend(f) ghosted us.  i couldn't figure out why, seeing as how the three of us were all good friends, and had hung out several times since w had gotten back.  i had even talked to f about w and i possibly dating multiple times, which never seemed to bother him, he even encouraged it.  f had a girlfriend of his own at the time anyways.

&#x200b;

about a month into dating, w tells me a story of something that happened between her and f.  4 months prior, f went to visit one of his friends who was studying in a neighboring country to w.  he also decided to stop and see w for a couple days to see the country she was in.  in w's words, they went to a bar one night and she had way too much to drink.  she woke up in her bed that night to f taking advantage of her.  she pushed him off but he kept on trying over and over.  i hear this and instantly i am livid with f.  he had already been avoiding me for the past month, so i just stopped any attempt at talking to him.  i figured f stopped talking to us/didn't try to explain himself because he was ashamed of what he did.  w said she was confused about the situation and didn't really get angry about it until she had returned from abroad and seen f in person.  i had no reason not to trust w at this time and she seemed very sincere and upset talking about the whole thing.

&#x200b;

that was 5 years ago.  throughout the years when f comes up in conversation, w always talks about how gross what he did was.  recently however, w and i have been going through a rough patch in our relationship.  we started to fight a lot, which exclusively is always started by w.  she would complain about things i did(or didn't do) around the house, which would lead to name calling, threats of divorce, and even accusations of lying and even cheating on her(which is not true).  our sex life went from okay(i'm the hl in the relationship) to a dead bedroom.  she blamed it on hormones(pregnancy/postpartum) but it really was getting extreme.  these things made me suspicious of her.  i thought maybe she's feeling guilty about something.

&#x200b;

so i snooped.  i know its a kind of shitty thing to do, but things have gotten bad and i wanted to know if she was hiding something.  i went on her laptop when she wasn't home, and i found all her iphone backups.  long story short, nothing incriminating came up since we've been together.  just texts between girlfriends about kids and whatnot.  that's a relief.  but then i found the texts from before we were dating.  i know she had some experiences when studying abroad, she's told me everything(or so i thought) so i took a peek.  and there they were, the texts between w and f talking about hooking up when they were abroad.  w saying how great the sex was, how f should visit again so they could do it again, and how she felt bad because at the time he had a girlfriend.  plenty of graphic details that all seem 100% consensual.

&#x200b;

this honestly crushed me, and not because they hooked up.  but because she's been lying to me for five years about this.  she convinced me that my best friend raped her.  i've even told my family about how much of a scumbag he is, and i erased him from my life entirely.  there were plenty of other lies about her past that i found throughout her phone that just twist the knife even further.  i feel like the last 5 years of my life has been shaped by this series of lies.  had she told the truth from the start, i probably could have looked past it.  but here i am, just learning about these things now in an entirely more complicated situation.  i don't even know how to start a conversation about this with her.  whats the best course of action here?",7

"just because you've self-identified as an introvert doesn't mean that you're smart, thoughtful, deep, unique or in any way special. occasionally on reddit and other social media outlets, you'll see clever posts about how amazing introverts are.  these are usually short cartoons or meme-like productions depicting a solitary person, alone with their own dazzling intellect, clutching a giant cup of hot coffee with both hands, eschewing the brazen crowds and just being really cool and unique and...alone.

sorry, introverts.  

being an introvert doesn't automatically make you smart.  it doesn't mean you are wise and seek knowledge in the silence of your solitude.  it doesn't mean that the people around you who are extroverts and are able to socialize normally are mentally inferior to you.  being stricken with introversion didn't come with an automatic +2 on your intelligence and wisdom scores.  

you are not better than the people around you because you are in introvert.  it just means you're shy and like to be alone.

"by cleaning my humidifier and almost killing my entire family. obligatory - this actually did happen today.

my family and i live in the sun-blasted hellscape that is central arizona, usa.  the whole area is a hot, dry desert, and if you live outside of the city (as we do) it's common to see relative humidity in the teens, and single digits are not uncommon.  for those who don't live somewhere that's anathema to life, that's very dry.  since we aren't a family of kangaroo rats, we keep the air in our house comfortable with an evaporative humidifier.  basically, a pump drips water on an absorbent pad, and a fan pulls air through that pad to blow out more humid air to the house.  it's one of the full household-sized jobs that will humidify your air with twelve gallons of water a day.

for various reasons not apropos to this tifu, the humidifier hadn't been maintained well for the last few weeks.  today i decided to change the filter and give it a good cleaning.  possibly inspired by another recent tifu, i also decided to attack the calcium buildup with a 1/3 vinegar solution.  while cleaning, though, i noticed a sliminess that made me think that there was bacterial growth.  ""no big deal,"" thought i.  eventually a biofilm will grow on something that's always wet, no matter what precautions you take.  i scrubbed off the biofilm, cleaned the calcium scale with my vinegar solution, and reassembled the unit.

here's where the really starts.  some parts of the mechanism aren't accessible - they are in the pump, water lines, etc.  i decided to run my vinegar solution though for a few minutes to dissolve some calcium deposits in places i couldn't reach.  ""but,"" thought i, proving that too much thinking causes trouble, ""there's probably bacteria in there, too.""  i figured i should add something that would kill the bacteria and what, i figured, is better at that than bleach?

right now, readers with some chemistry are thinking, ""uh, dude..."" yeah, i know.  or, i should have known.  but i didn't think it through, so i poured some bleach into the humidifier, followed by the remains of my vinegar solution, and turned it on to pump the mixture into the water lines.  almost immediately thereafter, i took a whiff and started coughing.  at that point the little voice that remembered my college chemistry finally was heard.  turns out mixing a sodium hypochlorite solution (like, say, bleach) with a weak acid (like, say, vinegar) creates chlorine and chloramine gasses, both of which are very toxic - like, they have been used as actual chemical weapons toxic, and i'd just put them in a goddamn distribution system.

i immediately unplugged the humidifier and carried it to the bathroom, turned on the vent fan, and poured my ersatz chemical weapon down the bathtub drain.  of course, the pouring process gave me another good snoot of the offending vapors.  so now the house is airing out, the wife, son, and dog are playing in the backyard for a bit, the wife is trying to mail back my engineering degree, and for the next few days i'll be coughing like i've got the black lung, pa.

tl;dr - tried to clean my humidifier, accidentally tried to kill my family trench warfare style.

edit - words

edit 2 - front page, neat.  it has been pointed out that there wouldn't be chloramine, just chlorine - i think this story shows that chemistry isn't my forte.  finally, to those giving me shit for making sure to mention that i'm an engineer, i have to - if everyone doesn't know, i'm just some guy with a lot of student loan debt.  can't have that.

"my rescue dog finally approached my boyfriend and let him pet her. edit: thanks for the gold and silver award, for loving dogs, rottweilers and supporting rescue rehabilitation!!!! 💝

my dog roxy, aka roxas, was rescued by my mother when i was a teenager, almost eight years ago now. an absolutely beautiful rottweiler, she had been horribly beaten and abused by her previous owner. the previous owner was a very tall male with beard and a deep, booming voice.

needless to say, to this day, if a tall man approaches her or the members of my family she loses her shit. when it came to integrating family members or getting a roommate, it was hard. she would aggressively bark with her hackles raised, standing protectively at a female's side and you would have to forcibly remove her from the room or else roxy would stress herself out horribly.

with daily, constant stimulation, roxy could warm up to a man in anywhere between two weeks to two months. that being said, my boyfriend would only come over once or twice a week or a few times a month. it was very stressful for both of them. my boyfriend worked with rescue animals at a time and absolutely loves all animals. he's a very gentle soul and he was so sad that roxy was so terrified.

however...my boyfriend is a 6'4"" bearded white male with a deep, booming voice.

six months pass.

two weeks ago she stopped barking at him constantly and would only bark if he moved around the room or stood up. last week she started brushing past him and even sitting near us without making a sound.

this morning? she ran up to him, sat in front of him, and stared at him. i told bf to command her to give him a high-five, and she did so happily. then.... she bumped her nose into his hand and for the first time since my boyfriend and i started dating she allowed him to pet her and melted into his arms. she's never let him pet her before. i was all waterworks.

"my (f30) fiance (m40) is going on a trip with his friend (f27) for his bachelor party. my jealousy ruins every happy feeling towards the wedding.. (please read my edits in the bottom)

ok, so my fiance has just one good friend and that is a girl he met through work about 7 years ago. (we have been together 3 years) there has never been any romantic feelings between them and i believe him because when i see them together they display a very sibling-like relationship. 

he proposed to me in september and we are getting married in may. and because he only has this one good friend, she became his best man. and she has planned an overnight trip to a city with a stay at a hotel. they are going to sleep in the same room, probably even in the same bed and i'm finding myself becoming very jealous, so much so that i want to cancel the whole wedding.. and i hate that i feel this way, because i know they would never do anything wrong. 

i think the problem is a few different things:
1. my fiance is not very fond of traveling or doing something new. so it's rare for us to go on such trips and i become selfish and would have liked for us to go together instead. 

2. she is much more pretty, funny and have a lot more self confidence than me. so i'm afraid that a trip with her would remind him of the ugly, depressed and boring girl he has waiting at home. 

3. and even though i'n not afraid that he will have an affair with her, it's still painfull knowing he will be that close to another girl. 

i work really hard with myself and my negative thoughts every day, but this is just too much. 

could someone give me a virtual slap in the face? 
i just want to feel some joy about my own wedding. :(

edit: i have told him that shared room is ok, but that i'm not ok with shared bed. i don't want to lay down a lot of rules for him. i'm not his boss and i trust him/them. and he has agreed to theese terms. 
but oh my god, these few weeks until that trip will be hard nevertheless.

edit 2: okay, thanks to all of the replies i got from you guys i sat down with my fiance and told him about how upset this made me. i said that i would not deny him anything but i made it clear that this was hard for me. 
he got very affectionate and said that he did not want me to be upset. he is going to talk to his friend and tell her that he will not spend the night with her. the bachelor trip will have to be a day-trip without a sleepover. 
so he respected my feelings and made a compromise that made me feel much better! :) just a reminder to myself about what a nice man i'm marrying.",7
"i enjoy the feeling of body parts ""falling asleep"". you know how when you sit on the toilet to long and your leg will fall asleep? or if you rest your arm weirdly it will fall asleep? i really enjoy that feeling.

the tingling feels really nice, like a mixture of pin pricks and tickling, or (i'd guess) soaking your feet in carbonated water without the wetness.

when you walk or touch the body part that's asleep, it's super sensitive. it's kind of like the feeling of nutting, but completely non-sexual. walking slowly with a leg asleep is one of the most pleasant feelings ever.

"if you think your anxiety/depression isn't that bad, it is.. i 22m have dealt with anxiety and depression since i was 12. i have never ever saw a therapist or took antidepressants and i was a mess. i harmed myself multiple times. i isolated myself in the dark. i had no friends. i would cry every single day. i used to do everything in my power to make this disease stronger. everything.

now, a year ago i was a senior in college. i lost my girlfriend at that time. i had a corporate job setup for after college (which is now present day) and i just was so stressed out with school. i isolated isolated isolated, cried cried cried, harmed harmed harmed. i was a anxiety freak over everything. i didn't do anything but just get scared of all that's around me. now, here's the thing. i thought my anxiety and depression weren't ""that bad."" i thought that everyone around me was ""over exaggerating"" or ""manipulating me and against me."" 

when i saw a therapist, that all went away. that all. went. away. my anxiety truly was the worst, and i think everyday about how horrible i was. it made me a different person. now, a year later, without anxiety and depression, i can tell you honestly that it was extremely terrible.

if you have anxiety or depression and think it ""isn't that bad,"" then i urge you to see somebody. that's what prevented me from going to a therapist, because i thought i didn't need one. it's crazy to think sometimes what our minds try to do to us. as if our behaviors are normal when deep down inside they arent. my anxiety and depression were definitely bad, and it takes a lot to admit it. look at your surroundings next time, and make a list of your reality vs what you want you're reality to be. then you'll see how bad it is. my actual reality was so different from where i thought my reality was. stop imagining alternate realities, and make on of those alternate realities your truth. stop downplaying your depression and seek help. we're all here for you.",11
"killed my neighbor's dog update. original here
(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3buv0v/neighbors_dog_killed_my_goats_i_killed_it_now_he/)

this all happened several months ago and it did get a bit exciting so i figured i would update as y'all seem keen on those.

short story: i got more than i originally asked for.

long story: neighbor got drunk and tried to drive his truck through my house (presumably. he hit a tree instead). tree fell over onto my roof and destroyed it as well as quite a few electronics in the room under where the tree hit as it was raining quite hard at the time. neighbor ended up with a broken leg, rib and arm. i got home a while after all this happened and found him still in his truck so i called an ambulance and sat there to make sure he wasn't going to die or try to do more damage. anyway after it was all said and done his insurance wrote me a very large check for the roof and electronics and i got a court judgement for nearly what i was asking ($4500) for the goats and damage to the fence. i'm currently in talks with another lawyer to find out what it will take to get the tree replaced.

and the neighbor moved away. don't know if it's just because he thinks i ruined his life or if he just sold his house to cover his costs. frankly, i don't care. i just want him far away from me.",2

"i grew up in a far-right military family believing the us was by far the best place to live. after travel, i learned i was very wrong. i spent the last few weeks traveling around europe. i won't get into the details since that's more suited for a travel forum but needless to say it was one of the best decisions i ever made and it was the first time i left the us. 

i have a great job with lots of vacation time saved up, and a woman i love who is in similar circumstances. she's more of a free-spirit than i am and she wanted to spend our planned vacation going from town to town in europe while i was content spending a weekend away at a nearby beach. she won. 

i grew up believing the us was perfect in about every aspect. i'm not military much to my dad's disappointment but he was along with both of my grandfathers. we were told to love reagan, we had flags, we stood proudly during the anthem during the sporting events, we supported the iraq war 100%, and my father thinks the nfl is a traitorous organization. anything that questions american superiority should be silenced right away, blah blah. i just kind of grew up thinking the same thing though not as strongly. i seriously believed pretty much every other place on the planet is a bit of a shithole and i'm living the best life any human can. 

i know i was on vacation and that provides a different perspective on life than a resident, but getting to know people outside of the us on a personal level and how they live, i can't say for sure anymore the us is ""#1"" anymore. i've seen cultures not driven by excess and greed, not succumbing to obesity and stress at an early age, who believe that the group is stronger than the individual. i've seen impressive infrastructure, what can happen when the governments work for the people. i'd much rather be able to read a few chapters on a train to work than be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for 90 minutes a day. when i went through borders and security at train stations and airports i wasn't treated like a potential criminal like the tsa but i was treated like a human. countries outside the free travel zone let us enter their country with a quick check, but when i was entering my own country i had to fill out a long two-page form and get asked about ten questions by a border security guy just drooling to bust someone for committing a minor crime. 

i was told by my family visiting europe was a mistake. they spewed some talking points fed to them by people with an agenda. they thought i'd be murdered due to all this sudden and rampant crime over there. they wanted me to be very careful in london, a city they believe you can't go out in after dark (beautiful city, lovely people, never once felt unsafe). sadly i bought into their warnings and when i first arrived i was on edge, but very shortly after i relaxed and so glad i did. 

i can't imagine those places are perfect, no place is perfect. i do think overall quite a few of the places we visited offers a higher quality of life than i maintain in the us and i'm considered to be pretty successful by us standards. ",11
"beware other ally bank users. recently my bank card was somehow comprised and charged a penny in oregon. i'm in central california. during the compromise i recieved 1 legitimate phone call from ally asking me to confirm that i didnt make the charge and that my card would be disabled and to call back to get a new card issued. 

i forgot to call back quickly since i was at work when it happened. late that evening maybe 8:30 or 9pm i got a call from ally bank under the caller id i set up. asked me about the compromise and needed to confirm the charges were mine and if they were that they would be charged to my account. the woman on the phone worded it strangely and i had her repeat it to me several times. she also said we are on a secure line and that the call is being recorded about 5 times in the first minute of the phone call which i thought was strange. she then began to throw out numerous large dollar amount charges at major retailers that had been declined. this got my heart beating hard. she continued to say over and over that this is a secured line and is being recorded. after saying none of that was mine asked me to confirm my identity with my online banking username. that's when it clicked for me. never had ally used my online banking id to confirm identity. she insisted it was a new update to their systems. i refused to give it out and said i would call back to ally myself. she told me that's unnecessary and that again this is a secured and recorded line and she already has all my information in front of her. told me to look at the caller id and how it is the official ally number. the way she insisted me not to end the call really made it clear this was a scam call. she kept trying to call me maybe 5+ times while i was waiting to get someone at ally on the phone.

"final update: the fiance (33) of my mom (34) raped my sister (14).. a lot has happened in the past few days and i'll try to explain what i can.

on thursday last week, i decided to tell my stepfather (my sisters' biological father) about the situation. he made the right call and contacted dcf while i was at work, and they sent a social worker over. once my shift finished, i went outside to wait for my mom. at this point, i didn't know a social worker was at the house, and was curious why she was taking so long. 

after about 10 minutes, she pulls up really fast in the parking spot, almost hitting me. i get up quickly and she tells my 12 year old sister to stay in the car. she starts walking towards me and asks ""what the fuck were you thinking?"". from then on, all i heard was just a flurry of insults from my mother as she described how horrible of a person i was and how i was going to ruin their lives. she personally blamed me for all of the upcoming hardships they were going to have, and how i would likely be the cause of kyle commiting suicide. she tells me i'm not going to tell the social worker anything at all. a few minutes later, kyle starts texting my mom, apparently saying his goodbyes. i didn't know this at the time, but apparently he's had a gun with bullets all this time. my mom starts breaking down and tries to text and call him, but she gets no response. she got in the car and started slamming her head against the steering wheel, asking ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"" and ""how could you do this to us?"". she then blames me for his death, and yells at me to ""get the fuck in the car."" by the point, my 12 year old sister is crying and i'm frozen in fear, and oblige.

the ride home, which normally takes 10 minutes, took closer to five. she was speeding and driving erratically, continuing to berate me the entire way home. she states that she has nothing to live for now, and she should just kill herself too. this just makes my sister bawling, and she starts begging my mom not to do it. about halfway, i assume she got a text from kyle, and started calming down and told my sister to wipe away her tears for the social worker. i was texting my dad the whole time and relaying info to him, all the while he was on the phone with the social worker. we pull up to my house and i see the social worker's car parked on the driveway. as we pull in, my mom makes me promise not to say anything, and to play dumb. i make the promise, knowing full well i'm gonna break it in the next minute.

the social worker tells me that she received a report that sexual abuse had occurred at the house. i start telling her the story, but she then tells me to wait, as she requested a police officer to come on scene and she doesn't want me repeating myself. once he shows up, i tell both of them what had happened, and i see more cops arriving on scene. i tell them that kyle has a gun with ammo, and who resides in the house and where they are so they can get everyone out safely. once they get things going, i ask if i can be taken away from the house while this happens to talk more with the social worker, and she obliges, taking me down the road in her car. i give her the full story, and she reassures me it was the right thing to do, and that it was brave. a couple police officers also come by the car and tell me the same thing.

a couple hours later, a detective arrives at the scene and brings me into his car to record my explanation of the entire situation. i swear under oath that everything i say is true and it goes by smoothly. i also provide them the pictures i've taken of the evidence, and let them know that the phone with the audio is inside. later that night, the cops start bringing our backpacks (which are then filled with clothes) to the social worker's car. not too long after that, my dad pulls up with his wife in their car. he said he was proud of me for what i'd done. my sisters are also released to us, and we are told to meet up at a nearby gas station for more questioning. 

the night lasts a long while. by the time we get done with all the questions, it was around 5 am, and i got some much needed sleep at my dad's house. as of right now, my sisters and i are finishing our last week of school, and we're living with our dad until further notice. there is a legal no contact order for two weeks between us and our mom and kyle, or any 2nd or 3rd parties. 

we are safe, and i'm glad for that fact. the court should be making a decision soon, and we should be going to grab our things later on.",7

"for wanting to cut my best friend out of my life for stealing my baby name?. 
to start things off, i'm not pregnant. nor am i anywhere near close to being pregnant. however, my best friend is pregnant and i couldn't be more happy for her. as best friends do, we started discussing baby names. she asked me if i had any baby names picked out for my future children and i told her my mother had suggested a name years ago for my future daughter that i absolutely fell in love with. it's super unique and it's a name that originates from the country she was born in. my mother is no longer alive, so this is something i really wanted to do in the future so my potential daughter could have a connection to her grandmother. 
a few days ago, i saw on facebook that my best friend posted a picture of those 3d sonograms and in the post she revealed the name that she had picked for her daughter. it was the name i told her that i had picked out for my future daughter. i am absolutely devastated she would do this to me. she knows what that name meant to me and she decided to use it anyway. she says it's just a name and since she's pregnant before me she gets to use whatever name she wants. i told her she's being heartless and asked her how she can do this to someone she sees as a sister. she is not going to change her mind about this, so i want to end all communication with her since i can't even imagine calling her daughter by the name i wanted for mine. am i the asshole for doing this?

edit 2: wow, i just finished work and i honestly didn't think this post would blow up this much. thank you to everyone who took the time to comment, regardless of your opinion on this post. my friend hasn't reached out to me since the last time we spoke, but i'm honestly over it all and don't want to continue our friendship. if there is an update to the situation, i'll be sure to post about it.

ps- i won't be sharing the name on here or in a private message. i learned my lesson the last time.",3
"sorry guys, i can't keep doing this.. as a background, i am a 29 year old married man who made some terrible financial decisions that left me with a large student loan, high car payments, 26k in medical debt, and several thousand in credit card debt.

for the last few years, my wife and i have employed the hardcore mindset of personalfinance:  have an emergency fund, put every dime you have towards debt, and grind until it's gone.  i took this to heart.  we have a decent savings, we nearly eliminated our entertainment budget(thanks netflix!), i got in shape, we made money on the side(working the flea every weekend), and we made slow but steady progress.

i am proud to say that as of last month, i have completely eliminated all my short-term debts.  my car, my medical debt, all my credit card debt, is officially at zero. 

however, i still have 86k in student loans.  i am now almost 30, married, and living in an apartment.  

after all my bills(including rent/student loans) my wife an i have a monthly surplus of 2.5k usd.  

i know the right thing is to continue putting every dime i have left over into student loans, but i can't do it anymore.  for the last several years our lives have been putting every cent i have towards debt.  it's been painful and boring, and the only thing that kept me going is the joy of seeing those debts get knocked off one by one.  all free time has been netflix, gaming, and working the flea market on weekends to pay off this debt.

after several years, i am tired, stressed, and feel like my life is going nowhere. i have been a slave to the results of my bad decisions and debt.  all my student loans add up to $600/month.  i can live with $600/month of my salary going to student loans, but i can't live the next three years of my life in this shitty apartment putting my dreams of a house and family/kids on hold.

i've done my budget a hundred times.  we can have a modest house and still have a monthly surplus of $1800.  we have a modest savings to cover any large expenses.  we have enough to cover overages, save, and put money towards the house to pay it off a decade early.  having a kid will take some compromising, but another 3 years of my life is just not worth $600/month.

i know am making the wrong decision financially, but i believe i am making the right decision for my sanity.  i don't know if i'm looking for reassurance that i am doing the right thing or need a new perspective, but it feels good to vent.

edit:  i just wanted to say thank you to everyone to responded and offered advice.  i tried to respond to everyone in the beginning, but it was overwhelming in a good way.  thank you again to everyone, and i believe i am making the right decision to move forward with the house plans.

thank you again, it is much appreciated and means a lot.",10

as i was applying the cream to her upper thigh she shifted her body because of the pain, and my fingers slipped and one entered her vagina, i was shocked and took about half a second to remove it as was a bit taken aback, i apologised about 20 times.doris just looked at me with a big smile and said, ""don't worry dear, it happens"" then chuckled and said ""it's been a while""i must have washed my hands about 30 times and questioned my career choice, colleagues thought it was hilarious.next day an old man in a hoist shit on my converse and it soaked through to my sock... i realised i wasn't cut out for this job and handed my notice in there and then.

"by being a good dad to my daughter. the was last night, not this morning.  

as i do most nights, i check on my kids just before turning in myself. my daughter seemed a little restless, but nothing out of the unusual. as i was leaving her room, though, i heard her mutter something. she often just says sweet things like, ""i love you, dad"" or sometimes she talks in her sleep. either way i usually listen in. so i paused at the door and asked, ""did you say something?"" another mutter and she rolled to her side. i knelt down beside her (she has been opting to sleep on the floor lately). this time she growled a bit and her dinner of hotdogs, carrot sticks, and orange juice made a quick exit onto her blankets, hair, and stuffed animal collection. i sat her up and was rubbing her back reassuringly and she finished coating the remaining blankets and sleeping bag with what seemed like an endless supply of orange liquidy pulp. an hour an a half later we were finally getting her back to bed after a shower and a few more sessions of upchuck/cleanup/rinse & repeat. the 3 other garbage bags of laundry that didn't immediately fit in the washing machine would have to wait until morning. 

""where's the proverbial fu?"" you're asking. it's right here. see, as a dad, i like to be prepared and protect and provide for my family should situations arise when i can make life a little more comfortable in hairy situations. i'm also fairly pragmatic in that if i can avoid or mitigate the effects of a disaster i will. that being said, i'm prepared for most emergencies. i've got several boxes of gear with duct tape, batteries, rope, tie downs, flashlights, toilet paper, etc.. they've come in handy before and undoubtedly they'll come in handy again. 

being an avid reader of all things reddit, i remember from a lifeprotip post that you can help vomiting kids find the target they're aiming for by placing a glow stick in the bottom of the garbage can. well, this summer's camping trip used up all the little kid glow stick bracelets. no worries, über dad has got you covered. i'll just dig into my disaster prep stash and break out the beefy, industrial glow sticks. now what i didn't realize was that these particular glow sticks had been subjected to some pretty intense west coast heat for the last few summers. the worst thing that could happen was they no longer worked. wrong.

heading through the living room i soon found out that the components inside the stick work great. the structural integrity of the plastic stick, however, had become brittle with age and temperature fluctuations. as i bent the glowstick, the plastic immediately burst spewing forth a shower of luminescent liquid. absolutely everywhere. it hit the ceiling, the walls, full bookcases, the shoe rack, the furniture, the carpet, and the blinds. everything within a 15 foot reach was coated in a bright, neon green spray pattern that would enthrall dexter morgan if he used luminol and blacklighting. for just an instant, i seriously felt like carl sagan leaving my comfortable living room and stepping into a magical place with ""billions and billions of stars."" then reality immediately crashed back in on me when i realized that not only did i spray luminous, oily glow juice everywhere, but also flung the broken, thin glass shards from the capsules inside those sticks. so began another hour plus round of cleaning and glass shard hunting at zero dark thirty.

tldr: read a lpt about putting glowsticks in sick buckets, ended up creating a mini-universe in my living room.

"by eating a 7 million scoville unit hot sauce infused spaghetti and going down on my wife.. i had a large group of people over that were hungry and were self-proclaimed, ""chili-heads."" i doubted their true understanding of the level of hot sauce i had and gave them a stern warning of what was to come. yet, one girl, with venezuelan heritage claimed she could take any level of heat. well, i cooked up a batch of spaghetti and put a liberal amount of ""the source"" hot sauce - google it to see just how hot this compares to most ""spicy"" things. i served my guests, with another strong warning that it was going to be hell for some, but alas they were all willing. i too would partake in dinner as well, as my palate had become accustom to this sauce and it wasn't too bad for me anymore and was a prerequisite for them to do it as well.

&#x200b;

fast forward about 5 to 10 minutes and everyone is losing their collective shit. people holding their mouths under the sink, pounding beer to soothe the pain, and our miss venezuela in a ball on the ground crying. i consoled her the best i could and offered some remedy techniques. all the while, i'm quietly laughing with my now wife (she didn't partake, smart).

&#x200b;

i wait another 2 hours to make sure no one needs to go to the hospital... we're good, most have have calmed down and are feeling a little better, including a much more humbled venezuelan girl. myself, i consume a bunch of crackers and wash my mouth out with plenty of water and booze. now, high on endorphins and, well, booze. i'm feeling like i want to get into some sexy times. my wife and i retire upstairs where we immediately start getting naughty.

&#x200b;

i go down on her and she's enjoying it, well initially. she starts to make weird noises and i ask if everything's ok, to which she replies, ""it, it just feels weird,"" but insists that i continue. another 5 minutes pass and she completely stops me, ""ok, something wrong it just feels really weird."" i comply and think nothing of it in my inebriated state, so we transition to having sex. of course, i'm enjoying myself and getting into it, man it's really sensitive right now - i think to myself, i'm tingling with excitement! huh, wait, it's now starting to burn a little. my mind's racing what could be wrong, then it hits me. ""oh shit, the fucking source!"" i exclaimed to her. we both jump off and start paying close attention to our genitals. pain building and for some reason, my johnson is starting to really hurt. i'm pacing back and forth, holding my sneaky pete in front of the fan, doing anything i can to relieve the pain. my wife clutching her vaheyhey like she's about to give birth.

&#x200b;

10 minutes pass and i'm finding absolutely no relief, but my wife for some reason is taking it like a champ. i start to panic, as i'm really burning up, downstairs. i run into the bathroom and start slashing water from the sink on my nixon. brief relief, followed by immediate pain. fuck. finally i say screw this shit: i fill up the sink to the brim and lay face first on the counter with my twig and berries fully submerged in this life-saving water. i stay in that position for a good 20 minutes. finally i retract my stanley steamer from this holy water. ahhhhhhhh, the pain has finally subsided enough to return to bed. i regaled my wife of my fateful bathroom story and we laugh for a good 20 minutes. needless to say, we waited a good day for the fire to completely snuff out until we got frisky again.

"for telling my wife i will divorce her if she continues to try to raise our son as muslim?. me and my wife have been married two years. she is from an immigrant family, who are fundamentalist muslims. i am pretty much an athiest, and when we met she was of the same mind, perhaps agnostic is the better word. she continued to put on a front for her muslim father.

her family does not like me, because i am a white guy who comes from a christian home. that is the fact of the matter, they have said as much on social media.

my wife lives with me. we agreed if we have kids they would be raised secular, if they want to choose to be muslim when theyre old, thats fine, but i do not care for the religion and dont want it drilled into them. she agreed and i would not have kids otherwise. her family did not show up to our wedding.

now that our son has been born, her family keeps pressuring to see my son and take him to their mosque. i refused and she agreed, but now i found out her father took my son there and dressed him in muslim clothes without my knowledge.

so im not good enough for your daughter because im white, but my half white son youre going to raise against my wishes? no sir. my father in law has a gross control over my wife.

she is so happy when we can be in our home together and just be ourselves, have glasses of wine, eat whatever we want, wear whatever we want. when she sees her father she comes back depressed and ashamed.

he is pressuring her to be a muslim or a half muslim, whatever. she is my wife and i love her, but shes an adult and she can do what she wants. however i refuse to let my father in law drill thoughts into my boys head.

he is my son too, and hes a baby. i have told her this many times, but she continues to bring him to my father in law who continues to do religious things with him. my father in law refuses to listen when i tell him not to do this, and ignores me. he acts like i am not the boys father.

i flat out told her i cannot allow my son to be raised that way, even if it meant splitting up.

edit: seems like theres a lot of confusion about my wifes faith and her relationship with her family.. heres a story that might clear things up.

my wife and myself were at the beach. having fun, trying to surf. she was wearing a very sexy two piece bikini. she takes selfies of herself, and posts them online where she thinks her family cant see. harmless fun.

her brother somehow sees, and rudely tells her that shes disgracing her family. not even kidding. i tell him to lay off her, and he threatens to attack me. her brother is 17.

the father not only knew about this, but liked the brothers posts. needless to say my wife ended up in tears and we haven't gone to the beach since. these are her family.

edit 2: post locked which is fine. theres obviously been enough.

to all those pming saying that im a racist troll and that the mods ""exposed"" me, i messaged them and they have no evidence. that is just one mods (incorrect) opinion that they decided to sticky for whatever reason. i told them that it was causing confusion and sending harassment my way, they dont seem to care.

they also muted me for even asking so theres that.

it is simply their opinion, which is fine to have. it is nothing more than that.

"this is not r/ididntdosomethingishouldhavedone. hey r/confession,

recently there have been an exorbitant amount of posts where op tells us they've been wronged in some way (raped, molested as a child, robbed, etc.) but they also tie a small 'confession' to it to make it fit in our sub.  really, though, the post isn't about their confession, rather what someone else did to them. up to now it has been at the discretion of the mod team to keep the post live or not causing these posts to be in a gray area for us. these posts take away from the purpose of this sub, and as such will start getting removed moving forward.  

rule 1 states:

 > 1. all submissions must be a confession.

> **a confession is a statement acknowledging an act of wrongdoing you would ostensibly prefer to keep hidden.** the term presumes that you are providing information that you believe other people in your life are not aware of, and for this sub, associated with an admission of a moral or legal wrong.

> * **your confession must be an act you committed** 

> * a personal preference, opinion, bad or unpopular behavior are not confessions 

> * your sexual exploration is not a confession; it's a part of finding out who you are. /r/confession is not a place for submissions that read like pornography.

the first bullet is key for this reminder.  

also regarding rule number 5... if you missed reddit's formal announcement on their stance on posts involving sexual or suggestive content involving minors(https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive), i encourage you read it. does your confession include sexual activities and at least one party involved was a minor? not only is it not allowed in r/confession, but it's not allowed on all of reddit. do not post it! 

if at any time you find that a post violates one of these rules (or any rules in our sub), please utilize the report button just under their post. this will alert the mod team of the post and one of us will check in on it as soon as we can. 

keep making this community great!

"once upon a time there lived a ravishing queen with huge tits... nick the dragon slayer obsessed over the queen for this reason. he knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try.

without pause nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

the next day, horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the queen's bra while she bathed. soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

upon being summoned to the royal chambers to address this incident, horatio informed the king and queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

the king, eager to help his queen, quickly summoned nick to their chambers. 

horatio then slipped nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, nick worked passionately on the queen's large and magnificent breasts. the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

upon returning to his chamber, nick found horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. with his obsession now satisfied, nick couldn't have cared less knowing that horatio could never report this matter to the king and with a laugh told him to get lost.

the next day, horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the king's underwear. the king immediately summoned nick.

"the best $12/month i ever spent. i'm a recent first time homeowner in a large city. when i started paying my water bill from the city i received what seemed like a predatory advertisement for insurance on my water line for an extra $12 each bill. at first i didn't pay because it seemed like when they offer you purchase protection at best buy, which is a total waste. 

then after a couple years here i was talking to my neighbor about some work being done in the street in front of his house. he said his water line under the street was leaking and even though it's not in his house and he had no water damage, the city said he's responsible for it and it cost him $8000 to fix it because his homeowner's insurance doesn't cover it. 

i immediately signed up for that extra $12/month. well guess what. two years later i have that same problem. the old pipe under the street has broken and even though it has no effect on my property, i'm responsible. but because i have the insurance i won't have to pay anything at all!

what quote from a video game stuck with you?. ,1
"my (35m) wife (35f) nearly died in hospital, her family doesn't care and now i don't know how to act around my in-laws. **tl;dr** – over the summer, we discovered my wife has a rare heart condition and nearly died. three open-heart surgeries, two months in the icu, and being put on the heart transplant list, and her family did little more than check in occasionally. i'm pissed and hurt, but don't know what to do about it.

so here's the story. buckle in, it's long. throwaway because some of her family lives on reddit and will probably see this. if you think this song is about you...

a few weeks before easter, my wife started not feeling well. just breathless and really tired all the time. she went in for some blood work and they discovered she was in heart failure. it went real critical, real fast. we never even celebrated easter—my kid's easter basket, full of dora the explorer toys and candy, is still hidden in the bottom of my closet.

we went from ""nothing's wrong, maybe a mild flu that she can't shake"" to the er at our local hospital, transferred to the city hospital, and being told that we need to get her on the heart transplant list asap. after a month at the city hospital, with me driving an hour there and back with our kid to visit her daily, her family had not bothered to come visit her once. they lived about 30ish minutes away from the city hospital. 

i should stop here and mention that my wife and i are better off financially than the rest of her immediate family. i fully am aware this is because i had a wealthy family, good education, and a great job that lets me work flexible hours and do extra jobs on the side. her family—mother (60s), brother (32), and sister (34)—aren't as well off. mother works at walmart and makes ends meet. brother has a decent job but just in general has trouble keeping his shit together, but he tries. sister is a stay at home mom—they budget well, but don't have a lot of disposable income. 

in the past, i have been the safety net for her family. brother's car breaks down, we've paid to fix it. sister has a health issue, we've paid his medical bills. we've even done some family vacations where we paid for the rental property on the beach and groceries. we never demand repayment (although we accept it when/if they do), and my attitude has always been ""money is just a thing, but family is important."" maybe i felt this way because i didn't have any family left.

that said, i always also thought we'd be ""paid back"" emotionally, if that makes sense? i thought they'd be there for us when we needed it. when my wife first went to the city hospital, i'd drop my kid off at the mother's house in order to visit with wife. mother insisted i didn't need to pay her for babysitting, but after the first week, when it became apparent that my wife wasn't getting better quickly and this was a long term situation, i felt bad just dumping my kid off, and instead kept her with me when i visited. 

the first few weeks, i didn't think anything of the fact that her family didn't come visit, even though they lived a little closer to the city hospital. mother, sister, brother all work (brother with odd hours), and none of them have the best cars (or money for parking, etc.). 

then things got progressively worse. my wife's other organs started failing. we had to speak to palliative care, which freaked me the fuck out. eventually, the city hospital said they couldn't take care of my wife and give her a rare operation, and we'd be transferred to a major hospital 250+ miles away. i called her family and basically said ""if you want to see her before she's transferred—and maybe before she literally dies—come now."" 

they did come that day and stayed with her several hours. i felt like a tool, because it was clear that the mother was upset and kind of freaked out and didn't know how to deal with the idea that her daughter was so sick. 

but also...jfc. it'd been a month at that point, and this was the first time they'd visited her in the hospital. 

after that, wife was transferred by ambulance to the major hospital. she spends another few weeks in icu there, while they get her health up to as good as possible before the first major surgery. me and the kid are living in a trashy motel—we are okay financially, but we can't afford weeks and months at a nice hotel. i'm feeding my kid nuggets out of the motel microwave and dealing with daily visits at the hospital in a city we aren't used to.

it was stressful as fuck, guys. not just seeing my wife, who's only 35 years old, suddenly take a nosedive in health for a rare condition we didn't know she had, but also being the sole provider for my kid and worrying about her mental health as she sees her mom dying. i was torn on how much to let my kid see versus how much to let my wife see my kid... i started taking pictures and thinking about which one would be the last family picture we had together. i talked to the hospital's child psychologist for my kid. 

and also, i did a lot of freelance work, because i knew these bills were coming. my days were: wake up before the kid, sneak out of the motel bed, work, kid wakes up, get her dressed, go to the hospital, come back to the motel, try to find a way to make my kid's day bright and not depressing as fuck, get kid to bed, work until i passed out. 

look guys, i don't want pity or to come off as a whiner, but...i was dealing with a lot in this. and i had no help. my family is either dead or living in a different state. all our friends are in our hometown, not the major hospital city. 

all my wife's family—not just the mother, brother, and sister, but also the aunts, uncles, etc.—live in about the same area. and yeah, that's a 3-4 hour drive from the major city hospital, but at most 45 minutes from the first city hospital, and the only ones who visited her there were the m, b, s, and that was only after i basically begged them to come see her. no one, not one goddamn person, visited her at the major city hospital. not before the first risky surgery, not in the full month of recovery after it. 

not. 

one.

goddamn.

person.

she's been in hospitals for about three months now. she's spent most of that time in icu. she's had three open heart surgeries, and is coming home with implants and drugs and basically a whole new handicapped life.

and her family doesn't give a shit. 

after she had the last surgery, she mentioned, in a very quiet, sad voice, ""do you think anyone else is going to come up and visit me?""

my heart fucking broke. as soon as i left her room, i texted her whole family—all of them, not just her immediate fam. i offered my wife's car for them to drive. i offered money for gas and food. i offered to pay for them to stay overnight at the hotel. 

the mother and brother both said they'd come up, just needed to get time off work. 

spoiler: they never came. 

the sister said she was planning to come up in a few weeks. 

spoiler: that was last week and she didn't come. 

they all had excuses. 

but jfc. three months in the hospital. one visit—after i guilted and begged, and only because it was at the closer hospital.

as for the rest of her extended family, i also sent them all the information on this program the major city hospital does, where you can basically send an email to the hospital, and they print it up and make it look like a card. literally as simple as a fucking email, and guess how many of them did it? one cousin—the one member of her extended family that lives on the opposite side of the country. 

no one else could even be arsed enough to send a fucking ""get well soon"" email.

meanwhile, my friends called and offered help. i had one friend drive two hours to spend a day with my kid so she could have a break. college buddies i've not seen in years saw my facebook post and sent me $100 gift cards or gift cards to meal delivery and stuff. i say this because (a) it's not like i was being secret about how grave the situation was, and (b) any normal human being could see this is one of those situations where we need help. and while yes, the money helped, what we really needed was fucking emotional support or something. 

now before it sounds like we're in a victor hugo novel, i should say that her family has a facebook messenger chat thing, and they did keep up with her there. so i guess i can't say they didn't care, but...

idk, am i being an asshole about this? i realize that they have jobs that aren't as flexible as mine, but three months. major surgeries. she nearly fucking died. 

and they didn't come visit. they didn't even send a fucking email. 

and i saw the way she was hurt. i saw the hope fade from her eyes when she thought her mom was coming, and then she didn't. 

and i saw my kid, dragged from hospital to motel and back again, because i didn't have any help with her in the other city. wife's sister was going to bring her kids up so that my kid could spend some time with them at the motel pool and she could visit with my wife. my kid cried when she found out her cousins weren't coming. it was the only thing she had to look forward literally this whole summer---one day where she could have fun, and my wife's sister didn't come.

i always thought to myself that it didn't matter if i loaned out money or whatever to my wife's family because i could always count on them to be there for us when we needed it. 

we needed it. 

and they weren't there.

and now...i don't know how to react or deal with them. because every time i think of them, i'm filled with rage and resentment. 

but...my kid loves them. and my wife loves them. and they're more important in this situation. i'm ready to salt the earth with these fuck ups, but my wife is recovering from a major illness and it's not like she needs drama. and i don't have family left on my side, and don't want my kid to be alone. 

so, reddit hive mind...what should i do? i can swallow my own emotions and play nice around her family. now that my wife is coming home soon, they all want to visit (on their sweet time, at our house—basically, now that it's not inconvenient any more). and she's happy, so i'm not saying anything. i know she's hurt by the way they didn't bother with her, but i don't feel like it's my place to put it into words: your family is shit, and they just proved it. 

so i guess i'm at a point where i feel like i just have to grin and bear it. maybe in the future, i'll excuse myself from being around them. i know i'm not going to be there financially for them unless it's a life or death situation. but is there a better way to act, or something else i should do? should i bring this up to my wife--ever?",7

"ca/tx my brother, who i have not seen in 8 years, and who is a minor showed up at my doorstep.. hello everyone, 
i am a 26f.  about 8 years ago, when i turned 18, i ran away from my home in rural texas.  my parents are extremely conservative christians.  while they were not physically abusive, they did not allow me to go to any college because ""education is not for woman.""  my bf, now husband, sent me money in cash and i got a po box and ran away.  i have not seen, heard, or talked to them ever since.  before i left, i told my brother, who was 8 at the time, my bf's landline number and a code word to identify himself (in retrospect i was 18 and immature and i felt cool running away).  i told my brother to use the landline only in the most extreme circumstances.

yesterday morning my brother, now 16 showed up at my doorstep.  to say i was shocked would be an understatement.  he paid someone to look up my address on a website when he was in texas.  the way he ran away is similar to mine.  his ""friend"" (i suspect it is his friend, but he appears to have a crush on him) sent him cash money he then used to buy an airplane ticket.

the reason he gave for running away was that he was gay.  my parents frequently are homophobic.  they also say that gay people should be going to conversion camps.   although he won't admit it, i suspect my brother may have depression.  at this point i don't know what to do legally.  i suspect that my parents may have filed a missing complaint, but i am not sure.  i haven't received any calls from the police or any visits from them.  so here are some questions.

1) am i under any legal obligation to contact my parents letting them know where he is?  is it illegal to not do so?  i have no desire to talk to them.

2) am i under any legal obligation to tell the police where he is?  is it illegal to not contact them?

3) i know the chance is almost close to zero of my getting any sort of guardianship of him, but does planning to send a child to a conversion camp that has led to the suicides of my brother's two friends constitute child abuse?  does it constitute child abuse in california?  does it constitute child abuse in texas?  

4) in the most negative scenario, under which my brother is forced to return to texas and then forced to go to a conversion camp, what can he do to protect himself physically and mentally?

5) does telling a child constantly that he will go to hell because he is a ""sodomite"" and he is a ""pedophile"" constitute emotional abuse such that cps could reasonably place him in another home?  does talking about conversion camp constitute emotional abuse?

edit: side note, the friend who sent him the money is someone i know.  i know him because i use to tutor him in the homework program at the local library.",2

i went to the music shop to pick out a cd for him instead but i wasnt sure which one to get.  i didnt get him a present. the next day hes upset because i didnt get him a present or even a card for his birthday. i feel terrible but he told me not to get him anything.

"weed absolutely can be addicting and have negative consequences so it should not be represented as wonderfully as it is in the legalization movement. i was a smoker/stoner for about the last 5 years and i can honestly say that i really struggled to quit and i still relapse from time to time. it was my go-to way to ""relax"" and ""have a good time"" but it allowed me to take the easy way out instead of finding other opportunities for hobbies or time with friends and family or meeting new people. as a result i find myself craving that escape from 'normal' life and i don't have the skills to find something enjoyable to do on an uneventful evening. i want to smoke so bad but i know for me personally it makes me lazier and a less productive employee. at this point i really do feel like i'm recovering from an addiction.

weed was also my 'gateway drug' as ridiculous as that claim seems to be for many people. i would never have considered other drugs until i felt how good it was to be high.

but the legalization movement characterizes weed as this wonderful thing that was wrongly made illegal. they seldom talk about these negative consequences to life and make it seem like nothing is bad about it.

that being said, i think it should be legal, we just need to respect it as the drug that it is and be clear that it is not for everyone and can cause harm to peoples lives. for some it is truly a live saving medicinal drug, so it should definitely be available to these people. but focusing the legalization effort on how much it does for people with difficult medical conditions paints weed in a much better light than it should be for the general population. 

sorry for the rant i just had to get this out there.

tl;dr: weed can be harmful for many people's lives so it should not be portrayed as this wonderful thing for society as legalization takes off.

"by trying to teach my daughters about savings, now i may need a chocolate coins bailout. well, not exactly today. this started back in june, but it's only just now that i realize how deep i am and the evil little mogul i have created.

i'm a single dad from mexico. and every opportunity i get to teach my daughters (5 and 3) something i try to take it. and it works amazing if you put a fun little twist into it, which usually means sugar or pepperoni pizza.

now, my daughters get an allowance from me. it's a small amount, enough to get a little something from the school's cafeteria (privately owned) and then some to ""save"", which they never do of course. one night i was doing some shopping since they were staying with me for the whole month of june, and being the awesome dad that i am i needed to get the cutest unicorn pajamas i could find, marshmallows and whatever bag that contained the word ""candy"" on it in the whole store. that's when i saw chocolate coins, you know these ones(https://i.imgur.com/gvflt3t.png). so i immediately thought i could turn this into a learning experience while at the same time being their hero for giving them chocolate.

here's my thought. i'll give each of them 5 chocolate coins every monday. they can either eat them or save them as they wish. but whatever amount of coins they had remaining by next monday morning i'd take as ""savings"" and i'd give them their 5 new ones for the week plus 50% of the total amount as a bonus. so if one of them had 2 coins remaining then she'd get 5 more on monday morning, making it 7, i'd take that and add 50% more (3.5, rounds up to 4) so that girl would then have 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 coins. by just saving 2! but they wouldn't get any bonus if they saved just 1 or none. here's where people who are good at math are starting to get where this is going... but it's even worse.

the little one ate all of her coins that very first monday. i don't think she even took the wrapper off. the big one lasted until friday. weekends are rough man, you need your chocolate coins to relax. next monday i give them their 5 coins but this time they only got to eat 2 maximum a day (i needed to step in with some regulations, sue me!). by tuesday my parents come visit and the kids want to go with them and spend the night, so of course i said yes and off they went, leaving their coins behind. one night turned into 5 actually, and they came back on sunday to their 4 and 3 coins each.

""thank god my parents helped me or this would've never even worked"", i thought. they'll finally reap some rewards and maybe learn the lesson here. the big one eats only 1 coin and keeps 3. the little one eats her maximum amount allowed, of course, and keeps 1. next morning they get a big surprise.

big one gets 5 coins, saved 2, gets 4 as a bonus, so ends up with 11.

little one gets her 5 coins, saved 1, no bonus. ends up with 6.

i then saw it. my older daughter's eyes turned black and i swear i could see sweatshops filled with 5 year olds working for her while she laughs maniacally. she's up to something, i just know! and boy was i right.

that monday they started a bit of summer school. they get to see their classmates for 2 hours a day and do some random activity, the big one brings her coins for some reason, and at some point i swear i saw her smirk at me on the mirror, as if she was warning me i'd get stabbed 20 times from behind with a plastic retractile knife to cut fake vegetables with.

we get there, dropped them off and left to do some shopping. when i came back for them i noticed my daughter's coin bag was empty (remember, 2 a day max) so i asked her what happened. she smiles and says ""i sold them"", ""what do you mean you sold them?"", ""yup, they gave me real coins for them"". i was proud. i have an entrepreneur! (or the reincarnation of genghis khan, not sure yet). i asked how much she got and it comes out exactly at $44 pesos, $4 for every coin. which is about $2.2 us dollars. she actually made a profit. i buy the coins bags at the candy shop and they cost me almost exactly $1 peso per coin, she got $4 each!. here's where it all goes down hill.

we get home and she asks if we can go to the store. little convenience store owned by the neighborhood's grandpa. i agree and we go. she gives the old man her whole $44 pesos and asks for nothing but chocolate coins. grandpa has to make a profit off the damn things of course, so he sells them at $2 pesos each. that means my daughter sold 11 coins and with that money she's getting 22, double the amount! i just hope she doesn't find out i outsource my product or i'll be in trouble.

i'm so proud of her, she's making a profit and she's even outsmarting me. by friday she has already sold 96 coins, all the while eating her 2 coins a day and even keeping some money since she's only investing on 20 coins a day at grandpa's store (parents noticed and some didn't like the little shits buying 400% price inflated chocolate from her, but she kept some regulars).

yesterday was a monday. my daughter had 274 coins. i gave her 5. and 50% of that total was 140 more. she has 419 now. she doesn't even need to buy coins anymore, i'm her provider and i'm doing it for free... i need a bailout.

tl;dr - i thought about teaching my daughters the importance of savings, but i instead learned some people will take advantage of everybody, and some are happy just eating some chocolate.

"for refusing to adopt my wife's two kids after discovering who the real father is?. i am a 35 years old guy, and i was lucky enough to marry my crush (27f) two years ago. we met at work, where she was a receptionist for the big building my company is in. anyways, she has two daughters, 6 and 7 years old.

when i married my wife, i was a bit iffy at the idea of being a dad so fast and so suddenly to two kids that aren't mine, but i love my wife so much i am willing to sacrifice my man-time and a portion of my salary to take care of the kids.

to be honest, i've had my ups and downs with them (you know, kids) and sometimes i think i'd be happier going back to my ""lone wolf"" life. but i fully know that this is my life now and i try my best to suck it up and do what i signed up for.

back to the story: i know the kids dad had died only from my wife's words and i've never had reason to doubt that.

it has been two or three months since she started convincing me that i should adopt them as a birthday gift for both of them (their birthday happens in two consecutive days, coincidence). i'd be fine with that, it's just paper for what i would do anyways.

i agreed to that and she said she'd get on with the documents. well fantastic! i thought. i like not having to do anything. what really got me suspicious is how she changed her behaviour with her phone and laptop. she started putting the phone face down, and she created a totally different user for her laptop she switches to when she's with me.

i thought she was cheating so i did what every scumbag like me would do, i spied on her. long story short, i come to know by a very reliable source that…. her ex-husband isn't paying alimony anymore as he is in jail with no money to his account. the world crushed on me. first i thought the guy was dead, now i discover he is alive, paying alimony to my wife's bank account while i was financially providing too.

i confronted my wife and she didn't deny any of it. she started crying and she was adamant that she did that only for the kids' well being. she was putting the alimony money he ex was giving her into an account for when the kids will be 18 yo (i have no proof of that). she also said that it was a while since she felt i should adopt them, as they love me and they look up to me. she was firm about stating that nothing happened with her ex husband while she was with me. she said that her ex is ""dead"" for her by all means. she admitted that she lied, but for good purposes - as she was scared that a guy like me would be scared by her reckless past. that's not who she is anymore, as she is focused on family and on us.

now, i need to find out more about her ex-husband that's for sure. i am also furious with my wife for not trusting me enough to come clean about her past. meanwhile, will i be an asshole if i refuse to adopt the kids (they have a dad and he's alive!) and if i state that i will retract from them all the financial support in case i decide to get a divorce?

"for calling 911 on a friend for drunk driving?. i've officially been booted from my social circle and flamed by all my friends. we are all military families with young children and we have get togethers every weekend which includes booze.

one of my friends will drive home, with her 4 month old in tow, drunk. she insists her house is too close to uber and refuses rides from the rest of us. her husband is trashed too. 

granted, she only lives 15 minutes away, but that's 15 minutes after shots and beer pong, sometimes stumbling and throwing up. 

last friday, she was almost blackout drunk. she tried to bring my dog home instead of her own kid. her husband loaded their baby up and they were slurring as they drove away. i insisted they stay overnight but apparently their baby can't sleep anywhere but her own crib. i offered to drive and they kept saying no. my husband thinks it's not a big deal and all my friends kept telling me to chill, their house is so close by.

i picked up the phone and called 911 after sneaking into the bathroom. i gave them their license plate number and address. 

apparently they blew really high bac and child protective services are now involved. my friends are all livid with me and even my husband is pissed. no one wants anything to do with us and my husband keeps trying to explain to me that i violated friend code in the military community. i have been blocked by everyone on social media and we are furthermore uninvited to future get togethers. my husband is so mad!

i truly stand by what i did. am i really the asshole here?! everyone is so mad at me, am i just being a prude?! help please

**update:** thank you so much everyone for your votes of confident. i do feel a lot better, and thank you for the gold! i am getting a lot of nasty messages saying that i ruined a family and i should be ashamed, but i think they would be worse off if they died.

an update on my personal life- we're being interviewed by military police. the higher ranking people in my husband's chain of command are really thankful that the report was made. the lower ranking ones (my husband's peers) are pretty livid and any thanksgiving or christmas plans made with my family have been taken back. we're going to have to get used to outcast life for a while since we'll live here for at least another year. my husband has calmed down but he has barely spoken to me and has been sleeping on the couch.

i've deleted all my social media accounts for now just because i'm tired of being in the middle of this. i think i'm going to take a small vacation and stay with my parents in another state, until i can get my head on straight. 

**update 2:** to answer some of the questions people had about why i didn't try harder. 

i couldn't be around to collect their keys. i finished my shift and come home around 11pm (i work at a restaurant) and i just wanted to shower. everyone had already been partying for hours by now. the baby started to cry and the couple insisted they needed to go. i offered to get them an uber or they could have the pull out couch or even our bed. i tried to get an uber through the app but my husband told me i needed to stop nagging and leave them alone. it's not easy trying to convince a drunk person to stay if they insist on leaving.

no it didn't occur to me to slash their tires or break their car battery.

i don't know anything about calling their command. my husband is a first year in the military and graduated boot camp earlier this year.

i'm not trying to exaggerate how drunk they were, when i tried to get them to stay i could hardly make out what they were trying to say besides ""she needs her crib"" and ""our house is right there!"" 

to answer how they knew it was me, this isn't the first time i've tried to keep people from leaving a party before. there is a group text everyone is in and they asked me straight up if i made the call. i said i did. i didn't want to lie about it.",3
"final update i (27f) found out my boyfriend (33m) is not divorced or childless when i told him i was pregnant.. short update because i realize it kind of seems like i left you guys hanging. 

first i'd like to address that the pregnancy was not unexpected but not explicitly planned. ""accidental"" was not the right word, but i'm aware of how babies are made. i was in a sense trying to get pregnant, but only because my ex lied to me and convinced me he was onboard. i'm not gonna sit here and explain the ins and outs of how i was duped, i was stupid and missed some flags but i absolutely planned on bringing a child into what i expected would be a healthy, safe, loving environment. 

that environment is not real. i am not ready to be a mother under the current circumstances, i am not mentally or emotionally fit to carry out a pregnancy, and i am most definitely not going to put a child through the adoption system. it is just not a guarantee of a good life and i can't in good conscience do that. for those and other reasons i've explained before, i have begun the process of getting an abortion. 

i collected photographs, videos, screenshots of texts, and everything i could find as evidence to show my ex's wife. i tried to find texts in which he referenced being divorced or just any lies to prove that i'm not at fault, but i heeded yalls warnings to not try and help her or push her too far since i don't know how she'd receive these news. i simply found her on social media, sent her all the pictures and screenshots, and a short run down of what her husbands been doing for 2 years. it took a day for her to respond but all she said was ""thank you"" and once i saw that, i blocked her. 

i have not heard from anyone and i hope to never have to hear or think about this situation again. it's behind me. i have no idea what happened with my ex and his wife, and i probably never will. 

thank you guys for your support.",7
"for leaving my own surprise party?. i (17f) have been struggling with some depression after my dad passed. i spend about a year isolated, never leaving my room, just laying in bed all day miserable. i started going to therapy and working two days a week, but the moment i come home i will still crawl right into bed. i just have no energy. 

my 17th birthday was a few days ago and my mom was asking if i wanted a party, she thought it would be good for me. i told her several times that no, i don't want a party, pretending to be totally fine and happy is exhausting. especially with that many people around. 

but when i came back from work and opened the door, the house was filled with people. (maybe 10% family i'm not close to and 90% my moms friends). i didn't know what to do so i walked back out again, i grabbed a slice of pizza somewhere and walked around the park, hoping that when i came back they would be gone. 

while at the park my phone blew up with texts from my family and mom, that i was ungrateful and spoiled and didn't deserve nice things they tried to do. 

i came home about two hours after i left the party, my mom was super pissed. i tried to explain but she thinks it's just excuses. 


was i the asshole? my mom is still not speaking to me, and i do feel bad that she went though all that effort for nothing.



edit: my mom and dad divorced a few years back if that matters. and i do have friends that my mom knows, but none of them were invited.


edit 2: 

i'm already in therapy and its helping.

 this wasn't meant as a validation post, your parent and family telling you you're wrong will make you doubt yourself. 

and i was dead on my feet, i had just worked 9 hours and i just wanted to sleep. i'm an introvert so social interactions already cost a lot of energy, so i couldn't have just 'faked in for an hour'

pretending to be fine when you're not takes a lot of energy, and i couldn't at that point.



edit 3: after receiving several messages about ""using your dead daddy for attention seeking"" and the like, i'm going to log off for a while. thank you everyone for commenting :)",3

"best knock knock joke ever... three brothers age 92, 94 and 96 live in a house together.

one night the 96 year old draws a bath, puts his foot in and pauses. he yells down the stairs, ""was i getting in or out of the bath?""

the 94 year old yells back, ""i don't know, i'll come up and see."" he starts up the stairs and pauses, then he yells, ""was i going up the stairs or coming down?""

the 92 year old was sitting at the kitchen table having coffee listening to his brothers. he shakes his head and says, ""i sure hope i never get that forgetful."" he knocks on wood for good luck. he then yells, ""i'll come up and help both of you as soon as i see who's at the door.""",0
"restaurant owners took 24% of my tip last night.. update: i'm actually working a shift at this place right now. my plan was to talk with the owners in person after the shift, however a handful of you have suggested emailing/texting would be better since there's no guarantee they'd consent to being recorded. my plan now is to email them either after my shift tonight or some time tomorrow after i've made some necessary calls. i understand now that it may be legal after all given that it was an included service charge. some have speculated that they may be paying employer-based taxes with it, however for the past five years i've been here they haven't been going anywhere near our gratuities. hopefully they'll be honest with me when i email them and i can let you guys know what's really going on. again, thank you all for the advice. i'm trying my best to reply to all of the comments. i wasn't expecting this much attention.

———————

i live in maryland. i wait tables for $3.63 an hour plus tips. last night i was handed an invoice for a party i was working and at the very bottom, written in pen, the owner's wife/co-owner wrote ""tip x 0.78 = tip for server"". that's 22% of my gratuity. on top of that they've been taking 2% of our gratuity every night to help pay for the credit/debit card transactions. the fact that the owners are taking our tip money because they need spending money infuriates me. especially considering we already share 25% with the support service staff.

edit: thanks all for the advice. my plan now is to confront one of the owners about it and make sure to record what's said. updates to come later.

edit 2: to all those concerned, i actually started work at another job 3 months ago in anticipation of this restaurant going out of business, or me having to quit. haven't pulled the trigger yet because even with both jobs money is tight. being trained to bartend at the new place and from the looks of it, once i'm done with my training, the money from that will sustain me enough so that i can quit the restaurant in question. i appreciate the concern, you all have been incredibly helpful.",2

"update - california - douche with a train horn on his truck - i am not at fault. california 

original post here - https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bea5yk/california_involved_in_accident_caused_by_prank/

my car was towed pretty quickly after the accident, and once i gave my statement, my wife picked me up and took me to the auto shop that i asked the tow truck driver to take the car to. 

so my insurance is going to sue the guy for the cost of the repair, my adjuster is not pleased with the situation. he met me at the auto shop a couple days after the accident, and he was just shaking his head all the while saying ""this is so freaking stupid...a train horn?! really!?"" right now i am looking at $7,400 worth of damage on my 2017 s60 t6 volvo. i love this car and am so pissed that it has been in an accident! 

tiny dick truck douche actually had his car towed and impounded because he disabled the factory horn, therefore according to the police, his car was ""lacking basic safety equipment required by california law"" and was not ""road worthy."" petty i know, but oh so satisfying! 

the main responding cop called me this am to tell me all of this, and that i, along with the guy i hit (he did indeed hit car #3) will not be ticketed. they concluded that involuntary jerk of the wheel due to hearing a train horn next to our cars was what caused the accident. 

we will likely be summoned to court to testify against this guy in some kind of criminal trial. the cop went on to tell me that wrote him up for everything he possibly could. cop gave me a brief rundown, i do not remember it all, but his exhaust was illegally modified, he did not have mudflaps, his tint was too dark...sounds like they went through his car with a fine toothed comb. 

they gave him a couple other tickets pertaining to being the cause of the accident, basically loud horn disturbed the peace, creating unsafe driving conditions, etc. 

so apparently this guy is ""known"" in the area. calls have been made before about a dark colored, lifted truck making a loud horn noise, and the cops know all about him. this seems like it was their chance to finally nab him and his childish antics. 

don't know what is going to happen to my insurance rate, but at least no points on my license!

so i am sure it will be sometime before i have a final update, but that's what's going on with me.",2

"as a father of 4, i have failed. as i sit here writing this i am half tempted to stop. why? i ask myself, what is this going to solve? but for some reason typing this and facing this makes it hurt less.  i have four children ages 11, 7, and twin boys who are 3.  this year has been absolutely miserable.  after living with my girlfriends parents for years to get on our feet we did it at the beginning of this year.  

i was promised a promotion at work which would bring in much more money and we could live comfortably, however that did not happen.  my brother was murdered in a rite-aid a few months ago, i suffered a broken leg and missed work for a month, and our bills fell behind and i fell into a deep depression.  

i have been paying rent, but late every month.  often times not being paid until the 15th of the month.  i hate having to sacrifice paying either the power or water bill, or just not getting gas in the car for the week.  christmas is now here, and my kids are asking me why we don't have a christmas tree? how am i supposed to tell them that we can't afford one?

i have sold all of my stuff worth of any value to be able to pay some bills and i have nothing left.  my power is due to be cut off on december 10 because of a $400.00 past due balance, my water is due to be cut off december 10th as well due to $120.00 past due.  and of course all this comes full circle in december.  

i just got off the phone with my landlord asking in a not so happy tone when the rest of decembers rent would be paid.  i feel like a complete and utter failure.  it pains me to my core, and nothing hurts more than seeing my kids go without.  i honestly don't think i can bare to look into their eyes on christmas morning, and what i will say.  

or what i will say on monday when we have no power or water.  i am working two minimum wage jobs, and their mother is working full time as well, yet we are barely scraping by and can't get caught up because of the month with no income.  if there was only a way to get caught up we would be ok.  but playing catch up with past due balances in coming full circle.

i just wanted to vent, and perhaps cry a little, for the pain i feel for my kids.  i hate myself that i could of not done better, or i could have a better job with more income.  i am supposed to be a father and a provider and i can't even do that.  i am dreading christmas morning, and wish i can just escape all of this.  

**update: power bill almost completely paid up, and water bill paid in full. (http://i.imgur.com/piaxz.jpg) you are all amazing great people!!!**

**update 2: thank you all!!!! the compassion is beyond amazing. just a fyi almost all extra gifts, and some of the high priced items on the wish list will be going to my brothers family, my brother was murdered a couple months ago, as well as some of the money. i will also be paying all this extra generosity to others who need it around me as well. pictures will be posted for proof. your all amazing and many tears have been shed today**

**update 3: honestly everyone, this is beyond amazing. please please help others who are on here needing assistance with bills and toys.  again - all extra money and toys will be going to others so i can spread your love.  please please help others out here who need it now, let's make this a night amazing for others as well. thank  you for everything.**

**update 4: i see i am  getting a lot of hate now, but i am blown away by all of this. so please if you were one of the people posting on here about how you need help please pm your info and let me help you now.  i have lots of extra toys and money to help pay some bills. for the final time all this extra compassion will be put to use to make this holiday just as good for somebody else, so please let me help now the best i can, please please donate to others now!! we are beyond blessed at this point.  let's make this an awesome one for others too!!**

**update 5: final update: thank you all again. i honestly can't say that enough i hope i helped some other people out as well. i need to get home and go to bed as i got work at 5am.  please no more donations you have all done so much already.  i am eternally grateful to all of you.  pictures will be posted of christmas and the gifts i have helped others with.  goodnight and thank you.**

**one last update: i am trying my best to go through all of the submissions for help.  as of this morning over $1,800 dollars has gone to helping others with power bills, toys, car repairs, food money, and etc. donations are also being made to a local community outreach center that helps with utilities and other hardships.  to answer just a few questions. people are skimming my pasts posts regarding me purchasing turn tables, records, and etc.  99% percent of those items were purchased at thrift stores and yard sales for pennies on the dollar.  that money came from many of the side jobs i do for extra cash, and everything that was posted was sold well over 6-8 weeks ago.

the reason i kept adding to the wish list was for the benefit of others that i know from my place of employment, in the neighborhood, and others who are need that can benefit from the kindness of others. the higher priced items that were added was in part from my daughter sitting in during my phone calls as i told her ""add some stuff your brothers and other kids would like"", she is a kid she didn't know any better.  

i am at work on break but i am trying to fill as many christmas wishes with verification as possible, if i don't respond or can't help out i am sorry, i am trying everything i can.  the indiegogo is in the process of being hidden.  once opened they will not close it once donations have been made, but they can ""hide"" it so no more donations will be made.  i sent the request by e-mail last night and i am hoping it will be taken down. for those sending negative hate, threatening e-mails and messages, and even death threats, please put that negative energy into helping others.  for everybody that donated and contributed, and sending positive message and vibes i thank you from the bottom of my heart.  you are all wonderful people.  pictures will be post once the holiday nears of others receiving goods, and etc.  thank you and happy holidays to all of you**",11

"inspired by the coconut, shoebox, and couch fucker stories, i have now decided to share my own disgusting past story. please feel free to judge, i am very disgusted by my actions.. i suppose i could post this in tifu, but i never got caught for what i did, that i know of...

to begin, i guess i'll just start out by saying this started around age 12 and continued off and on throughout some of my highschool years. when i was 12, i began watching porn and became addicted to it and masturbation pretty quickly. i was pretty good at getting away with it (i assume) and never had any issues getting caught as i was super paranoid about making sure i covered my tracks.

over time, i realized that the same porn videos and masturbation methods that i was using were not getting me off the way that they used to. i began to search for alternative ways to get off, as i'm sure every male has at some point. i started to create my own sex contraptions (obviously when my parents weren't home)... the best one i made comprised of a latex glove in between a towel that i would roll with the glove inside. i would stretch the glove around the edges and hold it all together with a rubber band and i would use whatever lube i could get my hands on. i was so proud of myself for actually completing this ""project"", and it kept me satisfied for a while (i would change the glove out, i wasn't totally like the coconut dude at this point). after several uses, again i began to get tired of this, but it was all i had at the time.

one day, i was in my parents closet, and i found a box of ""the stash."" any of you out there who have been traumatized by finding your parents secret stash of sex toys will understand what i'm talking about. here's where my problem goes more south. as grossed out as i was by the box of sex toys used by my parents, i was fascinated. i waited for the next time my parents were gone and i explored the box (i'm disgusted writing this, please forgive me). the item that caught my attention most, was my dad's fleshlight.

for those of you who are still reading, you're brave. it only gets worse from here. from this point on in my life, if i ever had that ""urge"" to masturbate, i would wait until i had the house to myself and i would go to town on that fleshlight. i would even use small amounts of my parents lube that i had found, and man it was the best experience that a hormone-filled teenage boy could have asked for aside from actual sex. i would always clean it thoroughly after use, as i would have wanted to die if anyone ever found out what i was doing. one day, when i went to use it, i ""prepared"" myself and got everything ready, and when i ""entered"", i was struck by absolute terror...

it hadn't been cleaned from previous use (not by me!)

i immediately was sent into regret and did not want to continue... as the remnants of the most recent use still remained.. but the disgusting nature of my teen self prevailed, and i still continued and finished, not wanting to waste a rare occasion where i was alone in the house.

overall, at some point in high school, i guess it just kinda clicked how completely disgusting it was for me to continue doing it, so i stopped. i only wish i could delete the memories and guilt that still remains. as far as i'm concerned, nobody knows about this and the box is still there.

tl:dr- became addicted to porn and masturbation at an early age, found my parents sex toy stash, used my dad's fleshlight without him knowing for years. even once when he hadn't cleaned it after previous use.

edit: this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. even writing this out in words makes me feel so embarrassed and ashamed.

edit 2: further explanation and tldr

edit 3: i cleaned the fleshlight after the use even though it wasn't clean for me initially...

edit 4: at least i can say that i didn't have sex with my mother.",12
"by looking to make my job easier and getting 3/4 of my department laid-off instead. this just happened last week and i am still very upset. i work for a medium sized drilling company with about 200 employees. i am in accounts payable \(ap\). my job is laymen terms was to take all the invoices, organize them, archive them, and then pay them. usually we would process about 1000/month and they would range from 1 page to 50 sometimes. the scanning was the worst part though. we would print every single invoice, then scan it, then archive it. with our copier, i had to scan each invoice separately, then rename it on the shared folder to the date and then put it in the corresponding company folder. we had 4 people doing this.

a new hire came on about 3 months prior and told us about at her old company, they would just put a separator sheet with a barcode between each invoice and be able to scan a stack of invoices and it will auto separate the invoices into separate files which we can then go and manually rename and organize into the right folder. that sounded amazing to me. that would save a lot of time and reduce the most tedious part of my job.

here is the fuck up. i tell my boss about this technology and they call the copier company to inquire about it. a meeting is set up with myself, my boss, our it manager and their sales rep and software specialist. they ask a lot of questions about the process we currently have and what we want. i answer all of it and explain exactly what we need. they tried to pitch the idea of a more integrated system, but we told them that's not what we are looking for and they seemed to accept it. i come out of the meeting excited because they tell me they can do exactly that.

about 2 months go by and i haven't heard from any higher\-ups what is going on with the new software until one day i get called into my bosses office. i come to find out that the software company took the information i gave them and went to our cfo about integrating a new system to essentially automate 90&#37; of the ap process. i am also told that i'm being laid off due to this and i find out later they laid off 2 of my coworkers as well. so essentially this company that was suppose to help me ended up seeing a much bigger opportunity to sell a much more expensive software that screwed me but saves them 150k a year in salaries. fuck.

**tldr: i had my bosses reach out to a software company to look into simplifying one part of my job, but they used the information to sell another software that put me and 2 others out of a job.**


edit: wow! didn't expect this to get so popular. yes i should have kept my mouth shut, but at the same time the system we had in place was very inefficient and was bound to change. like i would start my morning taking the batch of signed documents from the day prior, grabbing the largest ones and scanning them while grabbing coffee or browsing reddit. it was a joke and also very very verrrrry boring. i'm mostly pissed at the it manager who i thought was a friend but i didn't even realize the project he was working on the last month was to have me out of a job.

also i don't hate my boss. his hands were tied by upper management. he also offered to get each of us an interview at our parent company and i have an interview next week. it might even pay more! this experience has definitely made me a little more aware of how easily replaceable you can be, and i think im going to take the advice of other commenters and be a bit more diligent about being irreplaceable in my next job.",4
"update: just found out my husband (28m) invited another woman over to spend the night while i'm (24f) away on business. how to proceed?. 
update 2(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2xkpx/update_2_just_found_out_my_husband_28m_invited/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) 

first off, i just want to thank everyone for being patient while i sort this shit out. as i mentioned in my previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c0hmre/just_found_out_my_husband_invited_another_woman/), i left on a business trip, and had actual work to do. i also managed to get my account banned from r/relationship_advice because i suck at reddit, but thanks to the helpful mods here who helped me get verified. i made the original post on very little sleep and in a very bad headspace, and honestly never thought my post would get as much attention as it did. while i read through as many of the comments as i could, i needed a few days to sort through my own thoughts, because this situation may be entertainment to you, but it's my real life, and has real, lasting consequences that i'll have to live with.

there is a lot of backstory that's necessary to truly understand the state of our union, so rather than post multiple updates, i've broken it up into sections. feel free to skip over what you're not interested in, and skim what you are. tldr; at the bottom of each section and at the bottom of the post.

# confrontation:

thank you to those who responded in the early hours. it was 1:30am when i posted, and i'd gotten a whopping three hours of sleep. needless to say, i was not in the best headspace. someone gave the advice to tell him ""i'm hurt and disappointed, i'm leaving, you need to fix this."" someone else said to tell him that it doesn't matter how i found out, what matters is that it happened. thank you for that, too. both those comments really stuck with me, and i lay in bed waiting for him to wake up, typing out how i would respond to whatever direction our conversation took.

\*\*quick side note: we've been together for 4 years, and other women have been a constant problem in our relationship. he, and many people close to him and me, all say he's not the guy to cheat. he's flirty, but he'd never cheat. he's a long-term relationship guy, and loyal to the core. that being said, he's had a history of withholding information from me because he thinks it'll make me mad, and he doesn't want me to be upset with him. i'm a pretty chill person, and honestly wouldn't have cared if he'd asked this girl over and told me about it. in the past, i haven't handled him lying to me very well, hence wanting to have a plan.

while i was waiting for him to wake up, i did something i'm not very proud of. where i know he'd lied to me, and i wanted to have proof of the things he told me about her moving forward, especially where i'd be gone, and she was supposed to be spending the night, i set up his imessages to come to my ipad. i know all his passwords, so i deleted the email alerts, and just added his phone number. i'm not proud of it, but i didn't have cameras at home, and needed to know whether he was telling me the truth while i was gone.

he woke up, and i decided to give him one last chance. as i was gathering my things, i asked him what he had planned while i was gone. he gave a very detailed report of his daily plans, casually leaving out anything about this girl staying the night or going to colorado with him. i was so livid, because just the night before, we'd gotten into a pretty big fight where he said, ""and you don't trust me! i've done nothing, ***nothing*** to deserve it, but you still treat me like i'm sneaking around."" that hurt, because we've been going to therapy, and i thought i'd been doing really well at giving him the benefit of the doubt. i used to check his phone (b/c of the earlier problems we'd had) but haven't done that in months. it made me feel crazy and ashamed at the time, and now here i was, standing in our bedroom, watching my husband lie to me through his teeth.

i said, ""i know you're lying to me. i know you're not going to colorado alone, and i know you invited a fucking 18 year old to spend the night in my bed."" and then i just waited, the silence heavy. he took a deep breath, and said he had two questions. 1) how did i know? (it doesn't matter. i know.) 2) did i know during our conversation last night?

\*\*quick side note: we've been having a lot of problems lately. we both have mental illnesses which are sometimes exacerbated by the other's (he has adhd, depression, and ptsd - and i'm starting to wonder maybe bipolar of some sort, and i have ptsd, anxiety, and a number of health issues), and he's not very good at controlling his anger. nothing more physical than throwing things or punching walls, but it is absolutely verbal and emotional abuse. i wasn't sure if it was before, but after a recent fight we had in which i asked him to stop screaming at me so i could finish packing, he said, ""you can multitask."" yeah, i realize he sounds like a shit person. and when he's in that headspace, he is. it's very much a dr. jekyll/mr. hyde situation, and when he's kind and calm, he's the sweetest, most loving person i've met, and that's who i fell in love with. i care for him, even at the same time as i know that i don't deserve him. so the night before, we had a very heartfelt, emotional talk, in which i told him i wanted him to be happy. i could tell that he wasn't, and i thought he should go home (several thousand miles away) for a few months to figure himself out. i told him i would be his biggest cheerleader, and that if we ended up staying together or divorcing, i would always love him, and he would always be my family. we've been through some shit, both together and separately, and we were both sobbing by the end of it. but here's the kicker: i told him that if he needed another woman to make him happy, i would let him go, and support him as a friend. end of side note \*\*

as a result, i was probably pretty harsh in my response, and said, ""no, i didn't know during our conversation last night. and now i feel like an idiot, like my husband has been fucking a teenager and i just gave him my blessing."" he tried to get defensive and said that ""it's not like that."" i got really quiet, and said, ""you're a very smart man. but if you can't see that girl wants to get in your pants, you're a fucking idiot. she texts you about her taking bubble baths, and you fucking tell her about all our problems. her. when you won't even talk about me with most of your friends, you're telling an 18 year old about all of our problems."" he said he would cancel his plans with her, and i said, ""i'm not making that decision, you are. i honestly don't know how you can fix this. i don't. i don't care if you go with her at this point. but i'm leaving, and i'm hurt and disappointed, and you need to figure out where your priorities are, because right now? your priority isn't your wife, it's your 18 year old crush."" he kept saying he should've told me, but that he didn't want me to make him feel guilty for wanting to hang out with his friend, and that i should've known that nothing would happen. i asked him if he loved her, and his gut response was ""no, of course not, that's not at all what i'm looking for"" and said that most of the time, he doesn't even like talking to her every day because she's so immature. i told him he was an idiot if he thought she didn't have feelings for him. he tried to push back, but i told him ""i was 18 once, and i liked someone who was 28. we went on a date, but when he found out i was 18, he told me he couldn't see me anymore. i said it was fine, and that we could just be friends, but i still tried my hardest to get him to fall for me."" he was silent after that for a long time. 

that was it. he drove me to the airport. he cried a lot, and apologized a lot. i felt a lot of nothing. heartbreak, maybe? but there's been so much turmoil in our relationship that i just didn't care anymore.

***confrontation tldr;*** **i told him i was hurt and angry and leaving, and he needed to figure out how to fix it. he told me that there was no sexual motivation to them hanging out, and that her spending the night was just so they could get an early start in the morning. he showed me texts where he said he would sleep on the couch and she could sleep in the bed (which is somehow worse to me, my bed is my space). he was very apologetic, and knew he messed up. he dropped me off at the airport, and things were still very uncertain.**

\*\*

# the fallout

we left things the way we'd planned to leave them during the heartfelt conversation the night before. we both planned to take the 5 days i was gone to do some soul-searching and figure out what and where we needed to be happy. then, when i got home, we'd talk it over, and make a plan.

well, when my plane landed at my destination, and i got a text from my husband saying that he would be moved out of our house by the time i got back, and that he's going home to the east coast. he said he was sorry to leave me to manage our upcoming move on my own, and that he knew i would be better off this way. he said he was taking the car so he could drive back, but that he'd leave me all of the money in our bank accounts, except what he needed for gas. he said he was sorry for keeping the information about his friend from me, but that our conversation last night had meant so much to him and had been such a high point of our relationship, that to wake up and be accused of cheating was a low point that he could not turn back from. he said he didn't know how to make me believe that his intentions were nothing other than company on the drive with his friend, but that it didn't matter and he would leave me alone.

i've never felt that angry, hurt, or desperate before. i was coordinating the travel of more than a dozen other people, who were on the flight with me, and it felt like all the wind had been knocked out of me. i wanted to sob and scream, but i couldn't, because i was surrounded by people i was supposed to be responsible for. i tried my hardest to gain composure, but a few tears slipped out, and i just focused on my breathing. if i'm being honest, i'm not proud of my response. i basically begged him to stay. i'd left feeling like if he needed to leave and we didn't stay together, it would be okay, but knowing that i'd be returning home to an empty house, not getting to say goodbye, and that he was ending things over ***text*** after four years together, was just too much for me. i sounded like a child, i said i needed him, that he was making a stupid mistake, that i deserved more than ending our ***marriage*** over text, all the cliches. it was bad. but he was determined to leave, and i had to get over a dozen people to our final destination, so i couldn't keep messaging him.

about an hour later, i got a text that he would at least be staying until i got back, because of our dogs. nobody could watch them, so he'd stay until i was home, and then he'd go. we planned on having a phone call that night to talk over the specifics, but it never happened. i was too busy and physically/emotionally exhausted.

i know (from his texts coming to my ipad, but also from him telling me) that he canceled with the girl. i know that he also invited her over (which was partly my doing, w/ the texts i was getting i didn't want him to be alone, regardless of if he fucked her - then there would be no question) i know that he called his best friend and talked to him about everything for an hour and a half (which was very good, he is a phenomenal human being, and has a great marriage/advice). husband seemed more calm and level-headed after that call. he said he would take the rest of the week to think things through, like we planned.

we didn't talk much, he texted me every day, and i sometimes responded. the week went by quickly, and i realized i didn't want to go home. i'm not sure if that's because of all the drama and chaos that was waiting there, or if its because i no longer want to be married to my husband. i don't know a lot of things anymore, and i'm trying to take each day one at a time. i had a small panic attack as he was about to pick me up. i've had worse, but i sat outside at passenger pickup, trying to breathe oxygen that wasn't there, and wipe tears from my eyes. maybe it was the anticipation of not knowing what would happen or where we'd stand, i don't know. but when he hugged me, he got all emotional that i was home, and i just… felt so far away. you know how when you hug someone intimately, it feels like your souls are hugging? it felt nothing like that, which was new. it felt like hugging a stranger.

so yeah, now i'm home. my flight was delayed, so we both just crashed into bed as soon as we got back. i was asleep when he left for work, so we haven't talked about anything, but i'm expecting we will tonight, and i'll post an update then.

i know you may be looking for more resolution, and i wish i had it. i don't even know what i want to do yet. part of me is ready to leave, to be done, to move on with my life. i'd want to take a good chunk of time and work on myself, but then i'd want to find someone who is transparent with me, and who understands and accepts the many parts of me that may be inconvenient, but are still me.

part of me wants to give him one more chance. one more opportunity to get his anger under control, communicate well, and make things work. to you, reading this, it may seem black and white. but to me, living it, it's anything but. i've spent nearly every day with this man for 4 years. we've lived together for two and a half. we have two dogs, a house, a life. it's hard to just throw that all away, even if it's what ends up being best for both of us. but that's not a decision i'm willing to make lightly or on a whim. since i left, he's been much better about following a routine, and he hasn't texted the girl at all. he did say that she im'd him at work, and that they talked there for a bit. i appreciated the honesty, but not knowing what they talked about has me nervous. if we do stay together, there's a lot of work that will need to be done. i told him he can kiss me on the cheek, but for right now, i can't be vulnerable or open with him, or trust him at all (because of the anger stuff and things he said to me during that fight). it'll take a lot of time and patience, and i don't know if he's willing to give it.

\*\*if you want me to read and consider your comment, please don't throw him under the bus. he is absolutely in the wrong in this situation, but he's also been through a lot and i understand his behavior, even if i don't excuse it. he is ***not*** a piece of shit, even if he may be ***acting*** like one.

***fallout tldr;*** **husband tried to end our marriage over text because me confronting him about his plans with the girl was too much for him to handle. he had a bit of a mental breakdown, and i told him to call her - or anyone - so he wouldn't be alone. he did, and she stayed for an hour and a half before he asked her to go home so he could call his best friend. he picked me up at the airport, but since my flight was delayed, we haven't talked or made plans yet.**

***post tldr;*** **confronted husband before i left. he didn't deny the plans, but denied that there was anything sexual motivating them. he canceled the plans with the girl, but then tried to end our marriage through text. there's a lot of backstory, our marriage has been pretty rocky lately, and he's got some anger issues he needs to work through. he got some help from his best friend (who lives in his hometown on the east coast), and seemed much more stable. we haven't talked much while i've been gone, and i don't know where things stand yet. he did say he doesn't even like talking to her some days, because she's so immature. not sure if i believe him, but he seemed sincere. we're going to talk through everything when he gets home from work tonight, and i'll update then.**

edit: forgot to add that while i was gone, i saw messages from them on my ipad in which she admitted that ""yesterday when you asked me about your hair i got nervous because i'd rather avoid the confrontation of this conversation. but i just have thought about certain things that completely cross the line of being friends and i didn't want to put myself in a situation that i might not get out of, if that makes sense. idk if that does. i just didn't want to get myself in a tempting situation so i needed to put up a wall. i'm going to go do some climbing."" he responded ""that makes complete sense. i really understand. i knew i shouldn't ask, that had always just been a very comforting action for me, and i was giving into my sadness. but i admire you for doing what was best for you. i really hope you have a fun time today."" when i got back and asked what he did while i was gone, i said ""i really appreciate how you've been so open about things with her, even when they've been uncomfortable. it makes me feel like maybe i can start to trust you again."" and then he told me all of that on his own. basically, he loves getting his head scratched when he's stressed or upset, and asked her to do that, and this conversation ensued. he didn't know that i knew about it, so it was nice that he showed some fucking transparency for once.

*update:* okay, i've heard everyone loud and clear. i just spent 6 hours in bed reading responses and bawling my eyes out. you're right. every single one of you. he doesn't want a strong, independent woman, and that's what i need to be. i just got off the phone with my mom (who is an incredibly religious person, and i assumed would be unsupportive of a divorce) but she said almost verbatim, some of the same things you guys said. we made an exit plan, both for worst case and best case scenario, and i'll be talking to him tonight when he gets home. in the meantime, i'm going to go get coffee with my friend and try to calm down a bit. i've been putting myself second for so long that i deserve a bit of self-care.

i also think its comparable to alcoholism if you're using super regularly. you're inhibiting yourself and changing the way your mind works.

"should i 29f divorce my 49m husband?. i am in a horrible situation and need some sound advice. a little background, i've been married for four years, together for five, no kids. when we met i was in the midst of a sever heroin addiction and he was my ""savior"". my mother was trying to get me to go back to rehab but he let me move in with him instead. thank god i've been clean 3 years, but my life is miserable.
he asked me to marry him after a month of dating. a year later he basically said ""we are going to go to the courthouse and get married this weekend"". i told him i wasn't comfortable, because i'd only been clean a month at the time. he told me if i didn't marry him he'd leave me because our relationship is pointless. i married him because at the time i was a totally weak person and thought i couldn't live without him. i'm ashamed of it but that's the truth.
throughout the next year i relapsed a few times, and drug him through hell. i got clean and thought the worst was behind us.
he began drinking every night. for the past two years he berates me every single night. it starts with him saying ""i hate our relationship"" and ends in him calling me fat, ugly, and telling me i'm the worst sex hes ever had. he has stalked me at work, waiting for me in the parking lot. i had to quit my last job because of him. he called my crazy boss and told him i was having sex with his son, which i wasn't. he was just jealous because his son was young, closer to my age, and we were friends. another job i lost because he got mad at me one night and left all of my clothes outside the front doors of my work on the busiest night of the week. he has physically assaulted me and i've told a few close friends that if i ever end up dead, it was him. he scares me. 
but the thought i keep going back to is, maybe i deserve it because of all i put him through when i relapsed. when i used i went to the deepest darkest places of hell and he went through a lot. he claims he's traumatized from all i've done to him. but i'm sick of my life with him, sick of him, and just want to get the f out. what should i do?",7

her mother is notorious for stealing her children's identities, opening credit cards, putting bills in their names. stuff like that. so it occurred to me that i dont have his social security number card. i asked his mother if she took it to florida with her and she told me her mother stole it from her. 
obviously this is a concern to me. i thought maybe i could check his credit on credit karma or something to see if shes used it yet but he isn't old enough for me to check that way. 

is there a way for me to check if shes using his ssn? if not is there some way i can preemptively report her for stealing his identity even if i'm not sure that shes used it yet?

"by having a really high pain tolerance.. so bonus points because this actually happened today but the story starts about a week and a half ago. 

day one: i am lactose intolerant, and i had a stomach ache, no big deal i probably ate something i shouldn't have. no harm done.

day 4: stomach ache is still there. i'm a medical professional, i realized that my abdomen on my right lower side was what hurt. wrote it off as having too much ice cream.

day 6: i thought to myself it could be appendicitis, but i shrugged it off because appendicitis is supposed to be super painful right? this was like 4/10. 

day 7:  i realized i had a lump near my anus, i thought huh that's not good, probably just a hemorrhoid, i've had a few before no biggie.

day 9: this hemorrhoid is the most  painful one i've ever had, 6/10 i'll pick up some cream and advil long lasting relief capsules from target should be able to push right through.


day 11:  i start my vacation tomorrow and am going out of town, (i work in a hospital for context) well that hemorrhoid is really starting to hurt at this point, like a 7/10. so i go work thinking okay i can get a doctor to look at the hemorrhoid and give me some ointment or steroids. 

well i'm not having a vacation now, because i'll be in the hospital for a few days. apparently my appendix ruptured a week ago and i just figured it was a stomach ache. turns out that hemorrhoid was actually pain from the appendix ruptured radiating. the doctor told me that if i didn't come to the hospital within the next couple of days i'd be dead. 

tldr; having a high pain tolerance finally has a downside, didn't realize my appendix blew up until way too late. ruined my vacation.

sorry for format i'm on mobile, i'm also on dilaudid and morphine (one then the other) so please go easy on me. credit to my girlfriend who begged me to go to the hospital before vacation, i was going to hold off till after a 2 week vacation that i would have died on.


update: so i had a few people question why i felt pain by my anus and how was a lumped formed? so i talked to a surgeon who finally spend the time explaining it, when my appendix ruptured it caused everything else to inflame. the lump i was feeling was pus caused by the colon and gravity causes it to go down.

"update: for refusing to apologise to my sister?. original(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/beaaz7/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_to_my_sister/)

so my sister's wedding was today. i took the advice of people here and apologised to keep the peace/make things easier for my mum, but told her that my partner and i are kind of a package deal and that either both of us come or neither of us do. she stuck to her guns and said that my partner wasn't welcome, at first maintaining that it was because of his tattoos and then eventually getting emotional and yelling at me that he wasn't allowed after ""what he'd done to her"", which confirms my theory that it was because he rejected her years ago. i just calmly kept telling her that if she didn't want him to come then fine, but not to expect me either. 

i guess she thought i wasn't being serious, because i got a call from my mum shortly before the ceremony was due to start asking where i was. i told her i wasn't coming. i got a *lot* of rather abusive texts from my stepfather, telling me he always knew i was worthless but this was a new level, as well as some direct threats. i ignored them all, though i did text mum and apologise for causing problems but i *did* inform my sister i wouldn't be going. culminated about an hour ago with my stepfather and now brother in law showing up drunk at my flat and trying to fight me while my sister cried outside. they got removed by building security, and honestly it was more funny than anything to me. apparently i've ruined her wedding day, but i'm really struggling to care. maybe that makes me now the asshole, i can accept that. 

just thought i would share this update, since i posted about it here initially.

eta: clarifying a couple of things that people seem confused on.

first the whole ""she got rejected by my boyfriend"" thing. this one is my fault, i thought i'd included the story in my original post but looking back it was actually in the comments, so apologies for any confusion there! essentially what happened is that about 6 years ago, when he was 17 and she was 26, she propositioned him for sex (~~don't blame her he's hot as fuck~~ that was a poorly worded joke that fell flat, striking it out since some of y'all got triggered) and was told no. she's held a grudge ever since - i think, in part, because she was told no for pretty much the first time in her life and also later because he chose to get with me when he'd said he wasn't interested i her. he was fully out at the time she propositioned him and she was definitely aware he was gay. 

second, some people are seemingly confused and thinking this whole thing was a one off incident that led to me not going to the wedding/wanting to lessen/cut contact with her. this is not the case and is again probably due to a lack of communication on my part so again, apologies. i'll clear up that we've *never* has a good relationship, and she's been pretty cruel to the point it could be considered emotionally abusive to me since i was very small. she's also been physically abusive at several points throughout my life. this is not a debate of me placing my relationship over my family but, rather, one of me finally taking up for myself after years of being a pushover and the aftermath it's caused.",3

"my 20 fiance's 27m behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship. so i've been with my fiance for 3 nearly 4 years and i've always known that he enjoys casually playing video games. i'm not really a 'gamer' myself but i haven't had a problem with it until now. a few months ago he started playing an online video game that's a battle royale type game where you have teams and compete against other players. at first he would just play it in the evening after work like any other game for an hour or two and then we'd watch tv or a movie while i did schoolwork. however, he then began to play it from the time he got home from work at around 4pm until 2 or 3 in the morning. i wasn't a huge fan of this because it's a very loud game and he would yell into the headset to communicate with other players which was very distracting as i was doing schoolwork and we live in a small flat so sleeping was difficult. he has started started acting very differently while playing this particular game, for example he screams and swears at other players on his team if they mess up in the game or if they lose. he will also argue with other players over the messaging system and say really vulgar stuff. i mentioned being upset once b/c he was saying stuff about rape, using the n-word, etc and he told me to calm down as he was ""just joking"" and that's what everyone does.

&#x200b;

three-ish weeks ago i came home during a break between classes and he was home during a workday. he told me his job cut back his hours to only three days a week. since then he has devoted all of his spare time to gaming. i am in nursing school and also work so i'm gone most of the day, we have one day a week that neither of us work or go to school. we used to go places or run errands on those days but now if i can even get him out of the house he gets antsy and has to rush home to play so he doesn't ""miss anything"". he also expects me to continue doing a majority of the housework (which i have always done) like cleaning, laundry, and preparing meals. i told him i can't realistically go to school, work, and clean and cook. he will call me repeatedly at work or in class begging me to stop off on the way home and get him chips or beer. i'm pretty sure he lives off of crap junkfood because none of the healthy meals i prep seem to get eaten by him. junkfood is expensive and since he's barely working i am trying to shop cheaply so we can pay our rent and other expenses.

&#x200b;

the final straw for me is the way he reacts when he loses in the game--he has started throwing stuff, screaming, swearing, and lashing out at me. he has broken a lamp, knocked a leg off the coffee table, and broken multiple glasses. he broke his headset and used my amazon account to order a new one. i have tried to talk to him about this and asked him to either find another way to cope or play in an area of the home with less breakable stuff in it and he told me that i don't understand how it feels to lose an important game. he accused me of being controlling and abusive towards him which was very hurtful. he also is in a group chat with the people on his team and i once saw him (i looked over his shoulder while he was chatting, which was shitty i know this) text in their group instagram chat that i was a ""nag"" and ""always bitching at him"". even worse, a lot of the players on his team seem to be teenage boys or girls so i doubt they understand what it's like to be a in a longterm relationship. i have tried multiple times to tell him that the video game obsession is too much for me to handle, and yesterday suggested couples counseling. he has pretty much ignored me every time or promised that he'll be less aggressive on the game/limit his time. i almost dread going back to our flat bc i know he'll be gaming all night. i am aware this sounds like a very stupid problem to have, but i feel a bit like i'm living with a teenage boy.",7

i have a 16 year old son with severe physical disabilities. he uses a motorized wheelchair and requires help to get in and out of it.

my husband and i are in a friends group of families with similarly disabled children.

my son recently announced that he is dating a 17 year old girl from the group. my only problem is that this girl has severe mental and physical disabilities. she has the mental capacity of a young child, is mostly nonverbal and has tics that will cause her to hit other people in the vicinity.

my son has zero mental disabilities. i was very uncomfortable with this relationship because of the huge difference in mental capabilities. my husband felt the same but not as strongly. 

however, literally everyone in the group has been thrilled about this ""romance"". especially the girl's parents. they are talking about the two getting married for heaven's sake.

i thought that i'd just wait it out and have our son realize on his own that he cannot have a meaningful relationship with this girl.

but it's been 5 months and it's only getting worse.

i ended up putting my foot down and informed both my son and the girls parents that this relationship was completely inappropriate. especially since my son has now started being hit by the girl during her tics and he is physically unable to defend himself. my husband supported me in this.

we have become enemy number one ever since. the parents have attacked us through texts and have turned everyone in the friends group against us.

but the thing that has hurt us most is our son's reaction. he has accused us of ruining his one shot at love. 

we've been to family therapy but my son has decided to ignore us completely not give us the silent treatment. my husband and i have decided not to cave.

are we the assholes?",3
"i told my ex-boyfriend that i aborted our baby but i actually kept the baby and had her adopted.. i (21) was with my ex-boyfriend (28) for 3 and a half years, i broke up with him last may. 

he was very abusive during the whole of the relationship and i ended up in hospital a few times, once with a broken arm and a disclocated jawbone and another time after he had strangled me to the point he called an ambulance because he thought he had killed me. i decided not to press charges as he had warned me what his friends and family would do to me if he got put in prison. 

i found out i was pregnant in april last year and the abuse got worse when i told him, he threatened to kill me several times and beat me up three times because i refused to have a termination. i managed to leave him when he was at work one day with the help of two of my friends and my cousin, and moved in with one of my other cousins who lives a 3 hour drive away from him, i am still living there now. 

my ex-boyfriend contacted all my family members when he got home and realised that i had left and all my belongings were gone and made a new facebook account to message me after i blocked him on my actual account. i told him that i had booked myself in for an abortion the following monday and to please never message me again. i messaged him on the monday to let him know that i had gone through with the termination and blocked him off that account also. he hasn't contacted me since. 

i actually kept the baby and gave birth at the end of last year, i had her adopted to a childless couple as i had no home of my own, no savings and no job as i had moved across the country to get away from my ex boyfriend. i think about her every day and wish that i was in a position to have brought her up myself. 

i know this makes me a horrible person for not telling him but i'm glad i've finally got it off my chest. i hope he never finds out, my family and close friends know and i don't think they would ever say anything but i am worried about when my daughter is older and whether she will ever want to find me or her father and that it will all come out.",12

"my (25m) girlfriend (24f) of 2 years doesn't want to get rid of a bedbug infestation.. we just signed a lease last month to start living together in a new place. well, we had a housewarming party that got a bit bigger than we expected, with some friends of friends we didn't know showing up. more than 20 people in total. we suspect the bedbugs came from someone at the party. we've had them for more than a week now.

my girlfriend refuses to cooperate in getting rid of them. because she doesn't believe it's okay to do so. i'd always known she was a very compassionate person and truly views all living things as precious and important, volunteers for a few humanitarian causes like animal shelters and loves nature. but i didn't know it went this far, that eradicating pests like this is wrong. this is very extreme to me.

meanwhile, we are getting eaten alive every night and they just keep multiplying. i'm out of patience, i've asked her many times how she can stand living with this, she just says it's ""annoying"" but she couldn't bring herself to intentionally kill anything. even a fucking bedbug.

today i decided i was done with this bullshit. i called an exterminator and scheduled an appointment for tomorrow. when i told her, she flipped. i said i didn't care what she thought, she could help me pack up everything to prepare or not but it was happening. then once i went to work, she cancelled it behind my back! she texted me to tell me. she said she doesn't want to fight with me, that we should be able to ""live in harmony with each other and other creatures""!!! she also said she's really stressed due to our disagreement about it, but i'm stressed from having the bedbugs!

now i'm about to go home to our infested apartment and confront her. please help. i feel like my life has turned into some realm of insanity. how do i make her understand that the pest control needs to happen??

tl;dr: my girlfriend sabotaged my efforts to exterminate bedbugs in our home because she strictly believes it's wrong to kill them. i don't know how to make her stop or compromise.

edit: we're fucked. she got home today and said she got fired. she works at a daycare and they found bedbugs there today, then she straight up admitted they were from her. because she was trying to convince the other staff that there's ""natural"" ways to get them to leave! what ways? i've asked a million times and everything she says is bullshit. some of it i sourced to quackery sites riddled with fake health information and conspiracy theories, some she claims ""someone told her"", the rest i honestly think she just made up. anyway they let her go after she tried to argue with them. i am just blown away by her idiocy about all of this. there's no other term for it. so now i've lost a lot of respect and trust for her. it sucks. i always admired how humanitarian she was but jesus this has taught me that everything needs to have limits. and that even good impulses can be crazy and harmful in effect.

that's not the only thing. i went and talked to the other tenants last night after reading some of these comments. welp they've all been finding bedbugs too. the entire house is infested. as if my girlfriend losing her job isn't enough, i just got off the phone with the landlord. she got the complaints from the other tenants and knows we're the source of the infestation because we were the first to report it. i'd informed her i was having it taken care of after i scheduled the appointment my girlfriend ended up cancelling. so now, i had to tell her why it never happened. she was really pissed off and said she would have covered that single-time extermination assuming we were going to cooperate but now that my girlfriend fucked it up and the whole house is crawling with them, it'll be probably thousands in expenses. she told me she's going to be looking into holding us liable for the cost. i'm so absolutely fucked. i don't have thousands of dollars lying around. neither does my girlfriend who's fault it is, and as of today nor does she even have a fucking job. i am so mad i don't even know how to deal with her. she's out right now and idk when she'll be back, she's avoiding me. 

i don't know what to do. i just need to move and get the hell out of here asap. i do not think i will be inviting her along with me. in fact, i don't think i can even stand being in a relationship with her after this. unless she shows some serious sincere understanding of the shit she caused. but i know her values and way of thinking, and she's very stubborn. it's not going to happen. goddamn even ruining our lives probably won't make her change.

anyway. gonna go build a time machine so i can have never moved in with her, there's basically no other way to fix this.

edit 2: i commented a reply to someone that got a bit long, copying it here. (tl;dr i broke it off with her)

honestly, yes she used to be pretty hot. last few months she's been gaining weight and got fat now. that's just extra incentive to leave i decided. realistically i don't think i could possibly not have this whole clusterfuck be the first thing on my mind whenever i'm around her. i'm so pissed off. i'm getting a consultation with an attorney first thing tomorrow to see if/how i can legally protect myself against landlord's lawsuit for damages so that it's her responsibility. i already told her i don't want to see her. i don't care if she goes back to the apartment, she can have it. i've left everything there except my electronics and some personal items. they can burn it all, i don't care. as of tonight i'm temporarily staying with a very generous friend (after thoroughly showering at the gym, of course) who i'm unspeakably grateful to. it'll be a pain to replace my clothes, and furniture once i find a new place, but i know where to get cheap shit that will do for now. i have some emergency savings. guess this is exactly the kind of thing that's for. and fortunately i still have my job which is more than she can say.",7
"calling people beautiful because they have a disability or deformity that severely affects the way they look is stupid. whenever there's a video online of someone suffering some sort of awful condition that leaves them looking abnormal or disfigured, everyone seems to desperately flock to the comments to call them beautiful, stunning, gorgeous etc. this is stupid for a couple of reasons.

if you are calling them beautiful because of the way they look, you are not only lying to them but also yourself. no, they are not attractive, and they shouldn't have to be constantly lied to. i understand that people are saying these things with good intention, but instead of complimenting their appearance, how about actually praising the individual for going through life with this tough condition, or praising them for spreading awareness of it. that way, you aren't lying to them by saying they are pretty, but you are still supporting them.

if you are calling them beautiful because of their personality, and the way they deal with their condition, then it's equally as bad. you are seeing them online. you don't know the person. there is some sort of strange idea that because someone suffers from something, they must be a great person. this is not true. just because you watch a 2 minute video on someone and feel bad for the things they are going through, does not justify calling them beautiful in any way.",6
"i got genital herpes when i was 13 years old.. i lost my virginity while simultaneously getting herpes when i was 13. my older sister guilt tripped me into telling my parents that i had it (as she was in the doctor's office with me). she believes that kids shouldn't hide anything from their parents.

my narcissistic step dad called me all the promiscuous names (euphemism) and told me that he personally would never date a woman who had herpes. he told me good luck finding someone who would ever love me. my mom proceeded to beat me with a stick she found in the garage. my sister provided no emotional support. my at-the-time boyfriend proceeded to post all about how he didn't have herpes on facebook (despite how i told him to keep it between us and how he was the only person i ever slept with).

that fucked me up for a very long time. i was extremely suicidal and self harmed for a few years. but on the bright side, i no longer talk to any of the aforementioned people and am extremely happy with my life now. i'm going to to the school of my dreams on a full ride and can't ever consider killing myself like i did as a kid.

"my almost 3 month old daughter has been subpoenaed to testify in a criminal case. last thursday a process server came to our house and served a subpoena for a criminal case on my daughter, who was born on april 15, 2015. i called the number on it to explain how it must be a mistake because my daughter is not even 3 months old yet but i was told there was no mistake and my daughter is required to appear as a witness to testify on the date shown on the subpoena. i went in person with my daughter to the da's office and was told the same thing. my husband and i thought this might be a case of identity theft. she doesn't have a social security number yet because she was born at 29 weeks, spent 11 weeks in the nicu and has only been home from the hospital for 7 days so we haven't gotten around to it yet. we checked anyway just in case and one has not be created for her or issued to her. nothing with her credit either. we called the police about it possibly being identity theft and they are looking into it but so far there is nothing and they also told us the subpoena is legitimate.  so we are very confused. my daughter has a rare and uncommon first, middle and last name, so it is very doubtful that there someone else with her exact name. when i called the number on the subpoena and went to the da's office i was told both times that if she doesn't show up for court a warrant will be issued for her arrest. would the police actually arrest a baby for not showing up in court? or would my husband and i as her parents be arrested instead? does anyone have an explanation for what is happening here or any advice as to what we can do to solve this? i swear i'm not trolling, i wouldn't believe this myself except it is actually happening to us. we are in california.",2
"trigger warning. i don't know what to do. initially consensual sex became nightmare.. i went to a coworkers party tonight and got very drunk. it seemed like a very safe environment. another coworker and i were flirting hard (after months of sexual tension) and he asked me to come to the bathroom with him where we kinda fooled around but not really because i felt super uncomfortable about it. he asked me what sexual things i like. i felt silly but i told him, which included that i like to be submissive. we talked about other things and left the bathroom.

we get an uber and leave together. i remember that, and i remember when we started to have sex. and then everything got bad.

he asked to have anal with me. i said no. 

he wouldn't stop asking. and then he had his hands deep in my hair and was pulling super hard, he was slapping me without asking and on my face, choking, and all the while wanted to penetrate me anally. i kept saying no. a few times he tried to pretend to mishear me when he said ""where to you want it?"" 

as i rejected him, he'd get more forceful. he choked more, and i became truly scared, like he was drunk enough to really hurt me, choke me too long.... he finally put me on him, held me tight, holding my head tight against his, and said ""you are going to do this"". when he did it, he pulled my hair super hard, and made me say ""yes, sir"". he didn't use lube.

from that point forward i had no choice. i felt more scared than i ever have and i just did what he wanted and hoped he'd just finish and stop. the bed was covered in my hair, he pulled so much of it out. he didn't end up orgasming.

he fell asleep abruptly but it took me a little time to be brave enough to make a run for it. i left his place as quietly as i could and got an uber home. the first thing i did was write here.

he's a super well liked person in our company and i think he'd be believed over me because i'm newer and he didn't cum so i can't do a rape kit and the first part of our sexual interaction was consensual.

"i believe someone has set up a virtual intercept for my phone. i think they can receive and send texts from my number. $8.5k has been stolen from my bank account. help!. first, about 6 months ago, $5.5k was taken out of my checking account via ach. chase refunded it and i closed out the account and spent a month reconnecting all of my finances that used that account. this just happened again with $3k from my new account. the first time it showed up as a paypal payment and this time it showed up as a venmo payment, but neither showed up on my paypal or venmo account. 

i believe someone somehow has access to my phone number? is this possible? they can send and receive texts from my number i believe. there are a few reasons why: there was a few months where i would receive calls from numbers that were very similar to mine (the area code and first 3 digits were the same). i finally answered some of them, and they were usually the same, i would say hello, and the person on the line would be sound confused and say, ""hello who is this?"" i asked 2 of them how they got my number and one of them said they got a text from their son from this number and was calling back. also, i just reset my venmo and paypal password again to be super secure, and when i went to get a verification code, it came from two different numbers, 86753 (which is legit because i've received all my notifications from that number), but another text came from 16466796281 with the verification code. i feel like this one is fake. i'm guessing they are brute forcing my password and using my phone number somehow to 2 step verify? my passwords are way better now than they were before and aren't brute forceable anymore.

has anyone heard of a scam like this? is there a way to see if someone is using my number somehow? is there anything else i can do? thanks!

edit: it sounds like from the comments the phone calls and the bank fraud are separate issues, although i am not fully convinced based on the timing. i believe my chase login was compromised. i have changed passwords for chase, venmo, paypal, google and made them even more secure. i use lastpass for all of my logins. i am also getting a bunch of people saying sms 2 factor authentication is awful. i'm going to use google authenticator where possible. i still have a hard time believing sms is worse than email authentication. any proof on that would be appreciated.

edit 2: thanks everyone! it's crazy that a lot of people are going through the same phone spoofing ordeal. there has been a ton of great advice. i'm still trying to read through all of it. this sub is awesome!

edit 3: some more info, immediately after the money was stolen, i checked chase and venmo and it looked like i had unauthorized logins on both of them. on venmo i was able to remove all of the devices. for chase i had to call support, but they were able to clear all saved devices as well. i never got any validation texts for logins. this keeps pointing me back to someone having access to my phone. i'm going to go into t-mobile today.",10
"for watching a wwe pay per view (money in the bank) on my phone while at a wedding that was meaningless to me?. so this goes back almost a month now to may 19th but my wife and mom are still so furious with me that my wife may divorce me and my mom may take her side over it. i need some honest feedback to help me go forward. 

i'm a huge wwe fan and i pretty much get all the ppv. money in the bank, there was a ton i wanted to see but it also culminates several story lines into a ladder match that i really wanted to see. it was may 19th and i made it very clear i wanted to watch the event. on may 9th my wife announced that shed been invited to a coworkers wedding and i had to go with her (by a crazy coincidence that we didn't know until we got there, the grooms mom is my moms good friend). i assumed the wedding woukd be on saturday so i agreed. well saturday the 18th came and went and it wasn't until the 19th when my wife was pissed i wasn't getting ready that i was like oh shit, i can't go because of rhe ppv. she got so mad at me so i relented and went. 

it was one of those events where there i didn't know a single person besides my wife and my mom and rhe groom was sort of a dick. so after he sort of blew me off when i tried to congratulate him i was like fuck this and i got out my phone, parked myself in the corner and bought the ppv. my wife and now mom kept trying to get me away and be social and finally i got pissed and told them both to leave me the fuck alone. 

things honest to god haven't been the same since. she says i looked like such and asshole with my phone in my face in a semi-dark room while everyone else was having fun and dancing. my mom says her friends all noticed me and commented that i must have been autistic or retarded so she's massively embarrased. 

to me i had plans, i did my part to attend and when i didn't know anyone i made the best of a bad situation to do what i wanted anyways.

was i the asshole?


edit: 

to address the common repeats:

1. no i don't do network, my wife would come unglued if i have 24/7 access to something she hates so much. i still do ppv even though its more expensive. 

2. invitation was only 10 days in advance because the bride claims she just ""forgot"" to send our invitation and only realized at the last minute when ""we"" hadn't rsvp'd. that's the bride and my wife's story, believe it if you do or don't. 

3. yes it was a crazy coincidence my mom was at the wedding. but since we got a late invite and i don't speak with my mom all that often i would have no way of knowing in advance. the bride is my wife's coworker, the groom's mom is my mom' friend from some charity they work on together. i'd never met any of them.

"i 28m think my girlfriend 26f of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.. i saw their messages last week and i haven't been the same since. 

i borrowed her old ipad for work purposes and her facebook account was still logged in the device. i was going to log in on my messenger because i forgot my phone at home and i was going to message her but then i saw that she had messages from her ex-boyfriend. let's call him andre. 

her and andre dated for two years. they were each other's first love and she never told me what happened between them. i met her a year and some months after they broke up when i went on a trip with my family to california. 

i didn't know anything about him other than the fact that they dated sometime in high school and college.

when i met her, we instantly hit it off, she showed me around la and me living in australia wasn't a problem. we were in a long distance relationship for a year until i saved up enough money to move out of my country for her. other than that, it took me months to look for a job in los angeles so that i would be financially secure when i got there.

three years later, we're still going strong. or so i thought.

when i clicked on their conversation out of curiousity, i immediately noticed the kiss and heart emojis. right then i knew what was happening. i don't wanna go on about the details but the only message that stood out was her talking about leaving me for a few months so that she could take care of him. he has cancer, it's at stage 1 but he reckons he's going to die. on one of his messages to her, he asked if she would visit him in his house.

and i'm pretty sure she did because they mentioned how they had a great time together and that it was good to catch up. 

well, it's been a week since i found out. she doesn't know that i know, or that i took her old ipad out of its box and that i had spent two days reading their messages. she has no idea at all.

she thinks everything is okay between us but i actually want to cry for a long time and that i want to physically hurt myself. i have no friends in la, all of them are back home and they're all living their own lives now. i don't wanna talk about it to anyone because thinking too deeply about it hurts. 

i guess when it all comes down to it, she never really loved me and i'm still trying to accept that. 

i don't know how to approach this. i have written my resignation letter for work and i have messaged my parents that i was going to go home sometime next month. i did both when i was extremely upset. 

i just need advice on how to approach this. i don't wanna talk to her about it, at all. i can't even look her in the eye without wanting to break down. please help me on what to do and how to approach it correctly. as of now, i'm thinking of leaving while she's at work. ",7

"i 24f am dating a 25m an almost unreasonably picky eater and i'm pretty much at the end of my rope. &#x200b;

tl;dr: my partner exclusively eats pizza.

&#x200b;

i \24f\ met jake \25m\ about two years ago while out and bonding over the fact that we graduated from the same college. we went on a couple dates and were getting to know each other when he let me know that he had more or less eaten pizza every day for the past three years. i didn't love the idea but i thought he was pretty cool besides that and figured it was just a little quirk he had that he was, exaggerating and that the dude just really liked pizza.

&#x200b;

he was not.

&#x200b;

he eats it every single day without fail. each time we go out, it has to be pizza and after a few fights here and there, it's been pretty much an unspoken understanding that when we go out we will be getting pizza. also, it's not just any pizza, he's even picky about his pizza. he'll make us go to a few totally inconvenient pizza places that requires a subway ride trip and is far from where either of us live. we live in nyc and i'm sure most of you know you pretty much can't pass a single block without stumbling upon a pizza place, so it's not like these places are our only options.

&#x200b;

i can name all the foods he eats on both my hands. all are simple carbohydrates, but pizza is his absolute favorite. the others he'll just settle to eat if pizza is not immediately available. no vegetables, no fruit, no protein, whatsoever. he absolutely refuses to even try them despite never trying most of them before. 

&#x200b;

i've tried to gently push his boundaries, but it always fails and the one time we went somewhere i wanted to go he pouted the entire time and ordered french fries. he's promised to be more open and that this pizza thing won't be forever, but that it's working for him now (whatever that means.) he claims to be high functioning on the spectrum which honestly, i'm not totally convinced of but that's another story, and that's why he can only eat pizza. this made me more cautious of discussing my issues with his diet because i know how easily he can claim i'm insensitive to his disability and that it's something he truly cannot help, and he has. i do firmly believe he has some sort of avoidant eating disorder, that is clearly not debatable.

&#x200b;

i've more or less dropped it because it always starts a fight, but the resentment is still there. something i wasn't totally sold on when we first met but convinced myself was a small quirk is turning into genuine disgust and bitterness towards him and his unwillingness. i guess he thought i got over it since i stopped bringing it up as much, and he informed me of his plan to stop eating pizza everyday after 10,000 consecutive days of eating pizza. to do the math for you, that's roughly around 2040 factoring in the days he's already gained. he's going to document it on his instagram story and show everybody his ""streak."" 

&#x200b;

he seemed so proud of this idea and commitment and i'm genuinely stunned. he thinks this is just some interesting, cute little tidbit about him that people will support because ""he's such an offbeat guy."" i could not believe what i was hearing. taking away the inconvenience of always having to eat where he wants to eat, not being able to cook for us, me being bored stupid over eating the same shit every time, it's simply not healthy. he claims because he's outwardly fit it's not a big deal, but i disagree. 

&#x200b;

i was sort of putting up with the whole pizza thing at first but upon this announcement, i don't know if i can i deal with this much longer. it's inconvenient, it's unhealthy, and in my opinion it's selfish. everybody you go to eat out with has to cater to a single person's self imposed dietary restrictions. he's going to germany with his family for vacation and he's already mapped out the available pizza places he can eat at (german pizza over authentic german cuisine?!). it very well could be something he can't help, and he has claimed to be getting help through therapy with it but i'm seeing no progress and honestly i don't think he wants to and only says he's working on it to placate me. he talks about having a future with me and having kids, and there's no way i would even consider that if he continues to commit to this streak, for the fear of setting a bad example for our children's eating habits. 

&#x200b;

we don't live together and only see each other about three times a week and the pizza thing is driving me crazy. he proposed moving in together and i immediately shot that down for the time being. if i can barely handle it now i know living together would only amplify it.

&#x200b;

i've tried gently coaxing, i've tried showing him studies on how his diet affects his life and sets back the fitness goals he's always complaining about never reaching, i've tried fighting and anger only to be told i'm an asshole because i need to accept him as he is and that he can't help it. maybe he is right. i have to accept it or i have to move on, and at this point i truly don't think i can. he's great in almost every other way except for this. i feel guilty for letting it go on this long when it bothered me from the very beginning, but i can't change that now.

do i concede and let him eat whatever he wants as he's a grown man? should i draw this boundary and continue to push him to push himself and give an ultimatum? or do i just need to throw in the towel at this point and move on with my life?

"by mowing the lawn after a hurricane. hey reddit. as is tradition, this didn't happen today, rather it happened monday. 

so hurricane dorian happened. and my old man called me up to assist him in removing all the shite and detritus that was distributed all the fuck over the lawn. now. we have a shit load of trees on the property. the amount of branches, leaves, sticks, and acorns was beyond reason. after a few beers of cleaning up i got a bright idea. 

i am a lazy man, fuck doing this by hand, where is the lawn mower. my father is also a lazy man at times, so in the years since his free slave labour moved out (see: me and my brother) he bought himself a nice ride on mower to facilitate ease of rum and coke consumption during lawn maintenance activites. due to this, the old mower which has the ability to bag up cuttings instead of disbursing them was tucked away in the shed covered in several years worth of tools, boxes, cobwebs, and various other pains in the ass.

got that bad bitch out and took a gander at it. it had seen better years, the frame was bent slightly, and the little rubber flap at the back that prevents small objects from exiting the rear of the mower at a high rate of speed was nowhere to be found. likely in the same spot as my common sense and a heaping pot of foreshadowing. 

god tried to warn me. no matter what i did the thing would not turn over, however. armed with hubris and a bottle of quick start spray i got it sputtering to life, and with a chuckle to my self about how clever i was, i set to mowing. 

now. the records show in halifax there were no serious injuries due to hurricane dorian. the records are wrong. for the fateful moment i set that lawn mower to the grass, one of those little acorns was propelled at warp 6 out of the back of the mower, off the tip of my steel toed boot, and pinged my left testicle like a newton's cradle of pain. 

everything was fine for a few blissful seconds. as my molson canadian soaked neurons attempted to process the incoming genital distress beacon before my world turned white. i'm sure i don't need to tell you this next part because i'm certain i screamed so loud they heard my 100% manly cries  on the international space station. 

i dropped like a sack of lead potatoes, wailing like a wounded hyena, and promptly evacuated the remaining inexpensive domestic lager from within my stomach, thankfully managing to miss my self. 

lucky for me i never intended on having kids.

"update: i married my wife because i owe her family around $10,000. yesterday night, i posted a thread:
http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2cy4fg/i_married_my_wife_because_i_owe_her_family_around/

today, i took my wife out to lunch for our anniversary. when i saw her cute face, i immediately felt different. this was due to the fact that my thread blew up with lots of advise yesterday night. 

i want to thank you guys and girls. you know who you are. you made me think of my wife differently today. it was the first time that i actually told her i loved her without forcing myself to say it. at first, i muttered it under my breath and my wife asked what i said. i tried a second time and again, i couldn't speak up. then i said it loud for the third time. my wife smiled and her face turned all pink. 

we remained quiet for a little while until she began to ask me about my day. we talked for a little while before we visit her parents. i told her parents that i would start paying them back for the car they had bought me when i was in my teens. they told me not to worry about it; that they were happy that i remember and visit them even though it wasn't their anniversary. we talked for a couple of hours.

my wife and i returned home. it was then that i opened internet explorer and asked my wife to look at my thread. we sat down together and she read it. she began to cry while reading it and hugged me so tight. the last time i saw her cry was on our wedding night and it was ""tears of joy"" according to her. 

i told her that i realized that i was treating her unfairly. i told her i wanted to be more loving towards her. i told her i loved her and she was my life. she told me that i was her life, that i saved her from killing herself, and that without me she wouldn't be happy. at this point, i was crying.

my wife is currently sleeping. 

to conclude, i want to thank you all again for the advise. for the people that told me to pay back my debts and leave her, i have realized that i will stick by my wife till death do us part like i had promised her 10 years ago. she is my life right now and i don't want to have anyone by my side than her.

good-night all.

"i went from being jobless and 43k in debt to a job, wife, house, child, and debt free in 2.5 years - all under 60k in salary.. maybe this can inspire someone who needs it.


june 2013 -  i had just decided to ""retire"" (change jobs) from being a college campus minister, and so i had no job and 43k in debt (25k in student loans, the rest on credit cards).  the only ""asset""  i had was my 1986 nissan 300zx, which was breaking down from my lack of money to maintain it. i was engaged and knew i had to do something so after 3 months of job searching i finally got a job doing it work (i have an associates degree in it)  in another city.  i was offered 42k a year salary. i move there and live with some family friends to save money and save up for a car. after 2 months i buy a 99 nissan altima for 2k cash. not much money went into debt except the required monthly payments.



august 2013 - i get married and my wife and i find an apartment to move into the week before our wedding.  we looked at some really dumpy places for $600 a month, but i didn't feel safe in those neighborhoods at pretty much any time of day. so we settled on a apartment in a somewhat nicer part of town, closer to my work, that was $800 a month. that was as low as i could go and be comfortable living in my own apartment.


this is when things really start to take off.  my wife is a very frugal person (she lived in africa for a few years with nothing), and we help each other when we wanted to give in. we took most of the money we received from our wedding and put it towards the debt, starting of course with the highest interest cc. mine weren't too bad honestly since i've always had good credit even with the really high utilization.  the most i was paying was about 13% (it's crazy to me now that i ever paid that much)

we saved everywhere we could. for the first months she stayed home and found every way to save money to put towards debt. she cooked every meal, and we didn't do anything but spend time with each other(worked out for the newlyweds).  we had a strict budget and spent that to the dollar. she would go through the grocery ads and find things on sale and that's what we ate that week.  we only had 1 car (my old one being broken), and so i drove to work and back and that was it. no where else unless we had to go.   i made my own lunch every day (while all my co-workers went out) and we didn't go out drinking or really anywhere. we might go see our family and friends but we never ate out. we did have a tv i owned, but we just used an ota antenna i had and watched our movies we already had on dvd. 

pretty much the only items in our budget were rent, water/sewer, electricity, internet service (lowest i could get), groceries, gas , car insurance, and then debt. my work paid for my cell phone and i got my wife a republic wireless phone that cost $12 a month using our internet. 



nov 2013 - i get my wife a part time job at my work, making $10 an hour.  she has a degree in nursing but we wanted to have kids so we always planned for her to stay home.  since she works at my workplace, we keep the 1 car and ride together.  now she brings home around $800 a month which all goes to paying the debt. i also start getting some overtime at my job and that helps a little as well.  we are literally paying maybe close to 2k or more a month now to the debt.


oct 2014 - a year has gone by and all the credit card debt is all paid off, and we are just working on my much lower interest student loan debt. but now we find out my wife is pregnant!  we are so happy but we really don't want to raise a child in our apartment in a sketchy part of town.  in the year or so we've been there, we'd seen some bad things that would make you shudder. so we consider how we could buy a house in a better neighborhood. we decided that a home right now was more important than the debt temporarily, especially since all the loans were under 6% interest (majority of it was at 3%). also they kept raising the rent on us and it had gotten to over $900 a month. 

i also was getting some overtime at my job, but i was moving up quickly.  i was able to negotiate a 9% in place raise when i set up a meeting to review my hourly rate. this put me up around 47k and maybe a little more with overtime.  so instead of saving now for the debt, we stopped and started saving for the house. just put the minimal in all the student loans.  also i did fix up myself my old 86 nissan, and so we had 2 cars now.  this was good so that my wife could stay home more days and rest and go out if needed.


jan 2015 - so we start looking for a home with a realtor, though i'm not sure why.  we did all the work looking through homes and all he did was just set up the times to go look at them. we went out about 5 saturdays and looked at about 6 homes each time.  we would find one we really liked in our price range but then someone else would get it. or there were ones we liked and weren't under contract, but they weren't willing to negotiate down in price.  then one day i found this perfect house randomly on a website, for sale by owner.  i drive by and there's not even a for sale sign on it so i have my realtor talk to him and we negotiated an offer for 219k.  it was a high amount for what is usually considered reasonable by this sub, but i knew i was going to be making more money soon and with our current budget, paying that mortgage wasn't that much more than our rent. 


april 2015- we closed on the house, the seller to pay all the closing costs, we even got a home warranty in there for free. we had only enough cash for 10% down, and i accepted that since the pmi wasn't much with my credit score.  and i was able to get 3.75%  interest on the house with no points, which was great. i spent $80 on a moving truck and did it all ourselves.  


may 2015 - we started putting that extra money back towards the debt again, though obviously less than before. and my wife had stopped working around here, so we lost that extra $800 a month. 

july 2015 - baby born!  this threw a big cost at us, since my work's health insurance deductible was at $5000.  i had some of that in my hsa, but 4k or more came out of my pocket. plus all the other expenses that come with a baby,it was a stretch but not too bad. our good budgeting helped immensely.


august 2015 -  the guy above my position was fired because he was horrible at his job and i was doing all the work for him.  they then promoted me to his position and pushed me up to 55k a year salary.  no more overtime, which sucked because it had really been helping us out. but i did get a bonus if the year was good. 


jan 2016 -  i made the last payment to the student loans. i got paid an extra paycheck and i got a bonus and that was enough to finish it off for good.  it was the greatest feeling, like i'm free!  and i found out we are having another baby! another $5k to pay, hah. 


so moral of the long story, you can do it on a reasonable salary. you find the cheapest place to live that you can, and you put everything to your debt. sell things, work extra hours, do whatever you can to get it gone asap. live as cheaply as possible, and it's a minute by minute decision. you don't need to spend $2 on a soda when water is free. you don't need to buy a new car when it won't cost that much to fix your old one. be determined and it can work. 

i left alot out because this is already too long, especially some specifics, feel free to ask and i'll try to reply. 


edit:  yes i agree title is misleading on having no debt, i owe $190k on my house still which is debt. 

edit 2 :  you can believe what you like,  but our wedding money was around 2k.  so we are talking about 30 months,  which is $60k of money at the average rate of 2k a month. sometimes more and sometimes less. and anything else i could get my hands on went to the debt. so this is definitely possible to do saying i paid off the 43k and put down 21k on the house in the 30 months time frame. i don't print money in my office,  obviously there are other things that help like tax returns,  bonuses,  christmas gifts,  some odd jobs, and sold some car parts. all things that are fortunate to have,  but something most people use for things other than debt. i know not everyone is as well off as even i was,  but i want people to know it's possible to get out of the hole if you work at it. every situation is different. the whole point is get out of debt by any means necessary as soon as possible.

so i've had this account for about 2 years now, but i never got into reddit until about midway through this year. i'm not entirely sure why i didn't get into it right off the bat but i started using reddit regularly when i downloaded the app. i know that the app is flooooded with ads, and i agree that is a problem, but i just prefer the accessibility of the app so much more. i don't know if it is just me who feels this way, but the layout of the website just feels very cluttered, dated, and unorganized. with the app i know where everything is, and it's all laid out in a way that makes everything easy to navigate.

i have 7,000 dollars in my personal bank account, and about 5,000 dollars in a joint account with my wife. i have a good paying job right now where i bring home about 600/week, (2,500/month). we also have really good health insurance from there. my wife just started a part time job giving horse riding lessons.

our monthly expenses include 825/rent, 65/electric, 160/auto insurance, 200/food, 80/miscellaneous.

i will lose my job and most likely will not get rehired by them once i get out. i will have at least 2,000 in fines once i'm out. i will only find out september 5th what the full extent of this will be.

"for telling my disabled son and his partner i disapprove of their relationship?. i'm fully prepared to be called an asshole.

my son is 23 and has cerebral palsy that is quite severe. it only affects him physically. he is very smart. i have recently setup his financials where he gets his disability sent to  him directly and got him his own place. 

his caregiver visits him daily at his new place. i did this because i wanted my son to be independent. 

he did very well for a few months but recently he has gotten into a relationship with a 58 year old man that i simply do not approve of.

it's not that i'm homophobic. but it's the fact that this man older then me has now moved in with my son. they've only known each other for three months.

and what's worse is that my son isn't gay. i had a heartfelt conversation where my son broke down and admitted he isn't gay but is scared of dying alone.

i have been heartbroken ever since and tried to setup some counseling sessions only to find out that his partner is double booking activities on those days and forcing my son to choose.

i'm not sure what this older man's deal is. he is contributing around 25% of the rent and seems to work.

last sunday i had them over for lunch and i couldn't control myself. i called him a predator and i thought he was disgusting. he then proceeded to take it on himself to physically push my son out the house without even asking.

my son called me after and said that what i did was wrong and i don't understand his predicament.

every instinct in me is telling me that man is bad news. 

i'm contemplating reporting him to the authorities. but that might be going too far and my son will likely resent me.

was i really the asshole for calling out that creep like that? 

all i want is for my son to be happy. and right now, i really don't think this situation with a man he isn't attracted to is making him happy. but he is 23 and i may have overstepped.",3

"my (25) mother is completely financially dependent and it's affecting the whole family. obligatory throw-away account.  

bottom line, my mom is financially unstable and i want to know what resources there are to begin to fix it. i know there is no overnight fix but i'm not sure where to begin. 

she has gotten herself tremendously into debt and relies completely on my step-dad financially. she has a great job actually making more than he does, but she relies on him for food and a roof over her head. her bi-weekly paycheck may last at most a week. they have had marital issues for a while and if he leaves i have no idea what will happen to her or my teenage brother. inevitably i will end up having to completely support her and i want to get help before it comes to that. he has told me they probably will end it once my brother graduates high school (less than 3 years). she has virtually no financial knowledge and is completely uninterested in becoming financially independent/stable to my knowledge. she also has not seen any repercussions as someone is always there to give her money when she can't make rent, etc. 

i recently found out that my step-dad has only been putting minimal effort into keeping her accountable. he is (we think) aware of what loans/etc. she has and has provided her with a budget, but still keeps having to give her money beyond what he should. he states he has has no idea where the extra cash is going but admits to not following through to find out. she has filed bankruptcy twice and has taken out many payday loans. but i do not know yet the actual extent of how bad her situation is.... i'm under the impression that she is not being entirely honest with him.

i have only very basic financial knowledge myself, so i want to have all the resources and knowledge i can before i confront her. i want to protect the future of myself and my own family. 

we are in the us if that matters. 

tldr; mom is severely in debt and financially dependent on step-dad. most likely divorcing soon. need to know what resources there are to help her become financially stable before she becomes completely dependent on me. 




edit: wow... i am struggling to find the right words. reading as many comments/messages as i could during breaks at work, i've been fighting back tears of relief all day. 

i want to genuinely thank each and every one of you for taking the time to not only read this long depressing post, but offer your suggestions and support. this has been a dark cloud of anticipation over my head for quite some time (parents have been rocky for a while). i saw the future i've worked so hard to build for myself being slowly ripped away with every paycheck. i posted this expecting a couple responses with websites and types of financial advisors so i could do more research when i got home from work. but instead... this beauty. the idea that i would be hurting more than helping never crossed my mind, nor did the glaring fact that she doesn't *want* to be helped. why would she? she's got the gig. but also the fact i was most blind to... that this is her problem and not mine. 

i plan to talk to my step-dad tomorrow. i know he believes he's helping the family rather than enabling her. i'll give him the insight and build him up like you guys built me up, but also let him do with that what he will. because i've got my own stability to worry about!!!! they're grown!!

"by busting a nut in the middle of my gym. i'm a pretty fit guy, but i've been toking a little too much lately and decided i need to occupy my time with more productive and healthy habits i.e. exercising.

so today i was in my school's gym (i go to a small d3 college on the west coast) doing my usual workout routine, and i got to the portion where i do two one-minute wall sits. the first one went fine, i felt a little shakier than normal but i'm sleep deprived so i figured that was why. 

the second wall sit, however, was significantly more difficult than i'm used to. there were 5 seconds left, i was boring holes into the clock with my eyes, and my legs were shaking like a senile chihuahua's. when the clock finally hit the one minute mark, i stood up, and came in my pants.

literally.

it was so bizarre. the trembling started in my groin where the majority of the pain was and then moved in between my legs, and i just came. my dick was.soft the whole time. 

so there i was, standing up, legs crossed, probably looking like a fucking creep.  luckily my compressions kept everything...contained...but i still got a weird look or two. 

i can never leave my dorm again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 

tl;dr i got super shaky during my workout and had a spontaneous orgasm in the middle of my gym in front of several people and now i can't be seen in public anymore

edit: i left out the fact that did actually orgasm- some people are under the impression that i literally squeezed the golden glue out of my balls. if that were the case, i'd be in the hospital not on reddit

"update seattle, wa- mentally disabled neighbor has twice followed us to our front door and attempted to enter. what are our options?. original post(https://redd.it/8san7h).

thank you all so much for your help and suggestions. first, a few things to clear up:

-we are not trigger-happy people looking to kill our neighbors (contrary to what a few comments and nasty pms said). my husband has a handgun because he enjoys going shooting, and for protection. i am not thrilled, but as long as he is safe about it, it's not worth fighting over.

-we did not know the man was mentally disabled until after the first incident. i feel our fear was justified given that a strange man followed us and our toddler home and then tried to open our door and window.

-i actually have quite a bit of compassion for the elderly and the disabled. i went to the house to speak with the caretaker to figure out how we could all keep this from happening again. i understand his hesitancy to give me any info, but i was trying to help the man rather than get the caretaker fired or have his license taken.

onto the update:

after posting here, i followed the top suggestion to contact adult protective services and filed a report. after filing the report, aps also referred me to the complaint resolution unit, which deals directly with caretakers and aides under investigation. because this had happened twice in three days, aps moved fast to visit the home and get in contact with the agency running the group home (note: they kept calling it a group home, but as far as i can tell, the man who followed us is the only resident there). the agency was very apologetic and horrified that these escapes had led to police contact twice. i was told alarms have been installed on all exterior doors so staff is alerted when he tries to escape. they will be bringing in additional staff as well, to ensure that this man has 2 aides assigned to him at all times.

the aps investigator let me know that the man is non-verbal and only understands very simple instructions, so simply asking him to leave our property wouldn't work. she mentioned that he hates being alone and probably latched onto our family because we looked safe. apparently he also loves dogs and she thinks that's what caused him to come over the second time (we were in the front yard with our dog). moving forward, i will be trying to arrange a meeting with the agency to come up with a plan in case this happens again. i'd rather not involve the police if i don't have to, so hopefully they will give me a number to call if he appears at our house again. ultimately i'm very glad that this man will be getting the care he deserves and needs.",2

"looking after a drunk friend (nsfw). so this actually happened today. well, tonight, i mean. i've just gotten out of scrubbing myself in the shower and am ready to talk about tonight's efforts.

so i went out for dinner alone tonight. i figured that i could go catch a set of my friend's band playing and have dinner and a few quiet drinks. once out, i run into two female friends who were on the sauce. i had a few mojitos, they had a good dozen shots each. we're having a good night, i decide to head further uptown with them as they're keen for the dancing and my buddy djs at the club they were wanting to go to.

once we start walking though, things change. all of a sudden, one of the girls - let's call her amy - has all the alcohol hit her. she's barely able to stand, i end up giving her a piggyback ride the three or so blocks to the cab rank. you'd think her friend she went out with - we'll call her mary - would see this and want to put her in a cab, right? nope, she's been getting more and more pissed that i've been paying attention just to amy and wants amy to just go to the clubs with her. straight away. not after she's had a few minutes rest. right now.

luckily, we're at the cab rank at this point, mary storms off to go clubbing by herself, leaving me with an amy that can't even stand up straight. i get her in the cab and get in after her, ignoring all the glares and catcalls i'm getting from everyone around that think i'm going to take her home and molest her (welcome to australia, where if you're an ugly guy with a drunk girl, everyone immediately assumes you're about to take advantage of her).

as soon as the cab takes off, she falls asleep on my shoulder. 'excellent' i think, 'this should be easy, i'll get her to her house, then her boyfriend can look after her and i'll head back out'. within thirty seconds, she starts throwing up in her sleep. all over the cab, all over me, in my hair, in my mouth. the cabbie is justifiably furious. i hand him the cleaning fee of $150 he is demanding in order to keep driving, then when we finally get to her house he kicks us out, not before demanding another $50 for the fare (even though the meter said it was a $12.70 fare).

amy jumps out and flops face-down into the dirt before i can even get out of my side of the car. then she starts puking again. as i'm desperately trying to get her onto her side and keep her airways clear, she starts yelling at me to get her shoes off because she can't walk with them on.

which is when her boyfriend (that i've never met) opens the door and comes downstairs to see me hunched over his paralytic girlfriend, trying to take her shoes off while she's kicking and screaming to get them off so she can go inside.

luckily this guy takes a few seconds, realises what's going on and understands i'm not trying to assault his girlfriend and gets me to help carry her inside and get her into the bathtub. at this point i'm still wearing his girlfriend's vomit like the world's shittiest brand of beard oil, but once she's in the bathroom, i'm out on the street. dude does not want me around, which i suppose is fair enough. i mean, if a strange man showed up on the doorstep with my drunk girlfriend i'd be pretty pissed about the situation too.

but either way, i'm now out on the street, covered in vomit and in a strange part of town that i don't know. after wandering around lost for twenty minutes, i finally found a lift home and got a well-deserved shower. and now i'm finishing typing this story up for all you fine folks.

tl;dr - helped a drunk friend, got treated like a date-rapist, had to pay cleaning fees after she vomited all over the cab and myself, got turfed out in the middle of the night in a strange part of town still covered in said vomit.

edit: wow, i did not expect this to blow up like this. i'm at work at the moment, but i'll read what everyone has said when i get home tonight. 

but if i could ask everyone to do one small favour for me, it's go and do something nice for someone today please. betting nice feels good.  :)

2nd edit: thank you for the gold, kind strangers!

3rd edit: now that i'm home i can actually read through the thread and wow, there's a lot here. for all those who have given kind words, thank you so much, it's super appreciated. for everyone asking why i posted the story, it was really only because i've read so many stories on here that have made me laugh, shocked me or made me feel for the people writing them, i honestly just hoped that maybe one or two people might have gotten a little chuckle out of it before it got deleted by the mods/faded into reddit history. it certainly wasn't to big up myself or try to shame anyone. it has been interesting to read all the different responses here though.

and for the people who wanted to know how the vomit got in my mouth, that was when we were in the cab sitting next to each other, she put her hand over her mouth while vomiting and some of it splashed/squeezed out the side, right onto my face as i was apologizing to the taxi driver. absolutely a fluke shot, i guess if dude perfect ever want to do vomit videos she could get a job with them, haha.

for the people asking about lyft/uber, for the most part in australia they are only in the capital cities. i live in a regional town in queensland of about 60,000 people, neither of those companies are expanding here any time soon unfortunately.

i spoke to both the girls briefly today and they're certainly feeling more than a little embarrassed (and hungover). amy has offered to transfer what she can now and will pay me back the rest on thursday when she's paid. she's a good egg.",4
"for eating a lot at a wedding buffet?. i (17m) eat a good amount of food. based on my body type and physical activity, i've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.

my aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. it was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/dj meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.

this was problematic because i needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as i had only been excused for the morning one. i ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. i only ate a protein bar during the drive, so i was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.

i loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. i was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. she had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if i was still hungry i could make something when we got home.

now, i would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. i ate a good amount, but i doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.

she eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. i would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. there was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.

once we left, my mom went on a rant about how i was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" i told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and i wasn't depriving anyone else since i went back for more once most people were done.

i'm not sure if i violated some social norm, but i feel like i was justified. aita, reddit?

edit: i don't know if this matters, but i was mainly eating chicken and lamb, not veggies or rice/bread. there was still some leftover, though.",3
"my (blonde) sister hates blonde jokes. i (redhead) told her i have a redhead joke for her. she was eager to hear it!. a redhead goes for a drive through the country, just enjoying the peaceful ride with her windows open. she has to stop as a shepherd is moving his flock across the road. the redhead gets out of her car to stretch and has an idea.

""hey mister! if i can guess how many sheep you have, may i keep one?""

the shepherd has hundreds of sheep and feels confident enough to agree.  the redhead looks over the flock and says, ""361.""  the shepherd is stunned that she guessed correctly but, being a man of his word, allows her to pick out her favorite.  the redhead is about to put her new pet in her car when the shepherd calls out to her.

"i got visited by some agency, and i don't know what to do. hi! i'm a lurker on reddit most of the time, and i didn't plan on getting an account until this absolutely surreal experience a couple of days ago. i live in an apartment building near atlanta if that helps. 

i was visited by this government agency i've never heard of called tsa, it's not the airport one since i've haven't travelled via plane for years now, and because i don't think tsa officers can visit peoples homes. they said they were law enforcement, and that they needed to search my apartment but i didn't let them in because i've never heard of an agency called the tsa other than the airport one.

they showed me a warrant, but i still didn't let them in. eventually, they called for someone, and someone from the fbi came from their office in atlanta, they showed their card and they were from something called gema-hs, i don't know what that stands for. they got in contact with the police which confirmed the warrant, and i allowed them to enter my apartment.

they did a search then left. am i in trouble because i haven't done anything wrong, i'm a grad student and i can't afford for something to go on my record.

i'm still pretty confused as their uniforms had an emblem on it with 3 mountains and the uniforms they were wearing did not resemble law enforcement uniforms but rather they were wearing very professional suits and i didn't see any weapons on them.

edit: i contacted the atlanta bar association's attorney referral line as directed to by u/triceratops. they put me in contact with an attorney whom i've spoken to, and he's told me to not speak about the case anymore. we've set up an initial consultation meeting, and i would like to thank everyone who helped me sort this out. i was totally lost in the beginning and had no idea what to do, but you guys gave me guidance and helped me out during my time of need and for that i am very grateful! 

about the co leak, i called the fire department and they said they're already at my apartment assessing the leak. the utility company has also been called, and they're sending their own representatives as well. my friend took me to the hospital to get assessed for co poisoning, and i'm currently here and they're preforming some tests on me. thank you once again guys, once there's an update and i'm allowed by my attorney to speak on the matter, i'll be sure to update you guys!",2
"by missing the birth of my daughter. happened yesterday at 2am. 

so my wife was pregnant. i work from home in internet marketing so don't get out too too much, but she heard of a cool local tech conference and thought i should check it out. (important detail to remember)

the conference was 2.5hrs away in a neighbouring city. 

anyway.  she was 37 weeks pregnant (babies are typically cooked at 40), and has been feeling great so didn't see any issue with me being gone one night. like, what are the chances?

so me and a friend packed up and left for the conference at 1pm thursday for the evening networking. 

fast forward to 11pm, we're having a beer before heading to bed after the networking is over, and i get a call from my wife:

""i think my water broke.""

""umm.. what?!?""

we're still 3 weeks early so i say no you're probably not, go back to bed. did some quick searches and dr google said that because she wasn't having contractions, and she was otherwise feeling fine otherwise, it might just be pee from baby pressing on her bladder. no need to alarm. 

10 minutes later i get a text, ""contractions started and they hurt like hell. going to hospital now.""

she's home alone and has no way to get to the hospital so is thinking of calling an ambulance, so my friend says his wife will go pick her up and take her. i tell my wife what's going on and she agrees (she's almost incoherent at this point and can't talk or stand during contractions).

meanwhile, we grab our shit and hit the road. 2.5 hours, we should be able to make it in time for the birth. labors usually take 6-12 hours. no big deal. 

she gets to the hospital and they tell her that she's fully dilated and baby's already crowning. 

at this point they get her straight into a room (too late for an epidural), my friends wife gets me on facetime, and i watch in the passenger seat of a car via facetime my daughter being born in record time. 

total time from water breaking to delivered child: 2.25 hours. 

i missed it by an hour. we get there and come cruising in and i got to meet my exhausted wife and beautiful baby daughter. 

so good news, i have a beautiful, healthy baby girl, bad news is i wasn't physically there. but she can't get me in trouble because she sent me to the conference! 

tl;dr: wife sent me to a conference, didn't think we'd have a baby that early, ended up having a baby that early and i missed it.",4

* accident tore a hole through the roof and nicked the winshied. repairs were about $1000.  insurance deductible was $1000. i caught the incident on a dashcam that records speed, gps time, gps position.
* contacted idot with their form. idot referred me to istha.
* istha identified the location as under the control of company (we'll call them) ""jco""
* jco sends a letter saying that it wasn't in their area and it was in company ""kco's"" area.
* i call kco - they say ""nope""
* i get a call back from the local director of ""jco"" ( let's call him ""pos"" ) says it wasn't them and that someone else also had property damage that that kco is handling the issues and kco is the company to contact, not them.
* i send a letter to istha and include a map that identifies time and gps lat/lon location along with the note about the phone call.
* istha send a letter back to jco which states ""no - it's jco's area and handle this with the injured party directly and cc risk management with the details""
* 6 months go by - nothing. i follow up with a letter and a screenshot of the dashcam video with a mile-marker visible. asking for a response.
* jco says ""winds were 41 mph that day - not our responsibility""
* i follow back with this letter(https://imgur.com/a/pm3xybb) showing that the raw data from nws (stored by noaa) says their claim is without merit.

no response. so now i'm getting worried about the statute of limitations as we're getting close to 1 year away from the event.

i called istha and say what's up. they ""can't offer advice."" i forget exactly how i asked but it came up that engineering might want to be cc'd on my next letter as they decide who gets bids.

i start looking around for lawyers. it turns out that i have to file in illinois.  there are some great resources for lawyers in illinois, but when the lawyers hear it's for $1000 in damages, they all say ""no "" - that in good conscience they can't take a case that will cost much more in their time costs than i'd get back in damages. fine. i'll do it myself.

so i look at the illinois small claims court. it allows electronic filing. i know you can lose with incorrect details on the filing, but the state of il provides numbers you can call for people representing themselves in small claims court. i call. i find out:

* you have to file in the district court in which the accident occurred.
* you can ask for court fees when you file.
* don't put anything much on the complaint other than ""the accident occurred at x location at y time, this is in this district in which i'm filing, defendant refuses to pay, therefore i'm filing for damages + court fees + related fees. ""
* the classification you have to put down when filing.
* you can file online and the date of submission is the date when you press ""submit"" (if before 4 pm? i forget the exact time)

i call jco and the conversation with pos goes like this:

me: i want to avoid a lawsuit but i need you to pay for damages and the statute of limitations is coming up.

pos: four other people had this issue - one was a woman who said a tractor trailer hit the sign.

me: what is her name?

pos: don't know but she said she sued the trucking company for $4000.

me: what's the name of the trucking company?

pos: don't know but you should be suing them, not us.

me: how did a truck hit the sign - the sign was behind a concrete barrier?

pos: yeah the truck hit the barrier, bounced off it and damaged the barrier and sign.

me: the dashcam video shows no such evidence. the barriers are all fine and there aren't even skid marks up them. i might have to take you to court.

pos: see you in court! wasn't even our sign - the sign is from a subcontractor (names subcontractor).

me: what's their number?

pos: (gives the number)

so i call the sign subcontractor. dead end. i file the lawsuit against jco, ask for damages + costs to file the lawsuit.  choose just regular certified mail.

* a month or two later and i get a letter from their corporate office (this supposedly local company was actually a subdivision of a much larger company - possibly international) asking to settle and not bring any future claims about this matter in exchange for 100% of what i asked for. i agree.
* call the small claims court and ask about cancelling the lawsuit and the legal advocate there insists ""unthe check clears do not cancel the lawsuit"". ok - i get it, but what's the process? ""unthe check clears do not cancel the lawsuit - people get caught by this all the time!!!"" - uh, ok - i really do understand, but what is the process? can't do it - have to go to trial, but you can tell the judge at that time that you ask for dismissal.
* check clears a few days before the trial.
* call the court and they say that i have to show up but if nobody shows up, the case is dismissed and that this is vey common. i say it would be a long drive and inconvenient for me to get there and i ask if i can just fax in my request to dismiss the case with settlement details. they say yes make it attn: the person i'm  talking to and the judge. i send the fax.
* i call jco to let pos know i'm asking the case to be dismissed ... he's no longer with the company.

tldr; road contracting company is negligent and causes damage to people's vehicles, asshole director gives me the run around, says ""sue me"". i do. they pay. he's gone (fired?).

&#x200b;

p.s. having public resources like gps ,the court system, noaa, is awesome. i couldn't have stood up to a massive company like this without either spending a shitload on lawyer fees or having taxpayer-paid infrastructure like judicial advocates, freely accessible noaa data, and a legal system that puts individual claimants on an equal basis with any dishonest company.  people may complain about paying taxes but a well run government is an indispensable tool for us regular citizens.

p.p.s. always have a dashcam that records gps datetime and location. an $80 investment saved me $1000. the one i have isn't sold anymore and isn't as good as newer ones, so am not identifying it.",2

"by having a conversation with my mom about sex. the fu was yesterday. i made a post on whisper about how i thought it was weird when guys left only their socks on during sex. my location was on when i posted, so people in my home town could see it under local. 

i get a message from the post from another chick, we start talking about it and describing our experiences with dudes getting naked for sex but leaving their socks on, including a funny little sex story about her and her ex husband. 

i come from my bedroom to the living room, where my mom currently is, as i send a message to the chick. that's when i heard the distinct whisper notification sound from her phone like 4 seconds after

at first i thought ""well that's a coincidence"", but in case it wasn't, i asked casually ""ooh who's texting you, cute guy?"" following ""no some lady i are talking about sex"" (my mom is very blunt about these things, but she probably said that to make me leave her alone anyway). 

that's when it hit me for real. oof, just had a conversation about my parents having sex. yea, my dad leaves his socks on... thinking about deleting whisper now.

"as a pakistani living in the west, people who move to live in western countries and hate the west are some of the worst human beings on earth. my parents are from pakistan. i do love the people from pakistan just like how i love the people from england where i reside. i have a strong passion and deep love for both countries. 

however, no matter how hard life gets, i am utterly grateful that i live in a country where i can freely express myself, live in safe and favourable conditions with no fear, have access to good health, and live in a place where there is a roof above me much unlike how my parents grew up when they were young. i have an immense gratitude of england and the rest of europe in general and it pains me and angers me deeply when i see some people passionately hating the west.

although most immigrants i know deeply appreciate their life in the west, there are a few who swear at the west so much, that i would go as far as to say they don't even deserve to live here. in my eyes, they are some of the worst human beings on earth. but even that is the beauty of england. you can criticize it as much as you want and still live here.

every time my life gets hard, i am reminded that i at the very least won't ever be killed or put in jail for expressing a certain view point that others don't like. yes, there is some irrational hatred of immigrants solely based on their skin colour that is growing recently, and that should be condemned since it's racist. but at the same time, most of us should recognize the fact that we are living in a kind of society that is the first of its kind in human history. 

for almost the entirety of human history, there was no such thing as free speech or good health care policies, and thanks to western countries and now thankfully more and more non-western countries, we should be extremely grateful.",6

skip ahead six months or so, and i plug them in again because why not, and i realise there's a volume wheel. i turn it up, working. good as new. and i spent the rest of the day feeling like the biggest idiot.

"update 'i won't move in with my boyfriend because of my cat'. first off, let me say i'm still shaking so if this is a rambled mess i am sorry. all your kind words from yesterday made me cry, thank you all so much. i thought i would give some back story to how my bf and i met. it was through a support group, as i mentioned. growing up, (until age 7) i had a very abusive dad. when i was 7 he tried to kill my mother and i, luckily the cops intervened and they took him away. my mom charged him and he got put away. when the trial was done, we moved, and my mom gave me moomoo (don't judge the name, i was 8), from a local shelter. i didn't fit in at the new school, and moomoo was the best thing in my life. back to the support group.

i shared my story, and my bf confronted me after saying he also had abusive parents growing up, and we bonded over our similar situations. i didn't realize how much control he had over me until recently. he convinced me to stop seeing my therapist, we also stopped going to group. he used to tell me what to wear, how to style my hair (it's very curly, and recently i've been straightening it because he would always say it looked better). 

a few hours ago, i invited him over for lunch and to talk. luckily, moomoo was in my room sleeping. i told him what you guys said, saying that if it was his dog he would be upset. he blew up. he told me that wasn't the point. the point was i wasn't committed to him, or didn't care about us. he started throwing things (a glass, some books i had lying about, and some picture frames). it was terrifying. i had never seen him this angry before, and i just reverted back to what i used to do as a kid. curl up, cover yourself as much as you can, stay quiet. bless my roommate, who came home during this fit. she had brought the security guard because as she was walking in she heard the shouting/items breaking. my bf was escorted out, as he left i just screamed ""don't come back."" i hope it sticks.

i've blocked his number, and my landlady has been notified not to let him in, as have the guards. next step is neighbours. i don't really know what to do from here. i emailed my therapist, hopefully she will let me come back. my mom is on the way over right now, and my roommate is with me too. i'm so terrified. i didn't realize how much control he had over me. i thought all his early behaviours was just because he had clingy issues from his own upbringing. 

i'm going to have a bath, relax, let my hair go curly again, and cuddle my baby. i'm really glad moomoo was in my room.  thank you all for the help. i didn't think any of this was wrong until you guys brought it up. i still love him, and feel bad for him. he had a shit upbringing too, and i'm sure he's messed up from it, but i'm going to try to move on. after my cat dies, i'm going to move out from this place, to somewhere he doesn't know about. thank you all again. 

edit for everyone who wants to see moomoo (copy from another comment):
i don't want to be identified incase anyone i know or in the future know find this- that's why i made a throw away, as i do have a regular reddit account. 
imagine this: pretty big tomcat, mainly white with three huge black spots on his back, leg, and side of his head. minus the back right leg, and yellow eyes. 8 year old me thought he looked like a cow, and cows moo, hence the name 'moomoo'.  he's pretty derpy, but hes mine.

"don't give up on financial fitness even when you hit rock bottom. my fiance left me (she wanted to see other people) with 2k in credit card debt, i had 20k in student loans (she had 37k) and i had moved 300 miles away from my family to be with her (she wanted to be close to her family). i was destroyed beyond belief as you could imagine. as soon as she left me i focalized my pain and anger in a positive way. i decided to apply to 82 different jobs near my family. i got 3 interviews, i nailed them all but out of instinct i followed with one in particular. i ended up getting the job so i could finally move out of the apartment with all of her stuff giving me harsh daily reminders of a failed engagement. my pay raise was jumping from 50k to 80k!! i lived in that depressing hell box alone for 2 months while she lived with her parents. when i moved i started changing my financial life. she wanted loans for our wedding (before she dumped me) which i hated but thought, i mean it is our big day. i dropped that crappy debt ideology she thought was 'okay' and changed my views! here we are now, in 6 months since starting my new job, i have my own apartment, my credit cards are paid off and i am down to 10k on my student loans, with a 2k rainy day fund, 1k in my hsa, and with a maximum 401k contribution. 

advice: my advice for you guys and gals, when you hit rock bottom, remember to bounce hard so you can go higher at a faster speed. focus your negative emotions (anger and sadness) and turn those thoughts and feelings into productivity. you can do this. also, disassociate yourself from those who put you into financial stress, its unhealthy and stressful, you will be amazed at your potential when you surround yourself with people who root for financial freedom.",10

thanks to everyone for the advice, quite a bit has happened since my first post.

i ignored him and continued doing what i was doing, then a few days after i posted he showed up at the bar while i wasn't there and asked around for me. they said he seemed drunk (which is unfortunate as he allegedly got sober after our breakup) and they told him to fuck off and called me to warn me. 

before i could even react to that, he contacted several people at my work via social media, including one person very high up in upper management who barely knows who i am. he sent them all the same opener, saying he was trying to reach out to me and asked for my phone number or email and saying it was urgent. two of my colleagues responded to this message that i know of, both said something to the effect that they wouldn't be able to share my info but they'd let me know he asked. he then began threatening them and ""warning"" them about me and telling them very sexually explicit things about me and asking if they were sure i was the type of person they wanted to work with. 

i was really, really trying to avoid asking anyone at work for help even though i knew they would be nice about it. i didn't want to be the person that drags their drama into the office, but my ex did it for me, so i decided it couldn't hurt at this point to consult with a friendly coworker in legal to see what she thinks. she walked me through getting a restraining order and put me in touch with an attorney that practices in this arena if i end up needing it - i really hope not to.

literally two days after the tro was granted and he had been served, he showed up at the bar again, drunk again, and this time i was there. it was honestly really surreal seeing him. they kicked him out but he loitered outside and refused to leave and the bartender and my friends and some random strangers were all guarding the door, it was quite the debacle, we called the cops and he was arrested.

so, i think i'm in the clear for now, although i know he's willing to break the law so i'm not incredibly comfortable. i put up cameras in my apartment, my friends are walking me out to the car every night (i used to walk alone, it's a safe enough area it was never a concern before), my employer and colleagues are aware and supportive even though i wish i could've kept this private. i'm doing what i can. there wasn't a huge dramatic ending to all of this but it seems like it should be over now - here's hoping. thank you again for the advice and support everyone!",2
"i hate being a mom. i don't know where to start. but i'm hoping someone else on here can at least understand what i'm feeling without judging me or telling me things like ""you don't know how lucky you are; a lot of people can't even have kids!"" i know. and although i should be completely over the moon about my awesome kid, i'm just...not. 

it started with the pregnancy. the second i found out i was pregnant, i had a strange feeling. not the one of excitement or a bit scared, but that i didn't want it. deep in my gut, i knew i made a terrible decision to get pregnant. my husband and i agreed to try, though i was still on the fence. i also didn't think i could get pregnant because i had horrible problems with ovarian cysts my whole life and doctors told me i wouldn't be able to get pregnant past 30 (there were other reasons too but i won't get into them). i was 34, so i figured, what the hell, we'll try (he really really wanted kids), and when i can't have them at least we'll say we tried. well, turns out it only took one try. one. i know. most people would consider that so incredibly lucky, and trust me i am well aware of the people out there who struggle with infertility. 

as the weeks went on i struggled with absolutely terrible morning sickness until about week 22. that's a long time, especially how sick i was. around week 22/23 i started to feel a little better, especially because i knew i was more than halfway done with that hellish experience. at week 28 i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and was back and forth to doctors every five seconds. i felt like a science experiment. 

i was induced at 41 weeks and only pushed for 12 minutes. he came out in 5 pushes. again, i know. luckiest person on the planet especially because i had an epidural that worked like a charm. but the second i held him i didn't want him. i wanted to give him back. i felt no emotional connection. nothing. and then i hemorrhaged. and then i developed eclampsia, which is high blood pressure after birth. it was the most hellish three days of my life, thinking i was going to have a seizure or stroke and possibly die. finally when i got released from the hospital on a myriad of medications, i didn't want to be there at all. it wasn't the same home.

it wasn't the home of cooking all-day meals, spontaneous trips to the wineries, sitting and reading a book for hours. i didn't realize i actually cared about any of these things until they were gone. and that gut feeling of not wanting  a baby only got worse. 

in the next weeks and months i struggled with what was eventually diagnosed with postpartum depression and postpartum ptsd. it was absolutely terrible and i contemplated suicide many times. the lack of sleep paired with those things made me feel like a complete lunatic. my marriage suffered, and i believe my husband and i will never be the same because of what occurred in those months with my emotions.

fast forward to today. my husband does so much to help me. he's there every second i need him and works right down the road, so he can be home in a second if i truly need something. my parents watch my son one day and my in-laws another day. but it's not enough. i don't want to be around him. i'm bored to tears playing toddler games and even going to the playground and stuff with him. i'm looking at my watch every five seconds. 

part of the problem is that i work from home. i was very, very talented and successful in my office job, which eventually converted to a work-at-home position. so by default, i became a stay-at-home mom. let me make one thing clear: i never ever ever wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. i made this very clear from the beginning, and i absolutely said i would never do it. i'm not cut out for it. and here i am. sitting home with him, day after day. we do tons of things. he takes gym classes, art classes, we play outside all the time, go on outings, go to the food store. he's clean and well-fed and loved and always entertained and happy. he really is a great kid. 

but i hate this. like with every fiber of my being. hate it. the sleep transitions, the teething, the not wanting to eat the food i make, the tantrums, everything. like literally everything you can think about having a kid, i hate it. and the noise. omg the noise. the tantrums, the kid songs that make you go insane.... i just can't anymore. 

i feel like being a mom brings out all of my worst personality traits. i didn't even know i was impatient, but apparently i am! i get so frustrated with him so quickly, and i have silent little anxiety attacks while i discipline him or deal with whatever is going on. 

i just am so surprised - and weighed down - by the responsibility. i am one of the most responsible people on the planet. always early to things, always organized, always on top of stuff. i have a dog, who i got as a puppy and i take a lot of pride in training her and being her dog mom. i have nieces who i take care of from time to time and i take what i say and do around them very seriously. and my job is extremely integrated with other people and working with teams. i am a director, so a lot of people rely on me. but shit. this is too much. being responsible for a little human being, and every single thing i say is going to affect them in some way??? no thank you. it is a weight that is suffocating me every second of the day. and i wasn't expecting that. on paper, i should actually be a great mom. but i'm really not.

and i don't know what to do. i went to therapy, was on medication, everything. but i feel like the only thing that would truly make me happy would be to go back to work full-time in an office job. right now i piece together my work. when he's napping - if he naps - at night, early in the morning. i can never concentrate and what was once a bright and lucrative career now leaves me stressed out and awake at 3 a.m. wondering how i'm going to get my work done. i can't concentrate and its like he needs something every other second. i keep waiting to like it. i keep waiting to feel something. but i don't. 

and don't get me wrong. when he hurts himself or cries from being sad, my heart breaks. when my parents pull away with him in the car and i see his little face in the back seat i miss him. but then...he gets back and i'm like...when can he go over their house again???? it is truly the strangest feeling. i'm confused. and if anything ever, ever happened to him i don't know what i do. he is a sweet, gentle, loving, kooky kid. always laughing and smiling, and i make sure to give him tons of hugs and kisses every single day and tell him i love him. i don't ever want him to know these things i'm saying here. 

thank you for listening, whoever is out there. i pray you will not judge me. my husband is absolutely wonderful, but he hates when i try to talk about this kind of thing. we've always been very open about all of our feelings and issues, but he gets so angry when i try to tell him that i really truly don't like this. he doesn't believe me and says ""you make yourself not like it."" i'm not sure what to think about that. but alas.

"update on contacting the child i gave up for adoption 12 years ago. a new update to this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bpqws6/i_was_separated_from_my_child_12_years_ago_if/) and this first update(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c5gn9y/update_to_my_post_about_contacting_the_child_i/) as some people asked (i hope this is ok and i'm not breaking the sub's rules). thanks again to the people at r/legaladvice.

i wrote a letter to my ex-wife. i spare you the detail but in it i apologized for what i've done and took responsibility for it. i also told her that i've made efforts to better myself and how i got my act together, and that i'm aware that she only has my word as proof for it and i know that's not much. i asked if she would let me know how she and my son were doing and if she'd be willing to share a bit about his life. i asked if he knows about me and if she thinks there's a chance she would let me contact him at some point in the future. i also added that i won't make any further attempt at contact if she doesn't answer or if she asks me to stop.

i really wasn't sure she would answer but she did. it was a long and emotional letter. i don't want to say too much but she says she has forgiven me and she's glad i'm doing better. she, my son and her husband are doing well. my son is a happy young man, he's doing great in school and has a nice group of friends. she finds him very mature for his age, he knows what he wants to do with his future. he has a good relationship with his parents and siblings. reading this has been a huge relief, i'm so glad he's doing well. she said i was right to give him up for adoption however difficult it may have been. i knew it but reading it from my ex-wife has been incredibly comforting.

my son knows he's adopted, and he knows why his mom left with him and why he's never met me. apart from that he doesn't know much about me. he has asked a few questions over the years and his mother has answered truthfully, and she writes that she hasn't bad mouthed me and i believe her. as for contacting him in the future, she'll think about it, but she and her husband need to talk about it first and see if my son wants it. and obviously my ex-wife and her husband will need to talk to me to see if i've changed for real. she said that she needs time to think about it and she doesn't want to rush things, but whatever they decide in the end she won't keep me in the dark.

so now all i've got to do is wait. this is a positive outcome, knowing my son is doing great is what i had been hoping for all these years and it helps a lot, even more than i would have expected. even if i'm not sure if there will be contact in the future, there's hope so that's fine.",2

"beware ""new"" debt consolidation companies. i just received ""debt consolidation"" offers from crisp funds and whistler funding. i found it odd they were essentially identical, seemed to offer too good to be true rates and had no reg z disclosures.

in the little bit of research i've done i've found that the same ""company"" is doing business under numerous names all run by the semi-infamous mec distribution...

their previous ""businesses"" include:

guardian angel funding

graphite funding

salvation funding

doublestar financial

broadstar financial

bridgeline funding

pebblestone financial

lafayette funding

crestmont funding

guardian angel funding

sovereign funding

it appears that since they caught so much heat under these names they have recently opened new ""businesses""...i have found at least 3 new ones:

crisp funds
whistler funding
stonedale partners

identical mailers, nearly identical websites, all 3 sites anonymously registered on 10/25/18. god knows how many other names they're functioning under. they're also using virtual addresses for all of their ""businesses""...

their disclosures state they are a marketing firm that simply tries to connect you to an outside lender and make a referral bonus but people who have spoken to them are told ""they couldn't find a match for you"" and they recommend their scammy debt settlement program. 

perhaps worst of all, they're run under a rent-a-tribe scam so that they are protected against lawsuits by sovereign immunity afforded to native american tribes by operating as a ""tribal-run"" business. so you wouldn't have any recourse for when they inevitably scam you. (this is also how they get away with not having the legally required reg z disclosures on their offers)

beware!!!

edited to update mec funding to the name found on bbb, etc. (mec distribution) so folks can see some of the prior issues

update 2: more ""businesses"" found that are this same group:

chevron funding  
patriot funding  
glider lending  
tweed funding / tweed lending  
concourse lending  
piper funding  
stallion lending  
bicostal funding

"by letting our dog hang out while we did the dirty.  so  my girlfriend has been working early mornings all week due to some  staff shortages, and even though we've been feeling frisky all week, we  haven't had the time. so, when friday night rolls around, we're raring  to go.

usually, our dog hates being near  us when we're rolling in the sheets (literally) because there's nowhere  for her to lie on the bed. so, her thing is that she curls up in her  doggie bed and waits for it all to blow over before coming back onto the  bed for cuddles.

sparing everyone the  details, the foreplay's pretty good. unfortunately, it's a little too  good, as for some reason our dog starts getting concerned and maybe  thinks that our sounds are distress calls or something. she hops on the  bed and starts licking my gf's face. it's cute, until she decides to  start to lick mine.

in a fit of ""oh no i  can't let her lick my lips because then i can't kiss my girlfriend  anymore"" madness, i reflexively back away... and knee my girlfriend's,  uh, nether regions in the process.

she  rolls over in pain, but she's cry laughing, and both of us just are lost  at how absurd this has been. meanwhile, our dog, oblivious to it all,  is having the time of her life as my girlfriend is dying of pain and i try my best to comfort her.

needless to say, i didn't get any last night. will try again tonight, but i'll keep the dog in her crate as a precaution.

tl;dr:  our sex scared the dog, the dog scared me, i kneed my girlfriend in the  verguba, ruined the moment, and didn't get laid :(",4

"my mom might be brain dead.. this post will be scattered, and absolutely deleted when i wake up.

monday, december 17, 2018, at around 3:40ish p.m, i had just grabbed my work clothes, and peered into my mom's room, to find her having a heart attack, or stroke, or.. something. doctors still aren't sure.

today, monday, december 24th, 2018, she is still not awake. she is diabetic. her kidneys aren't functional. she's on continuous dialysis. if she makes it through this, she absolutely will lose one or both feet. her lungs aren't working properly. today, she is supposed to have a test done to see if there is any brain activity. 
and, our landlord texted us. we are extremely late on rent. he is preparing eviction papers.
these last 7 days have felt.. unreal. like i'm in a dream, or an episode of a lame tv show.

it was so sudden. my mom hasn't been feeling well the last few months, but no matter how much i talked with her, how much i yelled, she would not go to the hospital.

i'm breaking. the last few months we have not gotten along at all. i said such horrible things to her. i want more than anything to go back to even last monday, and tell her i love her more than anything, and beg her to go to the hospital. i'm only 27. she is only 51. she is too young.

i can't lose my mom. i can't lose my mom. i've been having nightmares, i keep seeing her terrifying face, as she's gasping, gripping her chest, eyes staring to the right. i keep seeing her huge, bulging eyes with a vacant stare in the e.r. after they somewhat stabilized her. a machine breathing for her. hooked to so many tubes.

as absolutely pathetic as this is, i just want her to hold me and tell me everything is going to be okay. my mom is far from perfect, she is only human... but i will always and forever love her.

i want my mom. 

... thank you for reading. i needed to type this out.

happy holidays.

update: thank you to those who have read this, and have commented. an update.. the test shows there is damage. doctors don't know to what extent. if nothing changes by the weekend, we will have a very, very difficult decision to make. but it would honor her wishes. i don't know if i believe in god, or any afterlife, but i hope there is some sort of peace for my mother.
thank you.

update 2:  i can never express how grateful i am, and how loved i feel to you all who have read and commented on this. thank you. my heart and thoughts go out to each and every one of you. 
just... thank you. each and every one of your comments comforted me, and renewed a bit of hope and faith. honestly so many of the comments made me cry, overwhelmed from all the support and well wishes, as well as the ones with similar experiences. i promise you all, i am doing my  best staying strong. i have been breaking down the last couple days, since it's begun to sink in, but i know i will.. be okay.  i hope whoever you are, wherever you are reading this, you have a great day, even if you don't celebrate the current holidays!

edit: i want everyone to know i read every. single. comment. i am so grateful to each and every one of you offering your prayers. i can't wait to tell my mom how many people are thinking of her and praying for her! i also do plan on taking the advice to read this post to her. i know i keep repeating myself, but.. thank you. thank you for all the support.",11

"i chucked poo at a jerky dog owners car after he wouldn't pick up after his dog. my apartment is located in a brand new, clean and nicely maintained building close the the city centre,

for the most part, my existence goes mostly unnoticed. the elevators are quiet and i rarely bump into anyone except the odd dog owner out for a late afternoon walk with their puppy. im a great tenant, and i also really hate confrontation or getting into any kind of dispute with neighbours so i try to keep to myself and not irritate those around me. 

i first met the asshole with the white dog on my way up to my floor during a weekend. he was one of those really beefy dudes with who's seen too much sun. his hair looked like it had been dipped in bacon grease and his cologne, i dunno, it smelled ""spicy""... my nose was burning by the time he got off the floor, it was like standing next to a real life ronnie from jersey shore except his skin was really bad and he was probably at least 40. my first interaction with this dude was nothing major, however, the next time i saw him in the elevator was last month and he had the little white dog with him. the doors opened and him and some other tenant were in a heated confrontation about not picking up his dogs crap from outside the front doors. he was being super belligerent to her, spat on the floor close to her feet and called her a c\*\*\*. i was horrified. the woman was shaking angry and almost in tears after he got off on his floor. she awkwardly turned to me during the ride up and apologized, saying that the guy always takes his dog out for walks but just lets it shit anywhere and it got smeared all over the floor when a delivery guy came in with a dolly. i told her it was brave of her to approach him about it as i frankly would never bother with such an aggressive personality. 

slowly as the week went on, i came to find out that other tenants had issues with this guy. namely one guy who ended up getting into a physical altercation with him over parking. too add to his general jerkiness, he always parked in the private visitor parking on the side of our building (which is off limits for tenants) because he was too cheap to pay for underground. 

2 weeks ago i ended up in the elevator with him, it was rainy outside so i had the hood up on my yellow jacket and the drawstrings were pulled nice and tight for my afternoon run. he had his dog on a leash, clearly about to take her out for a walk and his music was going tsktsktsk. as we got off on the main floor, he continued to pay me pretty much zero notice.  

i paused in the lobby to tuck my running tights over my socks... and proceeded to witness as his dog popped a squat, and left a long warm poo in the centre of the lobby floor. i looked up at the guy as if to say ""wtf!?"" but he just scrolled through his phone, glanced over at his dog, and mindlessly and tugged on the leash. i stood there in a moment of shock, thinking to myself 

""wow... this dude really does have no sense of decency"".

i really didn't want anyone to step in it, but i didn't want to pick it up either. i stood there for a moment debating what to do. i could see him out the window, walking up the street and pulling his hood up... and then the water cooler caught my eye. i grabbed a cup and scooped as much of the poo up that i could... gagging a bit because, who the f\*\*\* wants to pick up shit in a styrofoam cup. without thinking i went outside and whipped it out of the cup and onto his windsheild. it landed, unsuccessfully, in the corner dip of his windshield close to the wing mirror. i stood there mildly disappointed with my vengeful act, but at least it wasn't on the floor anymore.

 i tossed the cup in the bin and continue on with my run as per usual.

it continued to rain most of the evening and at around 7pm i decided to pop down to the convenience store across the street and get some chips. as i was walking back, the asshole was coming out of the apartment doors, running towards his car with his gym bag in hand.

suddenly my heart raced.

i couldn't just stop where i was, paranoid he'd notice my weird behaviour... so i kept walking towards the building. he started his car and immediately the auto windshield wipers went on, and i had a front row seat to witness a massive long, wet, smear of dog shit just spread evenly across the glass. at that point i panicked and headed towards the back doors to get in the building, my heart thumping hard in my chest. but i heard him scream 

""what the actual fuck"" 

after i got in my apartment i suddenly realized he was probably going to go to management and ask them to check security tapes. i spent 3 days worrying and dodging the elevators in my place like a terrified idiot. every time someone walked past my door i thought ""oh god, its him, he found out it was me"". 

finally, last monday, a notice went up with my picture, all 5'3 of me, hood up, chucking a piece of poo onto this guys truck with the caption ""do you know who this is? - management""

oh god.

what have i done.

i knew the end was near, and for 3 more days i waited for my inevitable demise once he found out who i was. 

i never heard a peep from anyone, nothing from management. i was completely convinced i'd be found out because my building has cameras everywhere. now the notices are gone, and i was in the elevator with the guy, and he's never given me so much as a nod.

but i can never wear that yellow rain jacket, ever again.",12
"by getting the bomb squad called to my local park and getting a statewide manhunt put into place.. before you read. i. know. it. was. dumb. thats. why. im. here. enjoy the godamn story ""karen"" is in the comments if you want both sides of the story.

nvmd they left

so. this all started yesterday, i had left work early because i felt like shit and didnt want to work with a cold. i didnt know what to do with all this free time i've just been granted so i figured,""hey let's make a rocket."" i've seen the king of randoms video on how to make a rocket engine out of pvc pipe and household ingredients so i thought i'd give it a go. i picked up all the stuff i needed and made my way to the park(wide, open, and well ventilated area).

 first mistake, i was supposed to use 3/4 pvc. i used an inch and a half. second mistake, karen was sitting in the corner of the park hidden from view.(you'll see how she plays into this)

 so my buddy and i spend about an hour or so constructing this failed abortion of a rocket, adding much more fuel than necessary and packing too tight. the time comes where this bad boys ready to fly and we start taking precautions; we alerted everyone in the area, and even gathered a small crowd to watch the rocket.

 however, we completely missed karen as she was fucking hiding in her car on the far end. so we light the godamn thing and instead of launching it just smokes. like a lot. like so fucking much it looked like there was a forest fire, i cant put into words how much smoke this foot long ""rocket"" was producing. we soon realized it's a dud and we leave it be so it will run out of fuel. just our luck a group of track kids come out of the woods to run laps( on the track the rocket is chilling on) and they just stop and stare, clearly concerned. we realized our mistake and attempted to put it out except it just wouldn't. fucking. stop. eventually a kid from our crowd yeeted it into a nearby field and it eventually died down. we attempted to clean up the mess but nothing was cooperating. the rocket had eaten a hole into the pavement and there was molten plastic everywhere. we picked up what we could and left hoping that would be the end of it.(it was apprently fucking not) 
so my buddy and i are sitting in mcdonalds talking over the situation when a large black police unit drove by. not too suspicion but they're not common to our area, and this had plating all around it. we joked about it being a bomb squad and eventually forgot about it. fast forward to the next morning i get a call from my brother claiming someone planted a pipebomb at our park. they had pictures of our cars and had a statewide search in place. apparently karen had to get her titties in a bunch and made a post on facebook about the ordeal, claiming ""two men were seen planting a incendiary device at the local park"" 

asap, i hauled ass down to the local police station to clear things up. fhey called up the bomb squad to check to see if it looked more like a bomb or a rocket and we took the time to go over my abominations. they were very understanding, and eventually got everything cooled down. all that came from it was a ticket for disturbance of the peace and a warning to not make godamn rockets in public parks. i'm terrible at retelling things so let me know if my storytelling needs work .

tl;dr i made a really shitty rocket and karen called a bomb squad.

edit: pic on my profile of the failed rocket
edit: a word

info:, i know it was stupid, that's why i'm here. i've been depressed as fuck and i make stupid shit as an attempt at a hobby and to distract myself. even the cops were pissed at ""karen"" for blowing the whole thing out of proportion. 

just take it as a funny story for the love of everything.

"for brushing out the curls on my biracial daughter?. edited to add- to the people out there with curly hair, i hear you and i understand! however, my daughter is 4. my husband and i both have worked hard to figure out how to care for her hair. he does play an active role in coming up with what she needs and i execute it. if i was willing to fight her tooth and nail every morning, i could style it into pretty curls, sure. but it is not worth it to me or my husband to do that to her because she hates it so much and we are not willing to override her bodily  autonomy just to make her hair look nice. it's just hair. what i'm doing is just getting the over-night matted rat's nest out. she does not have course hair. it is fine and smooth like mine and it because a matted mess just like mine, it can't be braided or put in a protective style, unfortunately. that will just rip her hair out. not that she would tolerate that, anyway. she removes anything or any style i've ever tried to do in her hair. even if she cooperates while i'm doing it, 5 minutes later, she'll just pull out whatever i put in. from french braids to hair clips and headbands. they're all a no-go.
my husband and i have put a lot of time and effort into finding out exactly how to best care for her hair, and this is really it for now. it's not the best for her hair but it is the best for her well being, as we've decided as her parents. we'll revisit her hair care when she's older, i promise. and i would never use heat treatments on a child. i don't care if it curls or not. we just want her to look half groomed.


--------------------------------
so i am white my husband is black and we have two daughters, ages 2 and 4. my 4 year old looks a lot like her (very handsome, if i might add) daddy. but she's got my texture hair with a massive amounts of curls that i usually am the one to take care of. yesterday i brushed her hair in to a ponytail and put her in an old, very dated (but cute for the time!) outfit from when i was a kid in the 90's and recreated a photo of me when i was her age. i thought it was adorable but i received a lot of backlash from my ""woke"" friends and family (on my side, for the record. i'm not close to his family and they all just ""heart"" any pictures of my kids and rarely comment, if they do just to say they like the picture) accusing me of trying to make her ""white"". 

i've had underhanded comments before from them about ""erasing my kid's identity"" for brushing her hair? she's a child. to maintain her curls to look good requires quite a bit of time and products. often she just lets me brush the rat's nest out of it and calls it a day. any time i style it, she sticks her hands in it and messes it up. what else can i do? however, doing this does brush the curls out until her hair gets wet again. she hates having her hair misted or dampeded and it's too cold for that now anyway. my husband doesn't care. he's happy she's clean and fed. 

to wrap this up, i've had more than one person say i need to leave my more ""black-passing"" child's image alone and let her embrace being black, especially because, get this, my 2 year old is more ""white-passing"" with wavy light hair and my blue eyes. including what i feel is dangerous advice to let her play outside without sunscreen. we have no idea what her sun tolerance is and i'm not about to deal with a small child having a sunburn i gave her on purpose. i have a low sun tolerance and don't tan, just burn like a boiled lobster. 

i'm going to be honest, this all blows my mind a little bit. my husband has never said anything of the sort. i've asked him about it and he said i don't need to worry about it. i don't let these people anywhere near my kids in person and some of them i can't avoid or just cut off. so am i being an asshole?",3
"no regrets nsfw i told my gf that i really like futanari and hentai. my gf and i have lived together for almost a year now and she is amazing. we play video games together, watch anime and have very similar interests. it's almost like she is me but in girl form. one day we got on the topic of things we've never told anyone and i decided that if i was going to be with someone they should love me for everything i'm interested in... including futanari (hentai chicks with dicks) and just hentai in general. so, i told her that those things really turned me on. i wasn't worried about her reaction because for some reason i knew she was either going to think i was disgusting or be totally fine with it. it actually felt like a big weight off my shoulders.

so i tell her, she looks at me a with wide eyes at first then looks down and starts twiddling her thumbs. i immediately think ""well, looks like things will be awkward for a while."" when she mumbled something that i couldn't really hear. i asked her what she said and she replies
""i've actually always wanted to have a dick and i love hentai... i subscribe to ton of boards on reddit. i even really like traps...""

i was so stunned she said that. it hit me like a mack truck. so we got to talking about it more then ended up browsing reddit together all night and sharing our hentai collections. turns out we are more alike than i even thought. we'd each be scrolling through going ""ooo i love this one! i have it saved already."" then we ended up turning on hentai haven and watching our favorite hentai episodes together while having sex a few times. 

honestly, i don't care what this makes me. gay, bi, straight with weird fantasies. all i know is i was completely myself around her and received nothing but acceptance and now an even larger amount of understanding. we also already had sex a very healthy amount, but now it's even more so. it's really common place for us to be gaming on our pcs together while casually browsing reddit and sharing hentai. i honestly have the best gf in the world.",12
"my parents want to put their house in my name so they can take out on a loan on it. is there any risk to this?. i'm 20 years old and have fair credit and don't live with my parents. they have terrible credit but live in a house they own worth 140,000 dollars. they are completely broke right now because they make awful financial decisions. 

i'm not smart enough to know what to do about this or if there's a big risk, but my mom asked me today if they could put the house in my name and i could take out a loan on it. she said she would pay the monthly payments out of the loan. is there any safe way to go about this? she said it's not risky at all, but i assume the fear would be that she wouldn't pay the monthly payments and i would end up getting my credit screwed up and owing money. 

however, she said i would get 5,000 dollars out of it and that money would really help me moving into my own place.",10

we don't know the gender yet but my husband prefers names that most people would call black names for boys. names like trayvon, devonte, marquis, etc. 

i grew up with a name that is tied to black culture and hated it for most of my life. i go by a shortened form of my name professionally (i.e dee for denaisha) because i have seen how people react to my government name. i am sure i have been passed up for jobs because of how people perceive my name. 

my husband has a name more commonly used for white boys (i.e jake). he wants a strong black name for our son because he never had that and believes that giving him a ""white"" name to avoid racism isn't helping anyone. i don't disagree but don't want to use our son as a test dummy to change that.

the past few days however, i made a huge change in my diet. i started eating **real** food (psa microgreens are amazing, my new favorite thing). also, this morning i put coconut oil in my coffee instead of creamer. those two changes led me to the most glorious poop i've ever taken. i have no idea how that came out of me. i'm at work and was nervous that it wasn't even going to flush. there was like 6 straight up logs that came out effortlessly in under a minute. it was a beast!

last month i got an x-ray done on my spine, which you can see my intestines on, and the doctor put a note in about ""excessive amounts of stool impacted in the colon"" (basically i was super constipated). i'm pretty sure that just resolved itself.

"by bringing my sunscreen on a disneyland ride. (actually two weekends ago.)

couple days later i'm at disneyland with my sunscreen attached. when i got onto the thunder mountain ride, i didn't realize the sunscreen bottle was being squeezed between my leg and the safety bar until after it was over and it basically looked like i enjoyed the ride way too much. all over my crotch and the seat.

i didn't have the integrity to make eye contact with any of the employees or check if the people behind me got into the ride. i just booked it out of there and even after washing off my shorts i had a massive grease stain on my crotch all day.

"my fiance (24m) cheated on me (f23) 2 months before we were supposed to get married.. a lot of people advised me not to get married this young but i didn't listen to them. i told them how we were in it for the long haul and us getting married is just a way to secure our relationship and make it stronger. 

i've been with this guy for 5 years now. ever since i was 18. our relationship had its ups and downs but was fairly strong. we didn't fight that much and usually resolved our problems before going to bed. 

he popped the question 8 months ago in our anniversary and i was so ecstatic that i immediately called my friends and family. i was confused as to why my father wasn't as happy as i expected him to be about this news. i later learned that he didn't think i should get married yet and that i should maybe wait a little longer. 

i was so in love with this man that i didn't listen to my dad's advice. i later announced that i'd get married this upcoming march.  

everything went ok and me and my so were really happy about everything. we were going to move into a bigger place and he even got promoted . we didn't have any problems whatsoever.  he was affectionate and didn't act different or cold towards me. 

until one day he got home later than usual because he went to a work party. i didn't really think much of it.  i thought that he deserved a break since he was working a lot lately. 

the next day, he acted very strangely. even when i simply hugged him, he didn't hug me back. i, again didn't think anything of it and just thought that he might be stressed out because of work ( stupid i know ). 

he usually uses my laptop because he broke his own. so when i found his facebook page open, i don't know what made me want to snoop around even though usually i don't. 

i found very explicit messages between him and this girl that he works with. i kept scrolling to a month ago and saw how they were meeting when i wasn't home  and  were having sex. i even saw a selfie with the girl and him in bed. to say i was heart broken was an understatement. all those late nights that he spent ""working"" , he was apparently with her.

the sad thing about this whole situation is that we were getting married after two months. he could've at least told me that this didn't work for him anymore instead of letting me plan our wedding while also working and having to go on work trips often. 

i was sleeping 3h a day so i can juggle all of that while also trying to maintain a social life.

i confronted him and after a yelling match, he confessed that he's been with her for 3 months.  3 freaking months. while i was working my ass off and being freaking sleep deprived. 

i told him that i couldn't continue my life with a cheater. and he cried and told me that it wasn't serious and that he loved me. 

i left the house because i knew that i was so weak that i would probably take him back because i truly love him.  4 days later and i am currently at my dad's house. he still calls and texts me daily and i ignored all of them because i know that i'm currently very emotional and that he could take advantage of that. 

what i hate the most is the mask that i have to put on whenever i go to work. the fake smiles. 

i don't know what to do. no one knows about this except for my dad and my best friends. what i hate the most is having to tell everyone that the wedding is off. i can't even think about that.

my life is so intertwined with this guy. i don't know how to get over him or over the fact that my  wedding dress is sitting in my closet and i'll never get to wear it. 5 years gone to waste. really great. 

i know at this point, my wedding is probably off. but it's so hard for me to understand that. i've been working hard to make this happen. yesterday i slept for 12h for the first time in so long just because i was so angry.  

i am sorry for the long post. i am just trying to vent and this is the only way i can do it. 

tl;dr  my fiance cheated on me two months before our wedding and i am devastated.",7
"by eating a $6,300 piece of dove chocolate. two weeks ago, i was accepted into a research study for healthy individuals to monitor the affects of a drug on their system and how long it lasts in the body.  i prepared for weeks, making sure i followed all the rules in advance.  it required 6 stays of 4 days onsite, and the restrictions were pretty lengthy - but it paid $6,300.
in the restrictions, it stated to avoid excessive amounts of a specific chemical found in chocolate and coffee, within 48 hours of the first dose.

my first dose was on a tuesday, and sunday morning, on my flight home from a work conference, i had a single piece of dove chocolate at 10am central time.  not excessive, right?  wrong.
apparently they meant - no chocolate or coffee.

as i was sitting in the research center, getting ready to settle in for a few days, they asked the question about chocolate.  i told them the truth.  the assistant left to check with the director, and came back saying it was 47hrs from the time of my dose, so i was disqualified.  i gaped at him, and said ""wait! that was 10am ct, we are in mountain time, so it's actually 48 hours!""  he left to tell his director, and they both came back.  i was still disqualified.  apparently, the last dose was possible at 8:55am.  i missed the cutoff by 5 minutes.  they wouldn't budge, and i was sent packing.

$6,300.... gone. like that.  it still hurts.  enough so, that it has taken me two weeks to write this.
at least it was dove, and tasted good.  and the funny part? the inside of the wrapper said ""you can do anything, but you can't do everything."" - shirley k maryland

edit: as i keep getting asked: this one was http://prastudies.com but search your area for paid studies, as they only have 4 locations

edit 2 for clarification answers: 

sorry, i walked away for a couple of hours and this blew up. i'm trying to answer what i can.  but the common themes:

1) i'm a woman. (no that has no bearing on my post, but it was mentioned often in the comments, so i'm clearing it up)

2) i know, i could have lied... but i kind of have a thing about lying.  especially working in the medical industry as long as i did.  lying in medicine is a major no-no.  there is a lot more than money at stake.
also, i actually thought i was in the clear.  i figured the test drug was going to be a night time pill, not a first thing in the morning pill. not to mention, excessive to me isn't a small bite of chocolate.

3) i don't work for dove, or the study group. i'm a project manager. this is truly just me screwing up.  and yes - i own my mistake. 

4) i won't be taking legal action because i truly don't believe there is any to be had.  i ate the chocolate. that's on me.  just because i don't agree with the language to which i was told to avoid it, doesn't mean i didn't still make the mistake.  also - $6,300..although a lot of quick cash, is not a lot for litigation. no point.  i'd lose more than i'd gain. this way i'm also able to continue applying for other studies going forward.  they have new ones every week.

5) they were very clear about how compensation works, and i didn't reach the point of compensation.  

6) this is not about eating dove soap. which would have been really funny i think.  a few people mentioned this is called galaxy chocolate across the pond.

tl;dr - i ate a piece of dove chocolate 5 minutes too late, and it cost me $6,300 because it was a restricted food in a research study i had joined.

"remorse i stopped caring for my parents when i saw their will. my parents are in their 80s and probably won't live for another year or so. i have really stepped in to take care of them by making sure they have groceries, their bills are paid, their doctors know what's going on, getting their meds, having their house taken care of, etc. this has been at a cost to my career and personal life. my other siblings won't lift a finger and say they don't have time because they have kids but it's because they know i am doing it.

i got a hold of my parent's will and was outraged. they are leaving 100% to my two siblings who don't do shit for them. their justification? my two siblings have kids and i don't. i am actually losing money by taking care of my parents and what they are leaving me behind will not make up for that. and i don't make a lot of money but my married siblings are both married to rich men. my sisters don't even have jobs.

i feel like i was taken for granted and let my parents know how i feel. they won't change their will. they say it's because of their grandkids and if they did change the will then my siblings would not bring their grandkids around. my siblings argue that because i am a single woman, then i should be the caretaker by default.

he caught me when i was walking to my car after work and asked for my opinion on floral arrangements. i, being an idiot, gave my opinion and didn't connect the dots until he said ""do you have flowers for your wedding?"". when i protested he said ""i've already ordered them, i'll send them to your house the day before the wedding. this is my wedding gift to you."" he said something else about how it's important to him that i start my marriage off on the right foot and he walked away.

"side gigs are great, but remember not to let them take over your life. since 2013, i have been working over 60 hours a week in one way or another. twice because i had very demanding jobs, and all the others because i was working side gigs. i've worked nights in a restaurant, freelance written after work, and worked in promotional events on weeknights and weekends.

from a financial standpoint, it was a fantastic boost for my goals. i was always making $15/hr or less, and usually in temp jobs. i needed more security. (as of march, i have a new permanent job that pays $20/hr. remember this, it's important later.)

i paid off my student loans in 7 months, got out of $4,000 in credit card debt, saved $10,000, and was able to move into my own apartment where i live alone.

i finally settled into my place about a month ago, and i've had a lot of time to think. i was looking at my budget thinking and wondering what the next ""thing"" was. use side money to begin contributions to an ira? get enough money saved for a down payment on a car when mine kicks the bucket? extra money for a vacation? but nothing was immediate. that was frustrating, so i had to think more about what the side gigs could help me with. 

during this time, i also started thinking about a lot of opportunities i missed because of my side gigs. i had to decline friends' invitations to hang out, visiting my family, and taking up hobbies. i also did not focus as much on things outside of my main job that could have improved my main income, like networking and doing a little outside research.

i realized something: i was becoming a robot. i was not truly involved in the things i was doing - just going through the motions to get the money i needed. i felt empty knowing there was nothing left financially to achieve... and that made me feel kind of pathetic. my life had revolved around making money. i didn't even know what was going on in my friends' lives, and i couldn't answer ""what do you like to do in your free time?"" outside of making money and pushing myself to meet goals. 

on top of that, there was no longer a need to be a robot. i made enough now to live comfortably and save way more than $200 per month. i'll be eligible for the 401k next year. we get yearly col raises and bonuses. there was no reason to continue busting my ass when i had enough now to live in my means, and a little more, and i was in a healthy financial place. 

so two weeks ago, i decided to stop all forms of outside money-making. the only thing i will continue to do is one summer gig that doesn't pay well, but genuinely makes me happy and doesn't eat too much of my time. things are already changing for the better. i've had more time to study for my job (which my boss has noticed and was impressed i took initiative on) - that will mean doing my job better, and getting a better raise next year. i have also talked to my friends and family on the phone more and found out what's going on with them. even having the space to make healthy meals and exercise has been a huge benefit for my mood.

and, i did carve out space in my budget for saving for a new car and some vacations. while continuing to put away towards my emergency fund.

side gigs are excellent opportunities to get yourself out of bad financial situations. overall i don't regret it - but in hindsight, i wish i had made a game plan to know when to stop. it's easy to become addicted to the extra income, but it's not worth it at your own expense as a human being. side gigs are just that - something you do on the side because it's either fulfilling or getting you out of a bad spot, not a permanent band aid.

i didn't expect my rant to be this long! but i hope it helps others not lose themselves in the pursuit of money.

edit: just wanted to say that i love the discussions happening in the comments. it's great to hear the pros and cons of side gigs, when to halt and when to take it to the next level, and all the gray area and special circumstances around the gigs and ""side job"" culture. you hear ""find a second method of income"" as part of a lot of financial advice, but there's much more to it than just showing up and waiting for the money. thank you all for your input!",10
"i negotiated a $12,000 hospital bill to $1,500. my wife got diagnosed with cancer this past june and we were uninsured. we finally got insurance through the aca in july, but she had a $12,000 procedure done earlier in june. i set this bill up on a payment plan with the hospital but i was struggling because i left my job back in january. my wife's cancer is terminal so she requires full time care leaving me unable to seek employment at the moment. 

after reading some advice here, i spoke to their billing department and asked how one might qualify for financial assistance. they sent me some paperwork in the mail asking about our situation and to provide justification along with any documentation. i provided a verification of my employment dates, my lay off notice from my employer, a copy of the unemployment payments made to me, and wrote a statement explaining my wife's cancer and my inability to join the work force. 

two weeks later they sent a notice stating we've been approved for a reduced payment of 90%, now owing approximately $1,500. 

what a huge burden that's been lifted off my shoulders. 

i hope this info helps someone else. 

*edit* - people arguing with me over the semantics of the word negotiated. you're right. wrong word to use. 

the actual bill was not exactly $12,000 but very close. 

as for not getting cobra, the premium was $1,000 a month for my wife and i. she is 29 and i am 34. both relatively healthy and have never been to the doctor. we blew it off. blew off the aca too. huge mistake and life lesson harshly learned. ",10

"can we successfully sue someone ""advertising"" items on our property?. my father lives on an 18-acre wooded property in oregon that he and i jointly own (i live in california). he's into classic car restoration and started collecting ""barn finds"" over 20 years ago. today he has more than 40 vehicles on the property, mostly in barns and old chicken coops, but all relatively well cared for. most are classic cars worth non-trivial amounts of money (old fords and hudsons, 1960's muscle cars, that sort of thing), and he's whiling away his retirement years pulling the cars out one by one to restore and sell off.

about a year ago he started noticing small thefts from some of the cars. hubcaps started vanishing, engine parts would disappear from previously running cars, one car had its interior partially stripped. he initially assumed that it was local thieves until a couple of months ago when he caught a couple of videographers going through one of his barns, documenting everything inside of it. while they waited for the sheriff to arrive (at gunpoint, fwiw), the videographers explained that they'd learned about the property through a ""barn finds"" auto blog and discussion board. apparently, the property had been ""found"" about 18 months previously, was described as abandoned and had been visited a number of times by the members of this barn finds forum. they also solved a mystery. about six months prior, my dad had found some deep muddy ruts on an abandoned access road at the back of the property. we learned that a group of these guys had tried to ""rescue"" a very valuable and collectible car stored in one of the outbuildings, but had got stuck in the mud and had been planning on trying again. 

the property is now very well marked with signs prohibiting access, and we've re-strung the barbed wire fences around the perimeter. my dad also felled three trees to block some of the old access roads on the side and rear of the property to prevent any additional ""rescue attempts"". 

our problem is that the original website still has the information online including detailed photos of everything we have on the property. they are still listing the exact location of the land, including directions about how to approach it to ""avoid neighbors"", but have added a few comments about ""an angry old man living in a neighboring house who is trying to claim the abandoned property and derelict cars"". since catching the trespassers, our fences have been cut three times, a number of additional parts have vanished (including an irreplaceable steering wheel from a 1938 mercedes benz), and the barns have been forcibly broken into several times.

so here's my question. because this all started when the blogs primary authors trespassed on our property, documented our cars, and falsely labeled them as ""abandoned"", and because they continue to list them on their website, is there any chance that we could successfully sue them and recover some of the losses we've experienced over the past year? between the new fence, signage, and the value of the lost parts, he estimates that we're probably out more than $15,000 at this point. we've identified the owner of the blog and believe that he has the financial resources to pay a judgment, but i'm not sure whether it's worth the effort. i personally know two lawyers. one is telling me to sue their arse off, and the other is telling me that we'd be wasting our time and money. 

so, /r/legaladvice, what's your take? do we have a case?",2
"for using my boyfriend's phobia to prove a point?. this happened a little over a week ago and i still feel bad about it. so, my boyfriend has a bit of a hobby collecting knives. switchblades, butterfly knives, he's pretty proud of all of them. now, i have a small phobia of my own. my father was very abusive, and of the few memories i have of him, he was often threatening an infant me with a switchblade. as such, i'm very uncomfortable around them. my boyfriend will often point his in my direction, and when i get upset and tell him to stop he says i need to get over it. that i might need to use one some day. that i should know he'd never hurt me. i guess he feels like if he exposes me to it enough, i'll learn to trust that he won't stab me with it? but it's not like i think that to begin with, i'm just uncomfortable around them.

well, he has a very intense phobia of a specific monster. i don't question it. for some reason, it's much more intense than my mild annoyance/breath stopping moment at the blades. he completely freaks out at even just a picture, shuts down, has nightmares for nights. if there's a chance of one showing up in a video he will whimper and whine and either stop it all together or close his eyes and ask me to tell him when it is over. i promised him early on that i didn't find it funny like some of his friends do and wouldn't use it to prank him.

well, the other night after cutting some cheese with his stupid knife, he tried waving it at me, knowing how uncomfortable it makes me. so i pulled up a particularly horrifying image of his phobia on my phone and shoved it in his face. ""how does it feel? you know what a phobia is like, right? just get over it!"" i tried to paraphrase him, and he got really upset. i feel like i may have gone overboard and honestly feel guilty, but he hasn't messed with me since.",3
"as a former helicopter parent and current mother of a 23 suicidal son, please take my advice. do not smother your kids, do not try to mold them to be the perfect child. let them be independent and take risks.. i wanted the best for my son, so i scheduled his entire life. i grew up around 3 brothers, who spent their teenage years in the 80s drinking, doing drugs, partying, fucking girls. they slacked off, and i hated it. i hated their attitude towards life, i hated them for how unproductive they were. i wanted my son to be nothing like them. i had this image of my son being this smart, witty hipster kid who, on his own accord, said no to partying and drugs because *he was better than that.* i saw what the stereotypes of kids today were, and i was happy to see him grow up in this generation, which seemed to be more accepting. 

except, around 13-14, things changed. i saw him hang out with different kids. i found out he cut his after school art class, i found him kissing a girl at 13, he wanted different clothing, he started listening to hip-hop. my dream of a smart hipster accepting kid was fading away, and my reaction was to smother him. no hanging out after school, i have to talk to his friends parents always if he is going to see friends, i have to make sure his friends are the 'right type' to be hanging out with. it got to the point where i told him he cant listen to certain music because it was too crude or had curses in it. no violent movies. no over sexualized movies. i picked out his clothing, i told him he cant wear his more 'edgy' clothing. no hanging out in the park, no hanging out on the streets at all. no going to parties unless there are parents there. no violent video games. no going to the sketchy bodega. i tried at one point to make him eat vegan and organic food only. i made him read books i picked out for him, feminist books mostly. 

i did everything in my power to make sure he was the right type of person. i didn't want him to have fun, i didn't let him choose his own time. because he would have chosen the wrong things, and fun usually just means up to no good right? so i didn't like the idea of him having fun, as many excuses as i made, that was it. fun to a teen boy, to me, was getting drunk at a party and doing something you will regret. not my kid. 

i tried molding him, and in the end, he became sheltered from the world entirely. at 17 he was going off to college, and we spent 2 weeks at my sisters house. those 2 weeks were just so eye opening to me. my sisters kids were 16 and 17 and they just seemed so much more mature, so much more socially healthy than my son. they had a lot of friends, they had girlfriends. the parents looked the other way to the older son drinking a few beers with friends. the kids listened to whatever they wanted, they watched whatever movies they wanted, they hung out with whoever. the older son had a public enemy shirt on, something i would have disproved of for my son. but he was... just so much more mature. 

my son went to college for 9 weeks, then dropped out. he came home, telling me college was too overwhelming. he became depressed. i still tried to withhold him from bad influences, but after some eye opening events i realized how wrong this was. and i also realized it was too late. he was 18 years old with the maturity and life-exposure level of a 12 year old. i got him to move out at 20, with my help, to an apartment only 4 blocks away. 

i wish i could say he has done better. it has been 5 years, 7 suicide attempts, no friends, no girlfriends. i give him 400 bucks a month for his apartment. he doesnt blame me, but i blame myself. i really fucking do. 

let your child be themselves. let them take risks. if they fuck up in some way, if you catch them drinking with friends at 17, learn to look the other way sometimes. they dont have to be perfect, but they have to be themselves. i never learned this. i wish i fucking did when i had him.

"my (39m) wife (39f) is being recruited by now bdsm ex-bf. what in the ever-living-fuck?!. my (39m) wife (39f) of 8 years has recently started talking to an ex-bf (40m).  their history goes back 15+ years but luckily we live across the country from him.  he's married now for 4 years (we attended their wedding, lol) but they have no kids.  my wife and i have two young boys, and up until now - everything was seemingly fine (isn't that always the case?).

i only found out of their recent contact since she left her email open on my computer before leaving for work.  a quick search lead to several threads that went from innocent to disgusting with a quickness.  they reminisced about their previous escapades and then things took a turn - he's into bdsm now and is trying to recruit her into meeting up and participating.  from what i've seen, she thinks ""it's hot"" and is on board.  i'd say my wife and i have an average sex life but never once was anything of the sort discussed with me (i'm not into that stuff but that's not the point).  he boldly claims that his wife and i ""don't need to know"" and it'll be their ""little escape"".  anyway, the chances of anything happening in his city are slim since we rarely visit and if we do we are always with family.  but there was some discussion of the ex-bf trying to arrange a work training here so they could ""meet"".   i have no idea if this has actually happened yet.

their threads have been sporadic over the span of 3 months and i can see that some replies from her where deleted from her inbox but were included in his replies.  to me, this show all shows intent, but i'll be honest - i've seen enough.  again, i have no proof she's actually cheated but i don't know if i even need to know.  i never thought anything like this would happen.  i've been completely faithful to her all this time, and for all intents and purposes.. a good husband?

i'm obviously distraught about this... haven't eaten in two days.. feel empty inside.  i actually cried when dropping my kids off for school today.

&#x200b;

so, reddit - how do i approach this?  do i mail the ex-bf's new wife the explicit conversations and let things sort themselves out from that side?  do i simultaneously tell both? do i just confront her and have her beg for forgiveness?  do i let things progress and try and catch her in the act?  do i just lawyer up now?  and the timing... her family is coming for the holidays and i could totally fucking wreck christmas or try and pretend everything is cool for my kids' sake while being a hollow shell of a dad for the next few weeks... i'm so lost.  i feel betrayed.  this is awful.

update thursday - what a week this has been.  got some great and not-so-great advice here and some sincere pms from folks who had experienced similar situations, but in the end i followed my gut.  given the timing of everything with the holidays and no desire to derail things for my kids, i had plenty of time to think formulate a plan for how this was all going to go down.  i had all the bases covered and considered all scenarios.  i met with lawyer on monday to discuss worst case and then scheduled an emergency counseling session for today.  i confronted my wife last night and she reacted exactly how i suspected - remorseful and apologetic - not angry and combative.  she explained that she enjoyed the attention but assured me nothing ever happened and that she had no intention of seeing any of it through.  she admitted it was wrong and totally stupid on her part.  she begged for forgiveness.  i spent the night away last night in an effort to allow myself to recharge but also to allow her to reflect on what she did and how she intends on fixing it.  she knows she broke our trust and she knows there's a long road to recovery.  she knows what's at stake here.  we have a lot of work ahead of us and it certainly won't be easy but we're now headed in the right direction - together.

"my dad killed himself, and i have a message for you.. apologies if this isn't appropriate for this sub. i'm really unsure where else it would go. (sorry, on mobile)

18 years ago today, my father committed suicide, at the age of 46. 

although we knew depression ran in his family (his own mother committed suicide when he was a child), he exhibited no signs of depression, or expressed suicidal thoughts. ever. 

we had a happy life. he and my mother had been together since they were teenagers, and were truly happy. he had what seemed, everything to live for. yet, on the afternoon of february 23, 2001, my dad left a note on our screened porch, telling my mom not come outside, and hung himself in the shed behind our house. 

i've read many posts and comments here of those suffering and contemplating taking their own life. for what it's worth, and it may not be worth much, but that voice - the one that is telling you it's for the best, and your loved ones are better off? that the pain is too much to continue? that you are a burden to those around you? it's not true. i am not dismissing your feelings, i'm really not. i just want you to know, as a person on the other side of suicide, that voice is wrong. 

it may be situational — an episode in your life that seems hopeless. or maybe you've suffered with depression and these thoughts for years, and you just want it to stop. so you make the decision. you plan, and you are finally at peace because you know the end is near. that's one part people don't understand. how could someone go about their lives as if everything was ok? ""they were happy! it doesn't make sense!"" ""they finally seemed to be ok!"" 

but think about it. when you have what seems to be an impossible problem, how do you feel and act when you finally find a solution? you feel relieved. calm. sometimes even euphoric. 

i can only imagine the pain my father was going through to have chosen to leave us in such a way. but the days leading up to his death, he seemed so happy. the day of, he and my mom went to lunch, spoke of plans about moving down south to be closer to my sister and i, and even spoke of plans that evening to have dinner with friends. 

i was 22 when he died. i was so angry right after. we all were. how could a man with so much to live for, who had such a wonderful life, choose to kill himself? we were totally blindsided, and thought what a selfish, deplorable thing he did. 

how wrong i was. 

since then, after research, talking with suicide survivors, and those who have lost loved ones, plus suffering from my own depression, i now know it isn't selfish. to the sufferer, it's selfless. sufferers are totally convinced their absence from this earth will be a relief for those who love them. one less burden. the feelings are real, and they are persistent. 

i'm not sure what i'm trying to say. i guess i'm talking to both sides. if you've lost someone to suicide, try not to be angry. it'll be hard, trust me, i know. but after 18 years, i'm not angry. i'm just so fucking sad. sad he had to suffer in silence. sad he'll never know his grandkids, or see what my sister had i have accomplished. sad my mom still cries for him and misses him everyday. sad i can't get his advice or hear his corny jokes when i'm down. 

i'm writing this to you. 

you are loved. you are worth it. you will be so very missed. this pain is real. but it doesn't have to be permanent. reach out. talk. share. there is no shame. 

the voices are temporary. they can be silenced, and there is help. 



edit: i am reading every one of your comments. i am overwhelmed, and so grateful to those of you that shared your own suffering, and those with loved ones lost to suicide. you are all stronger than you know. if any of you need to talk, feel free to message me:) 

thank you for the silver and gold:) very appreciated. ",11

"should i sell my first home with a $130-150k profit? then rent or buy another home?. i grew up really poor and moved around a lot. my so also moved around a ton growing up. at one point he moved seven times in one year. when we got together and became a little more financially stable, we bought a house four years ago and we both finally felt like we had a home. the market and the area we live in is booming like crazy so we've been considering selling. 3-4 of our friends have already sold and pocked over 100k. one bought a bigger home, and the others are renting, and waiting for the market to go down. it is an option to have this be our forever home, but the prospect of a lump sum of cash is tempting. 

should we sell our home and pay off our debts we've incurred, then rent or buy? so is the only one working right now. i go to school and have about $60k saved up, but have credit card debt and student loans. so has a lot of cc debt. he wants to rent and wait til the market levels off, but i want to pay down half our debt, put some money towards our wedding, then put down for a slightly bigger brand new home, while still saving a small portion to invest in index funds.  we do currently rent out our rooms, and would continue to rent out a room or two in our new home to help pay down principle/create a lovely backyard. we did this with our first home to furnish our entire place within the year. what are your thoughts?

edit: 
just woke up and trying to read through the comments, which i appreciate everyone's input. just for clarification:

i only have $8 grand in cc debt (zero percent interest from a balance transfer). the rest is $27k in student loans i incurred when i lost my fafsa because i started making money. $11k of it was when i was an 18 year old idiot and used the money unwisely, but stopped going to school when i was 20 to work and buy my current home. 15k i would like to pay asap, because it's unsubsidized loans ranging from 3-5%, but i still get a better return in the stock market, but i don't wanna pull out money to pay that down. i own my home with my so so he would get a portion of the profits to pay down his debts as he sees fit. 

the reason i haven't entirely paid down my debt is because i'm currently laid off and i think cash is king. i can pay my mortgage, which is priority number 1 with cash, but everything else can be bought with a credit card. i will be working in a couple months forsure. my job can usually net between $50-80k if i work full time, but i haven't been offered a full time position in two years. all in total, my bills are only $950-1050/month. my car has been paid off for two and a half years and i bought he brand new when i was 18, i'll ride that bitch til it dies. anything i make more than that pays debt. i use my credit card for travel points so there's always a rotating balance, but i do want a significant portion paid down.  

once i start working full time again, i plan on crushing down my credit card debt and student loans within the year, especially if we don't sell the house for a profit. unfortunately my ccs have been carrying me, but i didn't ask to be laid off. and as i've stated, you can delay paying off cc complete, but your mortgage needs to be paid with cash. we pay all our bills on time. 

my so struggled with addiction and racked up ccs without my knowledge. he's been clean for 2 and a half years and i'm trying to help him dig himself out the hole. he makes anywhere from 40-55k. i handle all the money and try to make 2-3k in payments each month depending on how much he makes. 

12k is in 401k
47k is in index funds/roth ira 

i rotate with about $3-5k in cash at all times because i don't want to touch my investments. to clarify, i'm not waiting for the stock market to go down, i'm considering waiting for the housing market to level off. i don't live in california, so it's not entirely unlikely, but like others have stated, it's also all speculation. the other option is to sell my current house and buy 5-7 min away from where i currently live to a ""cheaper"" area but the house is still $350k. and it would be closer to work. we bought our house for $220k brand new from the ground up and still owe $200k. we would net about $130k. our new house would also be a brand new build. 

we have considered refinancing and taking out a heloc, but a lump some of cash is just as enticing. it would prolly shave off $2-300 off of our mortgage which is $1550. 

soooo if we sold i can just pay off the 8k in cc and 15k in student loans, rent in a cheaper area or put down on our forever home. 

long term: 
-finish school. 
-destination wedding (i know people have strong opinions, but as we get older this may be the last time our friends and family can get together before life takes up all the time). plus traveling is very important to us.
-stay in current home or buy our next forever home
-keep funding my index funds

now fast forward to four days ago, the day of the threesome. i was very nervous, but my husband was excited to "" finally be able to have a good man in him"" as he said. we got to jim's house, and were brought inside. we had a few drink and then started. i don't want to make this too nsfw but what i will say was that both of them were involved with each other and me in multiple ways. but i guess my husband wanting for men was more than i expected, because after a few minute of foreplay and intercourse, it turned into my husband and jim just having normal sex. i saw what was happening, grabbed my clothes, ran out the house and into my car, and drove away almost in tears. some people might see this as an overreaction, but in my mind, all my husband was doing was cheating on me with another man. i later texted him and told him he could stay at jim's house overnight, he wasn't welcome here. later the next day jim dropped my husband off, who was not apologetic at all. he was mad at me for driving away, saying that he did nothing wrong, and that he just wanted to satisfy his needs. most of our other friends also sided with him, saying that he needs a man every now and then.


so what do you think reddit, for having a ""threesome"" with my husband and his friend?

"i'm lying to my best friend. my best friend and i have been friends for over 6 years. in november of 2018, she got married and her husband was deployed shortly after. he's been gone since and she thinks he's not coming home for a few months. 

he and i have secretly been messaging on facebook because we're setting up a plan to surprise her with him coming home 4 months early. he's on the phone with her saying they have to finish stuff up but he can't come home early and the ""wifi there sucks"" so she doesn't get suspicious. 

she's heartbroken because she's been hoping he's coming home early for a long time. she thinks he's stuck there for a few more months when he's really coming home early. i want to tell her so badly because i know she'll be excited but i want to surprise her with this because she misses him so so much. 

she cries almost every day whenever she thinks about him or talks about how much she misses him. it crushes me because i know that he'll be home soon but i don't want to ruin the surprise. 

tl;dr best friend thinks husband is going to be deployed for a few more months but we're surprising her with him coming home early

thank you for the silver you kind soul (:

"a plane is spotted trying to land at area 51. one day at area 51 a radar tech spots a single engine plane on final approach to the secret air force base. the plane touches down and is immediately surrounded by armed guards. the plane is impounded and the pilot is whisked off for questioning. the pilot claims that he had been flying from las vegas, gotten lost, and nearly run out of fuel, so he put his plane down at the first runway he saw. after extensive background checks, it is proven that the pilot isn't a spy and he is set to be released the following morning.

before he is allowed to leave, he is given the ""you didn't see anything"" talk, and is told that under absolutely no circumstances is he allowed to tell anyone where he was, or what he saw. the air force fuels up the man's plane, gives him a proper heading to get back to las vegas, and sends him on his way. 

later that day, the man's plane is again spotted getting ready to land at area 51. this time there are two people in the plane. when the plane touches down, it is immediately surrounded by guards again. as soon as it comes to a stop, the man hops out and yells: ""do whatever you want to me, but somebody has to tell my wife where i was last night.""

"if i set my mother in law up to drop in on my roommate jerking off?. so, the title is probably almost as weird as the actual explanation. bear with me.

i've got the typical awful, overbearing mil situation. the woman doesn't like me, hasnt for roughly 6 years now. her son and i have been together almost 7 years. we have two kids. she's done everything from boundary stomping, criticizing our parenting choices, threatening to have our child taken from us and placed in her custody if we moved out of state, and threatening to call cps if we didnt bow to her wishes. suffice to say this woman is insane, and we did end up moving 2000 miles away with zero chance of losing custody, obviously.

so, we are no contact with her off and on. currently we hear from her once every 3 months or so and see her once a year. the most recent time she was in town, she gave my boyfriend an amazon alexa for the kids. it's one of the fancy ones with the screen and camera for video chatting. now, maybe i'm just being petty because her and i obviously dont get on, but i'm not interested in seeing or hearing from her any more than we do already.

my boyfriends younger brother and his girlfriend, when they found out that she had gotten this for us, warned me to disable the drop in permissions because this woman was just randomly dropping into the device and accessing the camera into their apartment. so i was instantly suspicious of this fucking thing. i disabled the permissions, and the kids aren't allowed to use it unless someone is in the room anyway.

i was talking about how shady it was with our roommate, and he said that he had a much better idea than disabling it.

put it in his room, and any time he feels like it, he'll just jerk it while making direct eye contact with the camera.

i feel like disabling it is enough, but i would be lying if i said this wasn't a hilariously tantalizing prospect. is it over the top to do this if i'm pretty confident that she would just drop in and see this happening?

thanks in advance!

"by knocking up a girl on the first night, but wait. title says it all. i met her through tinder, the condom broke but she said not to worry because she's on the pill. fast forward a week, where i see her for the second time, and she tells me that she's pregnant. boring story, i know. now for the fun part. i saw self harm scars on her arm, but only on the second night (she insisted on having the lights off on the first night). she then proceeded to tell me that those were from her two previous abortions, where she was so tortured about it that she had to do this. and that now she probably couldn't handle a third abortion and that anyways she actually knows how to kill herself this time. my heart fucking sank, man. she's now coming over and will be here in an hour, so that we could continue talking. we barely slept because we were talking about it and she says she's 70% sure she wants to keep the baby, but that she wouldn't ask any help from me, except seeing the baby once in a while. i can barely believe what i'm typing right now. i bought two early pregnancy tests, the expensive kind. i don't know what to do. any advice?

​tl;dr i knocked up a girl on the first night seeing her, the crazy came out on the second night a week later with the news, and she's 70% sure she wants to keep it. send help.

update: holy shit i dodged the biggest fucking bullet ever, i feel like bullet bill just zipped passed my cranium.

so she got here and just acted all cool, asking about my day and stuff. she then went on to explain how she felt all bloated and preggo and i just couldn't believe the amount of bullshit coming out of her mouth. i cut her off and told her i didn't believe in the timing of things (i had looked it all up before she got here) and said that i needed actual proof.

her being a nurse, she insisted that she had access to blood test that could detect hcg levels only four days after conception, which i knew was bullshit. she was so manipulative, she kept on saying that ""she's in medical, so she just knows better"". and i just kept bringing up the 11-14 days period of time after conception needed to take a relevant blood test.

in the end i just told her that she was a bad liar and that her manipulation attempts were in vain. so i told her to leave, now. she called a friend to pick her up and then just stared at me, smiled and said that she would wait there, in my living room. and then the show began.

she said, among other things, ""why would i ever lie about being pregnant, i'm 21!"" ""you should be ashamed of making me feel like a dirty slut!"" ""how could i even be pregnant from another guy, you're the only guy i've been with recently"" ""oh, by the way, i already have a son, i know how these things work"". gems.

her still being in my living room, i told her to leave or i'd call the cops. she smiled the sassiest smile at me, so i did. after some more back and forth she eventually went outside on the steps while saying how much of a white guy kind of thing i was doing by calling the cops (she is half carribean half european, but basically black).  i closed the door with an intentionally loud sigh. fin

anyways, thanks for the support everyone, it truly helped me.

update #3: so i'm staying as far away as possible. haven't had contact with her since theses texts. now for timeline clarification; we met for the first time last tuesday, and again monday night. she said she wanted to get a hold of me during the weekend to tell me about it, which implies a test on friday, not even 72 hours after ""conception"". she then changed her story saying she got the test on sunday to try to make it more believable timewise i guess. she insisted that she's pregnant and that it's mine. so she basically announced all of that to me 6 days after we first met. when i asked for her to take the test for me she flat out refused, citing disrespect on my part. oh and the last kicker? right before leaving she said ""that's why i shouldn't have told you, all guys react the same"". now please refer to me as neo.",4
"by trimming my junk. so, this actually happened last night. yesterday was my wife's birthday and as a surprise i decided to trim the jungle that resided below for some sexy time fun. now, i'm one of those men who has a slight pot belly and over the years it has gotten bigger causing this task to be increasingly difficult. no big deal. despite limited visibility i can generally feel my way through the deforestation, or so i thought. i get about 90% of the way through my task and all that's left is the front of my berries. here is where i fuck up. usually i look down and stretch/flatten my saddlebags so i provide a flat surface for the electric trimmer to glide against. in my haste i was not looking very closely and assumed the lawn was flat. unfortunately, it was not. the electric trimmer grabbed hold of a fold of skin and thrashed it like a dog playing with a toy. i felt a burning pain and immediately withdrew. now, i have nicked myself before so i imagined it was just a slight cut. as i looked down i realized this was not a tiny cut. blood was dripping off my love sac at an alarming rate. as i dab the blood and reveal the damage i am in shock. i had about 1/8 inch wound i could probably fit a pencil eraser in. i walked over to my wife and told her something happened. as i revealed my mangled manhood she let out a gasp. no sexy time tonight. we bandaged my wounded soldier as best as we could and went to sleep. today it looks better. i think it will heal on its own without the need of an embarrassing doctor visit. guys, make sure the lawn is flat before driving the mower over it.

update: in line at urgent care. thanks to those who suggested i go see a doctor. i'll post another update after.

update 2: ok, fresh out of the docs office. 2 stitches in my sac, tetanus shot in arm, antibiotics prescribed. thanks for all the recommendations and kind words. my soldier will live to fight another day.

update 3: so after reading so many suggestions i ordered a new trimmer specifically designed for the task. my dad always says ""use the right tool for the job"". i will be throwing away the ballmuncher 2000 when i get home.

update 4: thank you all! i never imagined that posting something on reddit about my balls would be so popular! i appreciate all the suggestions and kind words. i am trying to keep up with all your comments. this has truly been an amazing experience!

update 5: it's been fun everyone! i am retiring for the night and wont be responding to any more comments today. thank you!

edit: for those wondering why i didn't use a guard... i was using a guard. the skin folded and went in between one of the prongs. this was my fuckup, i didn't stretch it flat.

edit: for those who think this is a marketing ad... i promise, it is not. if the new trimmer i bought is shit ill update this post with relevant information.

edit: spelling, formatting, clarification

update 5/2/19: so i healed up real nice. i have a little scar but nothing too significant. i finally got around to using my new trimmer. i have been avoiding it out of fear from the last encounter with the ballmuncher 2000. the lawn mower works...ok. it is not as fast as the ole ballmuncher, but it did get the job done. i think it's a bit slower because of the size of the blades. it's also possible i was going slower out of fear of slicing my sac open again. the new trimmer is significantly smaller and lighter than my old one. it is easier to handle and i don't have to fight a cord anymore. i like the non slip surface on the new trimmer, however i fear it will take a dive in the toilet one day and ill need to fish it out. not sure it will survive the plunge. is it worth $60? at this time i am not sure. if it lasts just as long as my first one, then sure. so far so good. if anything changes ill update this post again. thanks everyone!

"my family is forcing me to co-sign a mortgage loan. the thing is i'm the only person in the house that doesn't have debt and have good credit (~700). my mom is forcing me to co-sign a 250k mortgage loan on the house with 5.2% interest. obviously, i'm not comfortable with this. i'm a full-time college student who work two part time jobs. she and my aunt are the ones who's going to pay and they promised me that it won't be an issue where this comes up but nothing is ever guaranteed in life. i need help i don't know much and my family shunned me when i said i don't want to sign it.

my question is what is the pros and cons of this? i'm so lost and i need help. they said worst case scenario if we can't make more payments then they will find someone to buy it off of us and it won't be an issue but what happens to me if we got foreclosed on?  

edit: i really am overwhelmed by a lot of this. i didn't expect this post to get a lot of responses but i really appreciate all of the inputs here. everyone say the same thing but it is really hard for me to process right now since this is such a huge change in my life if things go south.

"for bribing a guy into an arranged marriage?. for background i am a 22 year old woman from a large middle eastern nation. in my culture arranged marriages are quite common amongst the religious population.

ali and i are both studying civil engineering. i have been in love with him since grade 1 of university. the problem is he has deep feelings for a syrian girl who also ran away to my country. she doesn't want to be with him as far as i know. since we are nearing graduation, i want to tell him that if he lets her go and chooses to start a relationship with me then him and his family would be financially secure for life. i want to propose this idea to him and his mother. i am not technically persuading him to marry me, but if he does he would be saving his family from ever having to go back to syria. and he would know this. for making this offer?

throwaway, first time poster, english not first language, tldr at the end, blabla... i am 21

we've been together for 4 years. at the beginning, like all teenagers do, we also fooled around, she was genuinely turned on and wanted to do stuff but we never got to penetration. we were both virgin and to her, virginity was always the best thing she can give me, it's ""the only thing she can give only to me in the whole life"" and to be honest, that's why i\21m\ didn't push for it at all and wanted the take her pace.

around 2-2.5 years ago, things started to cool down. she no longer wanted to do it(referring to touching and oral) as often and a year ago she started pushing away even though i would ask twice a month when i was sexually frustrated. i really loved her, and i still do, and i think she is smart, intelligent and beautiful and that's why that wasn't a deal breaker for me.

two weeks after our 4 years mark, she said she felt trapped and that she wanted to take a little break from our relationship. i was crushed because i didn't see this coming at all. her ""trapped"" definition was that she felt bad going to concerts and doing stuff without inviting me, and to be honest, i always encouraged her to go with her girlfriends and have fun, i have a feeling she trapped herself? i think she just wanted to take a break and couldn't come up with a better reason or the real reason was offending to me or she just lost attraction although she denied it. we talked it through and we decided that we will take a break and she will call me once the break is over. she was supposed to move in with me in may.

it took a toll on me, i performed bad at my work and i was distant from my family, i was crushed and i hoped she would come back and that we would cry together, agree it was a mistake and move on.

well, after around 3 weeks, she messaged me and said she wanted to talk. i was so excited and i invited her to my house. when she arrived, shortly after, she basically broke down crying, saying she met a guy\23m\ 2 weeks ago and that after 3 days they slept together. she said she tried to connect with him but it wasn't nearly as fun as with me and that she wasn't sure why she wanted to take a break from me in the first place. now, i consider myself 7-8/10, i am tall and work out semi-regularly. she assured me that it wasn't my looks. she said she wanted us to be together again and that she would do anything to earn back my trust and make me happy. the guy she slept with was 10/10 and a lot of muscle, although i didn't know him or anything about him.

this happened yesterday. i am broken. i couldn't come up with words and just said it's gonna be okay and later politely asked her to leave so i have time and space to think. i can't help it but feel like a backup plan, she sacrificed our 4 years together and basically made me a fool for waiting for sex and thinking that i am something special for her. it bothers me so much that she was ready to fuck some guy, less than a week after we broke up. even if we get back together, am i supposed to have sex with her now or what...

i will provide more information if needed, but i am really struggling for some advice on what to do.

we were both really into the show we were watching when suddenly i felt a sharp pain on the top of my penis. i mean like a turtle had just reached out and latched on. i screamed in pain at first and looked down to realize my son had shifted his head slightly against the shorts i was wearing, and just chomped down. he may still be a baby but he has some sharp ass teeth.

i grabbed him to get him off and my wife didn't understand what was happening. she thought i was just randomly in pain and trying to throw our son. it looked like that, well, because he wouldn't freaking let go. i finally tugged him away and to the floor and he screamed crying as my wife went to console him and i got up and cupped a hand to my crotch and paced back and forth with a feeling i'd never felt before.

i walked outside to get away from the crying for a moment and stinging pain wasn't stopping. after a few moments i returned inside and looked inside my pants to survey the damage. my penis was bleeding from the tip. he left a freaking indention with his teeth. still hurts today every time anything brushes against it. i'll be way more cautious going forward about where he's laying his head. my wife later laughed and called him amazing birth control.

except... well, we ended up having sex. i knew him to be flirty with the other employees, but then one night it was just us and everyone else left (we would have little parties every thursday and saturday after closing) and he got flirty with me. i was drunk and we had sex in my office. unprotected unfortunately, but it was kind of a heat of the moment thing. 

&#x200b;

i suppose in the moment i just ignored that he was family. he looks literally nothing like us, his dad was from lebanon and his mom was spanish, he has thick dark curly hair and brown eyes, meanwhile our family is swedish and blonde with blue eyes with round faces. it wasn't hard for me to imagine in the moment that he wasn't family. the alcohol helped. 

&#x200b;

except since then, we have had sex 3 more times in the past 3 weeks. i cant even resist him. sometimes all that is needed to set me off is when his shirt is just slightly unbuttoned at the top and i can see his chest... ugh. 

&#x200b;

i feel like such an idiot. hes my god damn nephew, and everyone in our office knows it. we share a damn last name! its just too weird, but i also feel sometimes like there's no real point in me resisting it. i mean, sex is sex right? and we aren't really related, so what's the big deal? ",12
"roommate spends all his time at sos apartment.. moved in with two friends in february, one roommate got a so soon after and has been spending 80% of his time at her place. almost never see him, except randomly during the week and on weekends.

&#x200b;

he recently decided that he didn't want to pay for utilities anymore.

as he is making the personal choice to spend more time at his sos place but still wants to come and go using the water and electricity and internet i do not feel his argument is valid.

&#x200b;

i say he should have to pay them as he signed a lease and when moving in together it was agreed upon that we would split everything 3 ways. he is fully aware i do not have as much financial flexibility as he does, and have to budget more strictly.

am i wrong in this situation? anybody else have a similar experience they could share?

&#x200b;

thanks!

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

update: 

&#x200b;

 

thanks for all the feedback!

the amount of time he stays with us is so variable that its near impossible to pro rate if we wanted to.

often times his so and her dog will stay with us for extended periods of time, just not as often as him being gone.

this past summer for example she and her very poorly trained dog were at the house m-friday every week for 3 months. sharing a bathroom/power etc. never asked her to pay a dime. also her dog left permanent damage to the house, which will most definitely result in us not getting our deposits back, and possible extra fines as we aren't allowed pets.

i don't feel like hes earned any sort of mercy or leniency based on his track record. i will force a sit down and go from there.

thanks again!

"(new york) girlfriend is pregnant. i want the baby, she wants to give up for adoption. what does the law say? (update). i guess it's time for me to post an update to this(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5pbvb7/new_york_girlfriend_is_pregnant_i_want_the_baby/) post. i don't have a happy update however. so much has happened.

on the advice of this sub i went to a lawyer and did all the necessary paperwork. my girlfriend changed her mind a few times between wanting to raise the baby with me and wanting adoption but in the final weeks of the pregnancy she told me that i'm not the father at all. i thought she was lying so i asked to do a test. we went and did one of the prebirth blood tests and the result was negative. she was telling the truth. i wasn't the father.

i broke up with her her then. i was so heartbroken. she had cheated on me and made me think i was going to be a father for months. i was curious about who the father was though. i asked her and she told me that it's the man who is going to adopt the child from her! yes. this man fucked my girlfriend and now wants to adopt his own baby from my girlfriend with his wife who had no idea.

i thought his wife deserves to know so i went to their house (when he wasn't home) and told his wife everything. she had a complete breakdown in front of me. i felt sad that i caused this but i imagine it was her husband who cheated on her that really caused it. she called my now ex girlfriend to get confirmation and she told her the truth then called her husband and that was when i left.

now the baby is born and i've heard that my ex girlfriend and the man have moved in together in an apartment and are raising the baby! i guess his wife will divorce him soon.

it will take me years to recover from this. i thank you for your advice and help. it's sad that things turned out this way and i hope this baby grows up to be a decent person despite being raised by two cheaters. ",2
"my first time buying condoms, at age 16, i went to the pharmacy. the hot cashier at the counter could see that i was new at it and gave me the pack asking if i knew how to use one. i said, ""no, it's my first time."". 

she took one out, put it on her thumb, and told me to make sure it was on tight.

i still looked confused.

she looked around the store to see if it was empty and it was. 

""just a minute."" she said and locked the door.

she led me to the back room, took off her shirt and bra.

""you like these?""

i could only nod my head.

she said to put the condom on.

as i was putting it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and laid down.

""come on."" she said. ""we don't have much time.""

so i climbed on her.

it was so amazing that i couldn't hold back and kapow! i was done in two minutes!

she looked at me concerned and asked, ""did you put the condom on?""

i said, ""i sure did!""

"for repurposing the wedding fund and refusing to compromise?. i have 2 kids, different dads. i have a savings account for both. the account of my oldest, lucy, has had £10 per week added to it by both myself and her father, and has gone up by about a grand a year and is over £13,000. the second account is for my son, luke, who is 6. i have regularly added to this account since i found out i was pregnant, and have about 3.5k in the account.

his father, my fiance, had a separate account for luke and has told me he was doing the £10 a week since we started the accounts. i recently found out the account he has for luke only has a couple hundred in it. my fiance earns less than me but more than my ex. if my ex can afford £10 a week routinely, when he has nearly identical spending habits to me and my fiance but lives alone and therefore pays for rent/bills in full, and my fiance earns more than my ex, there is no reason my fiance should not have been able to make the £10 payments each week (i earn the most of all 3 of us, followed by my fiance, followed by ex). my fiance said he ""forgot"" and asked me to redistribute the contents of lucy's fund to make up for the money missing from luke's. i said fuck no.

luke's account is around 3k less than it should be. we have a wedding fund that contains a little over 2k of mine and my fiance's combined money. we don't want a huge wedding but we do want a really nice honeymoon where we can just go away for a week and not worry about money while we're there or returning.

my fiance says that he doesn't have the money to replace the 3k luke is missing all at once. i have said that i want to take the wedding fund as it currently stands and deposit the lot into the savings account i control that is meant for luke. i would not be doing this if my fiance had not 1) lied for around 7 years about saving for our son, 2) claimed he did not have the money to replace it, 3) suggested i take money from my daughter, saved up with help from my ex, to fix my fiance's mistake. i also said that i want him to set up a direct deposit of £10 to the account that only i control each week. i will not budge on any of this as we agreed years ago now that this was a good idea and that it was important to invest in our son's future, and he has lied to me for 7 years now about making that investment.

aita?

&#x200b;

for people asking why this is so urgent to me: it's not the end of the world if the full amount isn't in luke's account any time soon, as the plan was always to give each kid the total in the account when they were 18/moving out, but my fiance says he can't afford to repay the money in bulk or multiple installments and if he keeps on not paying, then when lucy is 18 she'll have 19-20 grand, and when luke is 18 he'll get closer to 10k from just me. while i don't doubt he'd be grateful for whatever he gets, he'd get half of what lucy will if my fiance doesn't make up the difference.

&#x200b;

update:

i asked him again why he didn't have the money. he said he just didn't. i asked him to bring up his bank statement, or payslip, or anything that shows how much money he has (bearing in mind he was last paid on the 28th and today is the 30th). he refused. i told him that if we were combining finances in any way i should be able to see where his money is going. he responded that i wasn't showing him my financial information, so i pulled up my banking app so he could see my own balance and transaction history. he then showed me his last statement, which his bank emailed him today. we had a fight and he's staying in a hotel tonight, which it turns out he can more than afford. he has nearly 60k in his personal current account and savings accounts, presumably meant solely for himself.

i cannot see us getting married after this. not ever. it's not just the trust issue, but also that he, knowing he had nearly 60k in savings, decided that it was okay to try and guilt trip me into taking money meant for my daughter to fix it for him.",3

"i 25f urgently called my colleague 28m about a disaster with our current work after he had left for the day, and now i have to speak to his girlfriend, and also send her photos of all emails between us. my colleague and i have been working on a super important/confidential project this week, i work until 6pm and he works until 3pm. 

at 5pm, i realised 70% of our cases had disappeared. because of the seriousness of this information, we could be instantly dismissed if it got into the wrong hands. in a panic, i called him (for the first time ever in 6 months, might i add) while scrambling bits of paper and instantly shouted down the phone ""mate ive lost the cases"". luckily, although he sent me on a wild goose chase, he remembered he had put them in his locked cabinet for tomorrow. the phone call was ended with a thanks, the phone call lasted 55 seconds. 

about half an hour later, i was bombarded with phone calls from him. i ran out of the office in a panic and picked up, where he explained that i called him about the cases at a really really bad time. a bit confused, i apologised for calling him out of hours but it was seriously urgent. 

he went onto explain that his girlfriend had since become extremely angry and accused him of having an affair with me. with his voice trembling, he said to me that i needed to speak to his girlfriend on the phone to explain who i am and why i needed to contact him, and also all evidence of emails back and forth for the last six months. i kind of laughed in disbelief and said don't be so ridiculous, then he went completely silent and said ""you have to do this for me. please."" instantly i went a bit cold, because i've never heard a mans voice tremble like that. 

i agreed to do whatever would make the situation better for him and asked if he felt like he was in danger. he hesitated, but then said ""i don't know what else to do, she's really kicking off at me. please don't tell anyone about this"". i suggested to take himself away from the situation if he can and to contact a family member, friend or even the police if it felt necessary. i'm still waiting on contact from his girlfriend, but learning from personal experience of domestic abuse she will not contact me, only emotionally manipulate him into feeling like he did something wrong. 

he is a really relaxed, happy guy at work so to hear him frightened and manic has made me extremely concerned. 

what do i say when she calls? do i send her every single email for the last six months? do i try to talk to him tomorrow at work about it? do i stay away from his personal situation and mind my own business?

"if people can say that the reason the suicide rate among transexuals is so high because of the way society treats them. then its perfectly acceptable to apply the same logic to suicide among men. this is not to shit on transexuals by any stretch. but i hate when certain people keep saying the transsexuals have a high suicide rate because of the way cis people treat them. maybe there is a lot of truth to it. you can't deny transphobia exists. but simaltaneously in the western world suicide among men in twice as common among women. is that to say that society treats men worse than women if we are applying the same logic that we do to transexuals. by this logic men are much more oppressed than women. 

edit: i just wanted to clarify my intentions behind this post. it has a bit of a double meaning so to say. the main aim of this post isn't to say that men or women (and other groups) are the most oppressed. it was more to highlight how we use simplify a statistic to the point where we don't consider multiple reasons for it (in this case high suicide among transsexuals). i wanted to say that if we use such an approach to male suicide rate one by such ""incomplete"" logic. conclude that men just as transgenders are one of the most oppressed groups.

"me and my friends found 100 dollars on the ground, went to a diner and ordered tons of food. we were terrible to the staff, and when we realized the bill was way over 100 dollars, we ran out of the restaurant instead of paying.. i still feel haunted by this, even though its been 5-6 years. me and my two friends friend found a 100 dollar bill on the floor. obviously, we were super excited. we were 16 years old and the first thing that came to our minds was going to this diner in the upper west side and just ordering a huge amount of food after getting stoned. 

we went, we smoked at central park, then went to the diner, and ordered a shit load of food. we were terrible, we didn't order all at once, instead we did like 5 separate orders of food because we kept getting smaller meals and appetizers. we changed our mind twice and called obnoxiously to the waiter to come back and change our order. we also spilled a whole thing of mac and cheese onto the ground by accident. i could tell he was fed up with us. the worst part is that he was super cool and friendly at first, making jokes with us and all that, but as time went on we were just so awful to him that he stopped being friendly and instead got irritated. 

in the end... the bill was 119 dollars, excluding tip. we were so fucking dumb we just figured that it would be like 75-80, not over 100 dollars, we didn't even do the math when ordering our food. 

instead of apologizing, giving the money we had and saying we would pay the rest back the next day? we ran out of the restaurant. we didn't even leave the money we had. i cant even imagine how the guy felt coming back and seeing that we had left. we didn't even really feel remorse, we just laughed about how ridiculous the whole situation was.

"update: my 37m son 21m slept with my girlfriend 32, i don't know how to process this level of betrayal. original post can be found here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/98lvk9/trying_my_luck_on_this_sub_my_37m_son_21m_slept/) 

first off, i'd like to thank everyone for the enormous outpouring of support. i've had numerous people offering to their well-wishes privately and such compassion from those who commented. i believe it was this support, as well as that from my friends, that kept me from doing anything stupid. i'll try to keep this as concise and short sentenced as possible.

it's been a busy couple of days, to say the least. i unblocked both their numbers shortly after posting. my now ex called again that night, which i answered. i told her if she wasn't calling to make plans to pick up her stuff i was hanging up, and we decided on the next morning. i called a platonic female friend of mine that night and she agreed to be at my place before my ex showed up as a witness. i had everything packed up and waiting by the door. she showed up as expected and started crying immediately when i came out with her stuff, trying to pull the bags to the ground so i'd have my hands free for a hug. i put the bags beside her car and asked her to check if i missed anything, which she refused. i agreed to a quick hug, told her to take care and walked inside, my friend pulled the chair she was sitting in on my porch over so it was in front of my door, and told her that she was calling the cops if she didn't leave. she did, and i blocked her number again.

i texted and called my son numerous times, and left a voicemail telling him that we needed to talk, but first he had to come clean to his girlfriend and accept responsibility for his actions. he didn't respond, so i called her myself. we chatted for a while and she told me he was out with a friend. i asked if he had spoken to her about anything recently, and she said no. so i told her myself. mostly because i felt it was the right thing to do, as she was a victim in this too, but i'll admit partially because he's a grown man now and needs to deal with the consequences. he showed up to my place that evening, and i let him in. i'm ashamed to say i wasn't nearly as calm as i hoped i'd be. he asked if ruining his relationship made me feel better, and i told him that he ruined it. pretty much any hope of productive conversation went out the window and it became a screaming match, at which point i told him to get out and figure out how to deal with being as alone as i was. he slapped me in the head. this is a kid who never even threw a toy out of anger in childhood, who wasn't even spanked. as disgusting and twisted as it is, this exploded into a physical fight with me being struck in the face multiple times while trying to restrain him as i didn't have it in me to hit him, my son very much not being a fighter while in my younger years i very much was, until i took him off his feet and held him to the floor. i've never felt that level of rage before, how incredibly overwhelming it was.

when i seen the fear on his face i let him up and sat beside him on the floor. i told him to get out. he started crying and told me that his mother would be ashamed of him. this made me break down, pathetically so, and realize how fucked up this while thing has been. i agreed that she'd be ashamed of both of us, and we hugged while he cried into my chest, something he hasn't done since my wife passed. he asked if it was too late to talk, and i told him it wasn't. i cleaned myself up, we sat at the kitchen table and talked. he told me that he'd stopped therapy a while ago and lied about it, because he felt it wasn't helping. he told me that he was hurt when i kept my girlfriend from him the first year, because although he knew it was to prevent him getting attached if it didn't work out, he still felt excluded. it came out that he hid a very well concealed alcohol problem from me, and even his girlfriend. he told me he didn't sleep with her to spite me, that he was just feeling lost and he made a stupid choice. i asked him why he couldn't have been honest with me before it came to this, and he told me he didn't feel like he could be honest with himself anymore. 

we cried together again, prayed together despite neither of us being religious, looked through family photo albums together. we discussed the road forward, and we agreed that the loss we both felt went far deeper than we thought. we decided on attending therapy together, we're going to look into support groups both for his drinking and other families dealing with loss, and now that he's without his girlfriend and i'm aware of the extent of his issues, i agreed to let him move back home with me so i can make sure he attends his appointments and avoids alcohol, and hopefully so we can bond again with the stipulation that any more violence and he's out the door.

he asked me if i can ever forgive him, and i told him honestly that i couldn't, but he's still my son and i love him. and i reminded him of what his mother told him when he was a kid, that everyone messes up, it's what you do afterwards that makes the difference. i'll never forgive what he did, but if he learns from this and becomes a better person then i can forget it and have a great relationship with him regardless.

aside from the fact my lip resembles the mouth of the vampires from blade 2 for now which has prompted concern from neighbors and friends, the past two days have been great. we've been talking, we cooked dinner together, we've gone on walks and we're set to start looking into professional help this coming week. he's incredibly apologetic and has a tenderness i haven't seen from him in years. i have no illusions about the amount of work to be done nor how serious this incident was, but i'm feeling very optimistic about the future.

**tl;dr** ex is out of my life for good. son was left by his girlfriend, which led to a physical confrontation and an outpouring of honesty. the road ahead looks like it'll be long and full of hurdles, but we both seem committed to each other and getting through it together.",7
"got terminated after telling boss i'm pregnant. i've been working at this company for a year and a half and have had no negative feedback or commentary about my work. i had about 3 major projects and 2 smaller projects going on as of november 2018. around december, stating there's not enough work for everyone, my boss took one of my major projects and one of my smaller projects and gave them to other team members in similar positions as me. i was ok with this, as i figured if others don't have workload it is ok to distribute it evenly. as of yesterday, i still had one major project closing out (deficiency work in progress), one major project active until at least june, and one smaller project until at least march. i was busy.

&#x200b;

in the middle of january, i found out i was pregnant. i've been dealing with strong bouts of morning sickness and decided to tell my boss on feb 8th that i am pregnant via a formal letter and email - after my first ultrasound & prenatal confirmation (feb 6th and 7th respectively - i was about 8 weeks).

after having very little communication with me during this period, he decided to terminate my employment yesterday, 12 days after finding out i'm pregnant. the reason he stated is that ""there is not enough work"" and business ""economical decisions"". however, none of the other team members in similar positions have been given reduced work, hours, or terminations. i am the only one affected.

i was also not offered any other opportunity for reduced work hours, work loads, or even an opportunity for early mat leave which i would've definitely considered if it meant maintaining somewhat steady employment during this time.

&#x200b;

i am currently taking anti-nausea medication (that i have to remain on for the duration of pregnancy) and pregnancy-triggered asthma medication along with having some gum/teeth bleeding issues that are also symptoms from pregnancy. i had booked a dental appointment on march 9th for this issue. after this termination i've lost my health insurance (husband is self-employed and was on my insurance). i've been only given one week of insurance coverage which does not even cover the end of the month.

&#x200b;

i am wondering what my legal rights are in this situation.

&#x200b;

p.s. i haven't taken any time away from work due to my symptoms. we have the opportunity to work remotely from site or home if need be and i have followed through every single day, even if i was bedridden, with all of my work emails and tasks for the day. i have informed my manager of every appointment (there were only 3) and taken time off either during lunch breaks or scheduled it accordingly to not affect my work schedule. tuesday this week was my first sick day since december 2017, when i took two sick days.

&#x200b;

edit: i just wanted to add on a bit more info on the ""transfer of job"" situation that occurred that one commenter had asked whether it was a common practice?  
and the answer is pretty frequently actually, this is why i didn't think anything of it. my major project that is closing out/deficiency phase began before i started employment and was under a coworker with the same role as me and was passed on to me. same coworker had another job which started last year, they were on it for 2 months early last year, then it was passed on to me for the rest of it. one of my initial smaller jobs i did with this company had 3 parts, i did finishing of part 1 and entirety of part 2, and part 3 was passed on to another coworker. this was done all the time based often on location of the sites (who can conveniently drive there) or person's availability or who knows what else. 

it never occurred to us anything that would spell ""role reduction"" and my former coworker confirmed this also as we had this discussion before.",2
"why can't i weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?. please read this before answering

this is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. gravity pulls two objects with mass together. the force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. the force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

but newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. it seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

so is force really mass x acceleration? where is this discontinuity coming from?

&#x200b;

so, after that post things got, interesting to say the least.  a lawyer from my insurance company got into contact with me and asked me a bunch of question and told me a little of what's going on. turns out that ""doctor"" dave was already being investigated by my insurance company for fraudulent charges and that i wasn't the only one who went in for a ""free"" consultation and adjustment and been charged. the lawyer told me that i probably won't need to do anything else as they were handling it and to stay as far away from the ""doctor"" as possible.

&#x200b;

if this was the end of it i wouldn't have even come back. here i am so something happened. and boy, was it satisfying. i submitted complaints to the board that licenses chiropractors and physical therapists after my last post. along with a harsh email to the company the pt was working for. well, this last friday i got a email from said company apologizing. they said that the pt who refereed me to him is ""no longer with us"" and ""will not be practicing in the near future"". along with this, on ""doctor"" dave's facebook page they released a statement saying that they will not be taking new patients for the foreseeable future

so, it seems that, for the time being, these two won't be pulled the shit they had with me. a win-win.

"i left some volatile gummy bears on the desk now my co-worker wants to sue me. this is in michigan. i am originally from germany and very unsure how the law works in the united states so bear with me. 

last year i received a job offer to work as an assistant professor in the german language department at a large university in michigan. i recently finished my phd and was really excited to fill a research position (and possible post doc position) in the specific field i applied to. 




most of my time i give classes in german literature but additionally the university would like me to help students with writer's block so i joined an interdisciplinary workshop. 

there are at least 4 people connected to this workshop and we get along fine most of the time. sadly there is one elderly woman who made me out as a rival day one. 

i do not know what provoked her but there is something about me that makes her mad.  cue the incident...i had an appointment with a student, gave him some tips and instructions and left my bowl with gummy bears on the desk. 

mind you, these gummy bears a sugar free and volatile, if you eat more than a handful you are in serious fart troubles and you will occupy the toilet bowl for the rest of your day.

but my co-worker ate the whole bowl, first she excused herself from any commitments and then she called in sick. the next day she confronted me and blamed me for the whole ordeal, that i deliberately placed those gummy bears and it was all a ploy to humiliate her. 

according to her she has already informed hr and her lawyer and that i will be kicked out of the country in no time. the only thing i can blame myself on is that me and my colleagues giggled at her bowel distress signals.

"help protect your grandparents from scammers by saying your name when they answer the phone.. a common scam people try to pull on the elderly is to call them and say something like ""hi grandma, i'm stuck and i need money to get home.""  often the victim will say ""oh is this jake?  where are you?"" after hearing a name the scammer will assume that identity ""yes, this is jake, my car broke down in another province and i need you to transfer me money to get it repaired so i can come home.""  

the problem here is the victim asked who was on the other end of the phone.  when calling your grandparents, when they pick up the phone you say ""hi grandma, it's jake.""  
that way they know that if one day someone calls asking for money, they not only know not to ask who it is by giving a name.  but they also know that if the person does say it's you that that couldn't be true because you always give your name when you call.


i started doing this with my grandmother after she told me she got a call one time just like the one i described above.  someone called and said they were in jail and needed money for bail.  she said ""oh, is this jake?"" and the scammer said ""yes it is.""  they insisted she didn't need  to come  to the police station but that they definitely needed the money.  she went to the bank to make the withdrawal and the excellent tellers realized it was a scam and stopped her.  
since then i told her i would always give my name when i call and have been doing so for years.

well, it's been about three weeks since my post and my breakup. and it took almost that full time to let it sink in what i've really done. i self wallowed for some time and attempted to guilt trip her and get my siblings to talk to her for me. what a mistake that was. she called and ripped me a new one worse than you guys did. she told me that she was thrilled we're not together and that i'm manipulative and ""disgusting."" that left me really shocked and i had to review my behavior over the time we had been together. i think over my life i always had an idea that with enough perseverance anyone's mind can be changed. i don't know where i got this from. i guess i thought it was a sign of being a strong person. like taking what you want from life even when the chances are slim. it sounds stupid because it is. i reread my post just now and cringed the whole way through. even the language i used showed that she was right and i am manipulative. she's a human being and i didn't treat her with respect. i played with our relationship to get her to change her mind about something very important to her. i deserve what happened. i also have realized that our views on the relationship were a little different. she had never brought up marriage or anything while it had crossed my mind almost daily because i really was so enamored. so i probably looked insane going on about having three children. it sounds so stupid to me now. among the things she said on the phone, one was that she found my lack of respect for her body and choices appalling. i wasn't asking her to be forgiven, but i wanted to express how much her and her son meant to me. and as most dumped people tend to do, i couldn't even give a shit about what i was bitching about in the first place. i miss going to the park with her and her son. those days were nice and calm and i didn't appreciate them. i let some fictional children and my bad habits ruin something good. i have a lot of self reflecting to do, and while i'm still sad, i know now that her dumping me was really for the best. thanks guys for being honest.

is he even able to do that? i feel like i shouldn't have to pay more seeing that he had my car for so long.

thanks!

update: went to go check out the car. waited 30 min for him to put the intake and oil in which he said he had already did the night before. he started the car and it just blew a ton of burning oil smoke and made an even worse clicking noise than it did before i even brought it to him. 

his excuse was that he ""didn't hear that before"" so he didn't know it was a problem. he then said that he would replace the engine for free as long as i gave him the $300 and brought him a new engine.

i talked with a cop as well and he said there wasn't much i could do since he hasn't actually stolen it yet.

"i walked in on a rape. excuse the title, i didn't know what else to start with. this has been on my mind heavily for the past 2 years or so.

for some background this occurred when i was 26, at my own apartment that i shared with four roommates.

my roommate m went out with his friend c to a few clubs and bars. c was nice enough but he was into early 30s and still had the frat boy attitude and there was always something about him that i didn't like. i didn't feel unsafe around him or anything its just he was ""off"" a bit, he became too friendly too fast.

m and c returned at about 2am. i'd been watching netflix and heard them come in so i came out to say hi. m and c had brought back two ladies. i politely said hello, shook their hands and made small talk. after about 5 minutes m and his ""date"" went back to his room to hook up. c and his ""date"" stayed in the living room as every other bedroom was off limits.

i went and refilled my glass of water that was by my nightstand. i don't know why i forgot it on my way back to my room. but i did. 5 minutes after returning to my room i realized i'd forgotten my glass of water.

i stepped out of my room and diagonally across from me on a loveseat was a c, he was trying to take this girl's shirt off. she was trying to push it back down. she locked eyes with me, and c snapped and turned toward me, yelling ""dude, just fuck off!!"" i didn't say anything i just looked him dead in the eye. he got up and sat on the other couch sulking like a child that had just had a toy taken away. the girl rushed to the other side of the room and zipped her coat back up.

during this twenty second ordeal this girl's coat, pants, boots, sweater and t-shirt stayed on. there is no doubt in my mind what would've happened if i'd not walked out then.

i never told m because not only was c one of his closest friends but i don't think he'd believe it. i told one of my other roommates, who told me to just forget about and not worry because it wasn't my business. what worries me is that c was sober enough to know what he was doing, and that he tried this shit at another person's apartment. i don't want to think about any of the girls he's brought to his apartment in the past, or will in the future.

i offered to call the police, she declined saying that she didn't want to be a bother, and that it'd just inconvenience everyone.

you're probably wondering why i've never told the police. well honestly, unless they find that girl and she presses charges they'd have no case beyond what she and i would say. now that years have passed every other shred of potential evidence is gone.

i spoke to my mom who's a psychiatric nurse specializing in treating sexual abuse victims who told me that was absolutely the beginning of a rape. i told a friend who's a former cop and he agreed to.

i'm not the kind of person who immediately believes an accusation, but i know what i saw. i didn't just walk in on a rape, i walked in on every woman's worst nightmare.",11
"i have a year clean from heroin today.. it just feels like a regular day, honestly. i didn't want to use yesterday, or the day before. i don't want to use today. that dark chapter of my life is over, and i'm incredibly grateful for that.

it's also my mom's birthday today. i couldn't have done it without her, either. i hope she likes the fancy alexa we got her. it's got like, a display screen that shows you the weather and stuff? i dunno, it looks neat. she asked for the most basic version, but she definitely deserves the nicest one, so that's the one she's getting.

like i said, it's just another day, really. i'm gonna do boring stuff like go to the gym and get my car's oil changed. the difference between yesterday and today is pretty much imperceptible. but somewhere in the last year, i've started becoming a pretty different person. the kind of person i actually like, maybe. it's still a work in progress. i guess it always should be, though, shouldn't it?

anyway, these are just some thoughts i wanted to put down. i could say more, but the take-away is that i'm just grateful. i could be dead right now. it's a wonder that i'm not. and though i'm not perfectly happy with my life, i am so thankful i didn't die. i'm so thankful for the people i've had in my life that have helped me to keep living and be a better person than i've been.

"i (31m) am sterile. fiance (27f) miraculously got pregnant. baby looks nothing like me. how do i address this?. we had been trying to have a baby for a few years. eventually we found out i was sterile. we accepted it and decided to hold off on trying so hard and said that we would figure out what i do in the future. although we weren't trying, we were continuing to have sex obviously. one day she missed her period and we found out he was pregnant. i was so happy and i thought it was amazing. we joked about how as soon as we stopped trying she ends up pregnant. the doctor said that it was a miracle baby. 

the night that the baby was born i couldn't be happier. i was just happy to finally have a baby and so excited to take her home. after a few days of taking care of her, i couldn't help but notice that she was extremely pale. for reference, i am black and she is white. i figure she would eventually darken a little and i didn't want to overthink it. 

then our friends came over and while the girls were inside we were outback drinking. they all mentioned that they didn't want to worry me or to cause drama but asked if i ever thought my fiance would cheat on me. i thought i was very weird and then i knew exactly where they were going with it. i said no and we talked about our concerns with the babies skin tone. however i still tried to brush it off thinking that the baby would get darker after a while. 

now the baby is 5 months and i can't help but question if she's mine everyday. she has very fine hair. no kinks or curls, just bone straight hair. i know she's a baby but i have been around plenty of babies who still have natural curls. she is also still very pale. the thing that's been bothering me the most is that everyday she looks more and more asian in the eyes. i don't mean to offend anyone at all but her eyes are just very stretched, they look nothing like mine. 

is it wrong for me to be questioning my fiance when this would have never crossed my mind before? am i just being paranoid? how do i go about addressing this? do i even say anything? my biggest fear is that the baby is somehow mine and she will be extremely hurt that i accused her of sleeping with someone else. i just don't know what to do. please help me.

"for blasting my horn at a person using their phone whilst driving?. this happened about 30 minutes ago.

she was on her phone, holding it by her head with her elbow resting on the open window, speaking into it. i blasted my horn at her, a slight bit of road rage sure, but this startled her and caused her to drop her phone out the car window. 

i don't know what happened after that, but it's a busy roundabout so i doubt she was able to retrieve it before it was smashed into a million pieces. the person i was driving with blasted me, saying i shouldn't have done that and i was an asshole for causing the destruction of what was presumably an expensive phone. i disagree, play stupid games win stupid prizes and all that. but, my friend is insistent that i was an asshole.

we had a lot in common, a love of star wars, books, music, comics, fart jokes, trivia, beer, and having a good time. i will still enjoy those things and all the things we would do together, but it will all be tinged with a little bit of sadness from now on. 
we were very different.  people that knew us independently would never imagine that we were as close as we were. he liked guinness,  i like pbr. he was yoda all the way, i am vader. 
but none of our differences mattered when we were together, because he was my best fucking friend that i will ever have, and i would give anything to be able to call him up and when he answered shout homosexual and hear him laugh every time and he answer brother. 
fun won't be quite as much fun, beer won't taste quite as good, metal music won't be as loud, and yoda will shrink a little without him, and i will carry this until i die.
i don't have a confession,  no dark secrets that some of you were hoping for. just some advice, take care of yourselves. listen to your bodies and what they tell you. 
and tell your friends, your real, hide a body friends, what they are to you and how much they mean to you.
now, my old, worn out, fat ass is going to cry alone again because the shoulder that i used to cry on is gone, and i fucking hate it.
good luck to you all and watch our for yourselves and each other.",12
"as a woman i'm glad america hasn't had a female president yet, as the one woman who got closest to obtaining that position would have made us all look bad. like if someone is going to be 'the first' at something, you want that person to be among the best and brightest of their group. i feel that in 2008, barack was among the finest men of his background they could have voted for. in 2016, women didn't exactly have their finest representative on the ballot, far from in it fact. so it's good she lost. the first woman president should be a woman of perfect reputation. someone who isn't shady or corrupt in any way, without any sketchy foundations backing her and foreign interests paying for her campaign.

"got a text from a former coworker saying our old boss has been opening credit cards in employees' names for the last couple of years. old boss was arrested and fled the country.. i worked for a 25-30 person consulting service for three years until the start of 2018. the employee who texted me about it said she had just quit about three months ago and she got a notification a credit card had been opened in her name. they were able to trace it to our old boss (she had quit about a month before the card was opened) and supposedly he has done this to multiple former employees. last summer, i had a credit card opened in my name but the credit card company agreed to not try to collect on it. what can i do know that i know (or have a really good idea) who did it?

"update: my 25m wife 25f has 1000 matches on tinder. we are high school sweethearts.. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/byt7xr/my_25m_wife_25f_has_1000_matches_on_tinder_we_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

i finally worked up the balls to confront my wife over this three days ago, on sunday. we went out to brunch, and after, i told her straight up that i saw a tinder notification.

she told me that she uses it as a confidence boaster, something not so surprising. she then opened her profile and showed that she hadn't talked to any of the guys she matched with; i scrolled around for a bit, something she let me do, and found that she was telling the truth. there were only incoming messages, no outgoing. 

i told her that that made me very uncomfortable, and that i still loved her very much and that she shouldn't be unconfident. she said that she was insecure about her pregnancy body, she didn't think i was attracted to her anymore, she had nagging thoughts that i was having an affair (not true at all), and that she would never see another man. 

i asked her to delete it, and she did instantly. she told me that, if i was still paranoid, i had every right to snoop on her phone from time to time without permission. i told her i had no intention of doing that (i dont) because i don't want to be ""that husband.""

we're off to couples therapy, but i think we'll be alright. i just hope she gets her confidence back soon; she has no reason to be insecure.

tl;dr wife insecure as i expected, used tinder as a confidence booster. proved it, now off to couples therapy.",7

"i want to give my (29f) live-in, introverted boyfriend (33m) a fun ""staycation"" without me. if this would be better posted elsewhere, then sorry mods and please let me know, but i think this falls under relationship advice?

my boyfriend and i live together - we don't have a tv, but i know he loves video games, especially the first person shooter kind. he has mentioned missing video games in passing, but we don't want all of the stuff in our tiny apartment on a regular basis.

i'm going away for 5 days, and i've secretly rented a tv, playstation, and a couple games. i'm going to set them up on the day of my departure right after he leaves for work, so he'll come home from work and realize that he has a temporary man cave for almost a week.  he knows i'm leaving, of course, but he hasn't made any plans, so i'm pretty sure he just wants to give his brain a break from his stressful job by reading at home. (note - he has previously stated video games are also relaxing)

how can i make these 5 days even better for him, gamers? the video games will make him happy, but i love this guy and i want to go all out. or as much as i can on a limited budget, anyways. i'm going to leave a care basket on the couch with comfy, new pajamas, a bottle of whiskey, his favorite snacks, a love note, and beer in the fridge. i was thinking of setting up some sort of pizza delivery for the first night as well?

any suggestions or advice? 

edit: wow! i woke up and found out that the internet rose to the occasion! thank you kind strangers, for all your advice and my very first ever reddit gold. i am so touched by all of these kind comments, and i appreciate all of your help! i've never had a bigger smile on my face first thing in the morning. 

here are some of my takeaways so far, but i'll still be combing through all your comments since there are so many gems:

- i won't go too overboard and focus on quality instead of the quantity of things i can do for him
- luckily, he's already mentioned some of his favorite games, so i've taken note, and i'm going to the store tomorrow to get those. i've rented a ps3 (they didn't have a ps$ available, alas) and i'm working on securing an xbox one as well
- part of the package will be him trashing the place, and me happily cleaning it up when i get back.
- i'll make sure all the games are installed in advance (thanks guys, i would have never thought about this)
- i think i'll just leave him an ubereats gift certifcate in addition to making some home-baked goodies instead of trying to coordinate pizza delivery
- i'll include some sexy talk in the note i leave him, telling him allllllll the things we're going to do when i get back
- i'll hook it all up to the internet so he can play multiplayer if he wants
- i've rented the gaming consoles for an additional day so he and i can play together when he gets back. i don't really play video games, so i'm just gonna get my butt whupped over and over again. any gamer tips will be highly appreciated. ",7

"girlfriend 22feels less sexually attracted to me because i'm overweight and she asked why i couldn't look more like ""x"" in tv show's.. **thank you all for commenting, but due work i have hard time responding back to all.  i am working out and i will talk to her. but after this i think slowly her reality of boyfriend or life is getting out of hands with all that tv shows and all those movies she watches i also see people here are saying my bf is off, but this is just what the personal trainer messured me at.  i've lifted weights since 2011.  i would post pic but not yet while this is going on.**

hello all, i'm a bit overweight forgot my age. i'm 25. male. i'm 21%bf going down, 106kg (233lbs) . and 1.77m  tall.  i used to be 18% and 101kg (222lbs) when i met her. but over the 3year course of our relationship i've gained weight.   i went to 25% bodyfat because i stopped working out. now i'm lifting again and gone back down to 21%bf (just got messured)  

she is around 1.63m tall and 89-91kg (198-200lbs,) last time i knew which was 4 months back she was 91kg (200lbs)  she doesn't train anything she used to swim when i met her and back then she was 75kg (165lbs) 

so you all see we both have gained a bit fat. but i'm working on cutting but i got problem with binge eating at evening.  we do not live together but i know she has been watching tv show that involes many shirtless guys, of course all with abs.  and yesterday i was at her place, watching this tv show with her. i tried to escalate, she said she didn't want to.  i said *oh okei*  then all of sudden she asks. *why can't you have six pack?*  i told her i was working on it (for myself not her) and she said she doesn't feel as much sexually attracted to me because i'm fat.  i couldn't say a word i just awkwardly laughed.   then 20 min later i decided to go home.

she wasn't joking she was dead serious. ever since she started watching tv shows like this our sex has decreased.  

i almost broke up with her because i feel like she doesnt deserve me when i loose my weight, she isn't doing anything about her weight. is this acceptable off her?

"the love of my life left for vacation and returned engaged to someone who ""identifies as a vampire"". of course i've shed countless tears over this, but i'd be lying if i said i didn't get a few laughs out of the pure absurdity of this situation.

when this happened, i had been dating my boyfriend, whom i will refer to as adam, for three years, and we'd been living together for a year and a half. this relationship had been incredible. we met in college and have many of the same interests. we have so much fun together and he's ridiculously sweet. i mean, i really, really loved this guy. i am head over heels for him, and people are always telling me that he is for me, too. well, they used to. 

adam decided to go on a trip to a city across the country for his friend's wedding. i was invited, but couldn't come because i couldn't get work off.

everything was totally fine before him leaving. we had a lovely night having a picnic and skinny dipping in a lake before he left. 

adam's texts became increasingly terse, and then, 6 days later, when he was supposed to come home, he began making weird excuses as to why he needed to extend the trip.

his texts became further and further between until i finally just asked what was up. he told me he had met someone else. i was shocked and obviously crushed.

a few days later, i see on facebook that adam is engaged. after less than two weeks. i look to see who he's engaged to, and...

it's a person with a gender-neutral name from middle english that kind of sounds like something that would be out of twilight or something. i'm not creative, so i guess the fake name i'll give this person is ""batty"". trust me, it was that ridiculous.

batty's profile said vhey went by the pronouns ""vey/vem"" because vhey ""have been identifying as a vamp since 2016"". i didn't ask, but judging by the gender-neutral name and appearance, i think this is a non-binary vampire.

i'm going to be honest, i began to suspect this vampire person was holding adam hostage or something. maybe i just didn't want to face rejection, but it was so goddamned out of the blue and out of character. 

adam did eventually come back to say goodbye and pack his things before moving back to be with batty. i met up with him and asked him wtf was going on, and yes to be honest i was sort of like ""did you get kidnapped? do you need me to call the police?"" 

adam was apologetic but told me he just immediately fell in love with batty. that ve was so brilliant and had this beautiful soul and he knew they were soulmates.

so.....yep. can't wait to see pictures of the wedding, i wonder if there will be coffins and bats.",11

"final update: toronto - landlord let cleaners into my condo without consent. $1,700 worth of property stolen. what's up /r/legaldvice? i have received some messages from people asking about how this ended, so i'm back with my final update on this thing. you may recall my last two threads:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4cnlz7/toronto_landlord_let_cleaners_into_my_condo/
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4cse80/update_toronto_landlord_let_cleaners_into_my/ 

this is going to be long. there's  a tl;dr at the end.

after those threads, i felt like i was probably correct in pursuing the landlord, but the comments were a bit of a mixed bag of advice. as i said i would, i sought council here in town. i saw a paralegal that was supposedly in this area of law, referred through the law society. what an enormous waste of time.

after i explained the entire situation to the paralegal and how i didn't know if i should go after the property manager at the tenant board, or the cleaner in small claims, or both in small claims; the guy basically despondently nodded and said, ""yeah… that's a real tough one… what do you want to do?""

it was frustrating that a legal professional in toronto couldn't give me any better direction than reddit. i left no wiser than i arrived, and decided to just go through the process with the ltb and feel it out. it didn't feel worth my time or money to seek additional council.

there was a preliminary hearing at the ltb in april where the property manager and i were each allowed to give our version of events, attempt mediation, and then the board member would determine if the case would go to a formal hearing. after telling my side of things, the property manager didn't dispute any of the events. the board member said that the cleaner was an agent of the landlord, and advised the property manager they would be required to pay any damages to me that may be awarded. this was very good to hear, as it finally confirmed i was correct to go after the property manager and not the cleaner.

the property manager was cooperative and was pleasant enough to deal with. the board member asked us if we would attempt a settlement. so far, the cleaner had offered $600. the pm said they would add $400 to that for a total of $1,000. i said i would not take less than the full value of my items listed, because i was confident i could prove their value beyond what they offered at a hearing. no settlement was agreed on. that was unsurprising and made sense to me. even though the pm was not contesting the events and was likely going to be ruled against in a formal hearing, it was in their interest to make me prove the value of my stuff and get an order from the board for that amount. then they could use the order to sue the cleaner later. if they settled it could be difficult to get the money from the cleaner.

at the end of the preliminary hearing, the board member took down a ""statement of agreed facts"" to expedite our next hearing, since we didn't disagree on any of it. i'm not going to list them, but the gist of it is that they gave their copy of the key to my apartment to a third party without my consent and they removed my belongings from my apartment. it was very clear they weren't fighting me on that.

the formal public hearing where the board would determine damages was a couple months later. i had receipts (mostly paypal confirmation emails) for about $1,200 worth of my things that were taken. then i had $400 worth of stuff where i had pictures of me wearing it with identifying brand markings and stuff showing, with print outs from web sites where it could be purchased to show the monetary value. then about $200 worth of stuff where all i had was pictures because they were irreplaceable items that i paid cash for. i had my girlfriend as a witness to what was taken and to confirm brands of clothing items. the full value of the items was over $1,800.

i was expecting to be awarded $1,200 at least for the items i could prove exactly how much i paid for, which is why i didn't settle for $1,000, but wasn't confident about the rest of it. 

before the hearings for the day started, the board member called out our names and said ""are you sure you can't settle this one with the mediator this morning? i'm looking at the agreed facts here and…"" he looked over at the landlord and kind of shrugged as if to say the hearing is a formality at this point. nonetheless, the landlord wouldn't budge on it, so we waited 4 hours until we were called up for our hearing.

after we went through all of the documents item-by-item, the property manager was given the floor. he tried to dispute the items that did not have receipts – specifically a pair of jeans worth over $300 (yes, seriously.) the board member said that it's not a criminal case, and it's not up to me to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every single item i listed (referenced *maldonado v. m.e.i.,* 1980). the burden of proof i had to meet for a civil matter like this was met through what i had provided. as the pm elected not to bring any experts, witnesses, etc. that could argue against the values i had stated, or to say the items i was wearing in the pictures did not match the products in the evidence i produced, he had no reason not to believe me. the board member said he did not even want to hear from my witness, because the evidence i produced was substantial, and there was no contest from the property manager beyond ""it's not a receipt"".

the board member ruled in my favour for the full amount that we discussed for each item at the hearing, and i received the order stating such a week or so later in the mail. on my way out of the hearing i asked the landlord what they were going to do. he said they had no interest in fighting it and would be getting the cleaner to pay for it.

a week or two later i received the cheque in the mail, from the cleaner. this was a few months ago now, the cheque cleared and the matter is resolved.

thanks to everyone that offered their advice and comments in the other threads.

**tl;dr:**  had a hearing at the tenant board and won. i didn't have receipts for everything but the board member ruled that it's not a criminal case and i didn't have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt what the value of my belongings were. i provided enough evidence combined with the fact that it was uncontested by the landlord, so i was awarded the full replacement cost of everything i lost - over $1800.

"for telling her to ""know her place""?. throwaway account cause several friends know my main account.

&#x200b;

i (f27) have been friends with a guy; steve since i was 12. there is a group of us - and key point is that i am the only girl. i don't really know 'why' i'm the girl of the group; but i am. outside of my recent ex; tom, of 3 years, i have never once liked or been liked by any of these guys. i am not a ""pretty"" girl, and i describe my taste in clothes as 'meh'. i'm not fashion savvy or makeup savvy, etc. let me say this again - steve and i have never touched beyond hugging. the most intimate we've gotten was probably him carrying me home when i broke my foot once.

&#x200b;

about 4 months ago, tom and i broke up, and at the same time steve began dating this girl abby. abby is beautiful and knows all the things that i wish i knew about being a woman. so, upon meeting her, i was warm, friendly and was even asking for fashion advice when i met her. i wanted to be her friend. abby was quiet, and not as warm, but i put that down to shyness.

&#x200b;

last night steve, abby, tom, myself and a few others went out for dinner and drinks. i continued being friendly to abby, while not really having a response to that. i went to the bathroom and when i came out of the stall abby was standing there waiting for me.

&#x200b;

i'll cut a giant argument short, but abby accused me of breaking up with tom to get with steve and told me that she will do whatever she has to do to get rid of me, stating that it was ""super weird"" that i was the only girl friends with a group of guys, insinuating that i'd slept with all of them, but then also implying that i should have left the group when tom and i broke up. my response to this was to tell abby to 'know' her place and that i had been around for much longer than her, and that if anyone was going to be ""gotten rid of"" it'd be her because we had been through the jealous girlfriend situation before and steve had chosen me, and would never seriously consider a girl that hated his best friend.

&#x200b;

abby went out and told steve i attacked her - who didn't believe a word and broke up with her on the spot. since then, i've gotten messages from abby's friends on social media to tell me what a whore, bitch, slut, i am and that steve and i were fucking the whole time. one girl even sent these messages to my family to 'warn' me about what kind of 'slut' i am. my own brother says he feels that i've caused this drama myself by

extra info as required:

holy shit - didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. and i did not expect gold at all - so thanks? 

&#x200b;

unfortunately i did mean 27 in the post - i failed to mention that abby is actually 22; but i do highly accept that i could have handled the situation much better; i am not a confrontational person. i grew up in an abusive home (in particular from my step-mother and step-sister) and my general response to conflict is tears (which i hate) or just bolting and ghosting a situation. i think being ambushed is why i lost my cool. 

&#x200b;

i read a lot of comments about how this came off as ""not like other girls"". i don't know how to not make it do so. i'm simply not ""good"" at being friends with other girls. i'm shy, awkward, i stumble over my words; and because i \*want\* to be friends with them, it comes off as desperate and overdone. i do have girl acquaintances but it never goes beyond the occasional coffee time. 

&#x200b;

boundaries - i'm not a touchy-feely person outside of if i'm actually in a relationship or seeking a relationship with someone. again - childhood abuse. once we got out of high school and stopped seeing each other as frequently - we do a quick side hug goodbye. 3 of the other guys have girlfriends who all seem to enjoy my company when we are together. 

&#x200b;

somebody mentioned that i'm obviously into my friends if i got with tom. tom and i kissed as a joke once, sensed the chemistry and things went from there. we all thought it was going to be forever - but tom got some bad health news and put ""us"" on hold until/unless it ends positively. he doesn't want to put me through that. 

&#x200b;

the long version of the argument began with abby asking why i was wearing such an inappropriate outfit for someone who'd just broken up with someone (jeans, boots and a shirt); i stared at her in shock and said ""what the fuck - what's going on?"" and then she straight away started with the accusations. 

&#x200b;

as a last note - the previous girlfriend of steve's happened when we were about 16; and when that happened, i stepped back completely and began distancing myself from everyone. it was about 2 weeks before tom of all people got it out of me and he went to steve and told him. i offered to leave the friendship and not make their lives a burden or whatever the words i said were, and they all said ""no, she's in the wrong"" and that any girlfriend who couldn't/wouldn't understand i was a friend/sister was not the girl they wanted to spend time with. this was repeated to me this morning when i showed the messages i was getting from abby and her friends. i was apologising profusely (and for my part in the argument - telling her to 'know her place' which was such bad wording on my part - i know) and was told by steve ""well she obviously wasn't wife material then"". being friends with these guys for so long and that i should have stuck with girls instead, or ended the friendships once we all started dating in high school. he also feels that i'm leading on any man i'm with by having male friends who they then have to question constantly if i have or am sleeping with. so - aita?",3

"how to meal plan like a champ. my meal planning and grocery shopping habits are something i really pride myself on. over the last 3 years, i've worked really hard to maximize efficiency in this area, therefore saving me a lot of time and money. i thought i would share my process and tips to help anyone out who might be struggling in this area. please feel free to share any additional tricks you have!


**get started.**

take a look at your bank account history and add up all the money you spend on food each month. factor in your grocery expenses, fast food, coffee, snacks from the gas station, etc. find the average and use that as a point of comparison for how much you spend while meal planning. this part isn't mandatory but i find it really neat to compare. commit to 1 month of meal planning. your comparison results will be skewed if you go off track.


**meal planning**

1. first you need to think about how all the parts of you life, habits, and preferences should factor into your plan. how many people do you need to feed? how many nights do you want to cook? how long will you realistically eat leftovers for? do you have an obligation one evening that could affect your plan? it's really important to think about all of these things and seriously consider your family's habits. for example, i won't eat leftovers twice. if i plan for that, i always end up going off track because 3 day old food is just not appealing to me. also, i don't feel like cooking a big meal every night, so i build in an ""easy"" meal that i can make with my toddler that doesn't take a lot of time (think grilled cheese and tomato soup). i also enjoy spending sundays preparing a big meal, so i know that will influence which recipes i choose for the week.

2. choose your recipes. it's important to read the instructions and ingredients before adding them to your list. there is nothing more frustrating than getting home ready to make your meal, and realizing it should have been marinated overnight. also, if you see an ingredient you are not familiar with, check google for substitutes. that way if you get to the store and they don't carry it, you already have an alternative in mind. this happens often with health foods which might only be carried at specialty stores. if you're trying to save money, consider which ingredients (such as meat) will be more costly. **bonus:** if you can find recipes that use the same ingredients, this will save you money. 

3. figure out which recipes will be made which night. i personally plan my healthier meals at the beginning of the week because i'm more motivated. by friday, i might want some comfort food to take a load off the stress of the week. there is some flexibility to switch around meals by night, but i like to space out my meals so that i'm not eating similar things two nights in a row. if you plan to eat out, be honest with yourself and add it in your plan/budget. don't plan 7 nights of  cooking if you can't stick to it. if you plan a meal and eat out instead, you're wasting money and food. i personally plan 4 nights of real meals, 1 easy night, 1 ""fend for yourself night"" and 1 night of eating out. 

4. plan your lunch. some people meal-prep lunches at night, but i find that takes way too long. i also don't want to meal prep 5 lunches on sunday that i am sick of by wednesday. i always make enough dinner to have left overs for both my husband and i for lunch and plan one free day to buy lunch. i would recommend this to anyone on a budget.  

5. plan your breakfast. the costs of coffee and breakfast sandwiches really add up. a quick, healthy breakfast is not hard to plan. i normally do oatmeal, fruit, eggs or english muffins. i pick one of those things and eat them all week. i will switch it up the following week. each of these are good for a ""grab n go"" breakfast. 


**make your grocery list**

1. throughout the week, keep a sticky note on your fridge. every time you run out of something, write it on the list.

2. make a list of all the ingredients from each recipe.

3. take inventory. anything on your list that's already in your pantry you can cross off. if you notice your low on a staple, add it to your list. don't forget to consider non-food essentials (toilet paper, cleaning supplies, toiletries, etc)

4. add all items from your collected list from the past week. 

5. share your list with family/roommates. they can tell if you if there is something you are forgetting or if they have a request. 

6. now re-organize your list by department. this is important. it will help you move through the grocery store more efficiently without having to go back for something you missed. i separate mine by: dry, frozen, non-food, dairy, bakery, meat, and produce. 


**get to the store**

1. don't forget to grab your coupons!

2. at the store, stay focused! if it's not on your list, don't buy it. period. impulse shopping is no good.

3. start with the inner isles. canned goods, non-food, etc. those are heavier and nothing is worse than having cans on top of tomatoes.

4. finish up with bakery, meat and produce. if you are planning healthy meals, this should be the bulk of your cart. produce is cheap relatively cheap and if you fill your cart with it, you will save money!

5. double check that you've crossed everything off your list before you leave!

**tip:** don't forget to buy on sale, but only if it's a smart move. *don't* ""buy one get one half off"" on perishable items that you won't eat within the week. *do* take up good deals on your essentials (rice, frozen vegetables, oils, condiments). make sure to compare sales. sometimes the store brand price is already lower than the name brand sale.


there you have it! that's really my entire meal planning and shopping process. from there, all you have to do is start cooking. it takes practice to get it down, but when you've got it figured out, it starts to get easy.


**here are some additional tips i would recommend:**

1. type your meal plan with links to recipes and save them. when you don't feel like meal planning, you can resort to the archives.

2. if you don't have a food processor, get one! it's cheap and saves you so much prep time.

3. crock pot meals are amazing for those nights you want to get home and just relax. only problem is you have to prepare them the night before or in the morning. 

4. sign up for emails from sites like myfitnesspal or cooking light. it's a great place for inspiration. 

5. plan to have a night that you don't need a recipe for. grilled chicken and frozen broccoli requires like... zero brainwork. after a long day, that's important.

6. remember that cooking is an art! once you have enough experience in the kitchen, you don't need to spend as much time finding recipes. i'm at the point where i use recipes for inspiration,  but i change them depending on my preferences. 

6. remember to bring your lunch! what's the point in all this if you end up buying lunch everyday anyway?! seriously, set an alarm on your phone if you have to. but dont forget your lunch.

7. plan desserts. i have a weakness for cookies. i actually might be addicted. if i plan in a night of cookie baking, it helps me from running to mcdonald's at 9pm.

8. remember to stay stocked on your pantry staples. this list(http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/articles/basic-pantry-101.html) can help you determine what those are

"i prostituted myself for netflix.. (this requires a bit of a backstory, but i included a tl;dr)

this happened two years ago, when i was 19. i was single at the time, and most definitely ready to mingle. i had just moved to paris and pretty much had 0 contacts with anyone there. so i downloaded tinder. after a few days, i end up matching with this person, and we decide to meet each other later that night.

everything goes pretty well, and eventually things end up at my place. they ask me if i'm down for a movie on netflix, which i absolutely was. except i don't have netflix, which i shamefully let them know.
""that's alright, we can use mine.""
and so we did, and of course fifteen minutes in, the movie was paused, because, well, you see, when two people like each other... they fuck.

now i'll be honest, and this is important, the sex was definitely not the most enjoyable i've had, for reasons i'll spare. so the morning after, they leave and i don't see them again for quite some time (ooh foreshadowing).

in the weeks that follow, the person messages me to let me know they are interested in fooling around again. which i awkwardly decline for made up reasons, because i couldn't bring myself to tell them they weren't a very good sexual partner. one thing they were good at however, was not noticing that they had left their netflix open on my laptop, and that i had been using it (a lot) this whole time, until my laptop breaks, and i have to buy a new one.

now, i'm sure you're beginning to connect the dots here. no, i no longer had netflix. and yes, i was very keen on getting it again. so after about two months, i message that person to let them know that i'm interested in seeing them again. they are a bit surprised, naturally, but accept my invitation.

i was really hoping that they would want to watch netflix again, so i wouldn't have to be the one to ask, which could have blown my cover. luckily, they did. everything is going according to plan. what follows is perhaps the weirdest i've felt during sex, i wanted it over with (and ironically, it was still better than the first time). but it was well worth it.

fast forward three weeks, and i accidentally erase my history/cookies, and lose their netflix again. i prostituted myself for three weeks of netflix. i hope that's at least $10.


tl;dr: tinder date uses their netflix on my computer. sex is bad. i change computer and need their netflix again. ring ring booty call. i sleep with them despite it not being very good and get their netflix again for an entire 3 weeks. woo.

edit: i am a guy, tinder date was a girl. (i wanted to keep gender anonimity but i'm getting creepy messages)

edit 2: i am both pleasantly and unpleasantly surprised that reddit does not care what gender you are, you will receive creepy messages regardless.",12
"for refusing to kill the office spider despite one of my colleagues being scared of it?. i've had a spider in my office space for a few months now. she's a cool, small, little thing who chills near my desk and occasionally i bring her lil treats to eat. sometimes she disappears and sometimes she comes back. i've named her. i like her. 

my colleague michelle is aware of the spider, and is always complaining that it's a pest and needs to be killed. recently she saw the web, not even the actual spider, and started an official whiteboard scoresheet if anyone is in favor of the spider being removed. apparently she's super scared and terrified and being even a little bit close to my office is enough to make her jittery. 

luckily most people voted that the spider stays, but a few of her friends wrote some strongly worded notes that the spider is a sign of poor housekeeping etc. i must admit i was a little peeved at this, especially because we are a pet friendly workspace and michelle's own dog comes in to work sometimes and we have people who are genuinely frightened of dogs and michelle doesn't bother keeping her on a leash or anything. 

it came to a head when we had a meeting and michelle bought up that she refused to go into my office because of the spider and she was scared of it. my boss was a little irritated and told me to remove it or kill it, i straight up refused and told him he wouldn't ask michelle to remove her dog and the spider is a lot less threatening than a poorly behaved dog. he ultimately agreed and since then all she's done is go on about how i don't care about her feelings and that i must enjoy watching her suffer.",3
"some insights into the answer to ""why did my refund go down when i entered a second w-2 form into my tax software???"". as tax filing season gets underway, people are starting to post queries indicating confusion about why their tax software shows a big refund when they've only entered one of several w-2s and then that refund indicator drops to a smaller refund or even says they owe taxes as they enter other w-2s.

this can happen whether you are a single taxpayer with multiple w-2s or are married taxpayers filing jointly who both have incomes.

the reason this happens is the interim ""refund"" value isn't really a valid figure, because it is misrepresenting what your income is and how it gets taxed.

i'll give some numeric examples to illustrate, but first it may help to know that your w-4 ""allowances"" setting is going to influence how much of the income you earn at one job is going to be considered untaxed by the withholding system as it estimates your yearly tax in order to figure out what to withhold from any particular check.

in 2017, for single filers:  

considered not taxed = 2300 + 4050 * allowances

in 2017, for married filers:

considered not taxed = 8650 + 4050 * allowances

let's see how this plays out in some scenarios. i'm using 2017 tax numbers here, since right now people are struggling with interpreting their 2017 tax situations.

---

example a: single filer with two jobs all year

suppose you are a single filer with a 24k job and a 36k job and on both your w-4s you put ""0"" allowances, thinking that would cause more than typical withholding. let's say the 24000 job had 2789 withheld and 36000 job had 4589 withheld, which is likely amounts for full year withholding.  

job 1: 24000 wages, 2789 withheld using s-0  
job 2: 36000 wages, 4589 withheld using s-0

let's see what happens when you enter just job 1 w-2 into typical tax software. here is what the software interprets is happening.

income = 24000

deduction = 10400

taxable income = 13600

income tax = 9325 * 10% + 4275 * 15% = 1574

payments = 2789

""refund"" = 2789 - 1574 = 1215 (yay!)

i put the refund in scare quotes because this is an invalid number, since only one income has been entered. if this were your only income, you would indeed get this amount of refund. and this refund number certainly gets you thinking that the withholding at the first job was more than enough. 

---

what happens if instead you enter just job 2 w-2 into software? similarly, it would tell you you're getting a refund if that's your only income.

income = 36000

deduction = 10400

taxable income = 25600

income tax = 9325 * 10% + 16275 * 15% = 3374

payments = 4589

""refund"" = 4589 - 3374 = 1215 (yay!)

by the way, the apparent ""refund"" is the same in this example because in each case the withholding system was told to use ""0"" allowances instead of ""2"" allowances, and this made the withholding system imagine your income in each job would be 4050 * 2 = 8100 more than it really was, which causes about 8100 * 15% = 1215 too much withholding to happen for that job considered by itself.

in other situations, you may find that the nonsense ""refund"" values you see when you decide to switch the order of entering w-2 will be different, as a consequence of how allowances settings were done and what tax bracket each income seems to put you in.

notice that no matter which w-2 you enter, the withholding systems believe that some income is not taxed, some is taxed at 10%, and some is taxed at 15%, but no income is taxed at 25%. this turns out not to be true when you actually compute your tax.

----

let's see what happens when you enter the second w-2 after entering the first w-2. now the software has your actual total income information and total withholding information, and the final result is valid.

income = 24000 + 36000 = 60000

deduction = 10400

taxable income = 49600

income tax = 9325 * 10% + 28625 * 15% + 11650 * 25%

= 932.50 + 4293.75 + 2912.50

= 8139

payments = 2789 + 4589 = 7378

""amount owed"" = 8139 – 7378 = 761 (hey!)

instead of getting a refund, you actually owe about 761. yikes!

----

what happened?

was something ""wrong"" with the withholding at job 2? not really. no more than what was wrong with the withholding at job 1.

your withholding wasn't actually enough. 

using single 0 w-4 settings at both jobs wasn't enough to account for the actual tax, because some of the income really does get taxed at 25% when you ""stack"" your two incomes together. 

one way of thinking about this is that the withholding systems at both jobs effectively thought of this as how the income falls into brackets:

considered not taxed: 2300 + 2300 = 4600 (because of use of ""0"" allowances)  

considered taxed at 10%: 9325 + 9325 = 18650

considered taxed at 15%: 12375 + 24375 = 36750

considered taxed at 25%: nothing

in reality, when the two incomes are combined, this is how the actual income falls into brackets:

not taxed: 10400

taxed at 10%: 9325

taxed at 15%: 28625

taxed at 25%: 11650

although the withholding had a low value 4600 for tax-free space compared to reality of 10400, the withholding had a very skewed idea of how big the tax bracket spaces are, so the withholding systems interpreted more of the income as being taxed in lower brackets.

it's not fruitful to blame the withholding at each job. at each job, the withholding system is just following the instructions conveyed by ""0"" allowances, and it is hamstrung by not knowing the total income. each job treats your income as if it's the only job. 

solution: this taxpayer should have considered using s-0, s-0 settings but also have extra withholding taken from paychecks to send in about 760 more tax across the entire year. extra withholding of $30 from biweekly paychecks at one of the jobs would have been enough. however, owing 760 at tax time isn't going to cause this taxpayer any underpayment penalty, because it's under $1000 shy.

tldr: if your overall withholding was not enough, it's still possible for you to see an apparent interim ""refund"" value when you enter just one w-2 into tax software. you need to ignore this interim value because it doesn't represent a real refund you could get, since it is not based on knowing about all your income and all your withholding. also, you should not blame the second job as having faulty withholding.

*i'll append another scenario in a comment, involving married taxpayers, as this post is already long.*

"for not telling my husband that i know his secret. my husband and i have been married for almost two decades. we have a daughter who is my favorite person on this earth. she is so fantastic. she will be starting her senior year of high school and is preparing to apply for colleges.

i was contacted recently by another woman, who informed me that my husband had an affair with her, and when she found out about me, he arranged to pay child support for their child under the table so that i wouldn't find out. she sent me a number of documents recording bank transfers, which i was able to match to transfers from our accounts, as well as photos of my husband with their child through the years. she also provided the dates of his visits to her, which line up with several of his business trips. 

i was totally devastated and took the time to think it over and verify everything before i confronted my husband. i have decided that i am going to wait a year until i tell him that i know and file for divorce. it will be a terrible year for me but i know i can fake it since he's traveling for work a lot anyway. i have decided to do this for several reasons:

1. our daughter will be applying to college soon and will be starting a really important year. i don't want to blow her life up with a divorce and the bombshell that her father was unfaithful and now she has a sibling that neither of us knew about. 
2. my husband has many more financial resources than i do. i am well aware that if i file for divorce while our daughter still lives at home, he will leave me to care for her and will make me fight tooth and nail for monetary support and will likely drain me with legal fees, as he tends to be litigious. i make enough to support myself comfortably, but not enough to comfortably support myself and my daughter.
3. i fear that opening this door will open others. that is, i worry that he may have other children that i don't know about, which would only magnify the hurt for both me and my daughter, and i don't think that now is the time to handle it.

my question is, does my plan make me an asshole? i feel slimy not telling him right now and faking my affection for him, but i fear for my daughter's wellbeing and my own ability to support us. aita?

"i just got a 25% raise (58k to 72k)! thanks to this sub for the great advice, details inside!. hi r/personalfinance. i'd like to share my success story about recently asking for and receiving a raise.

i currently work in an account executive/outside sales position in a medium size, international company (1,500+ people). i was hired and trained straight out of college, which is extremely out of the ordinary for my type of position (most similar outside sales entry level positions are 5+ years experience). during my final interview, i was asked to name my salary expectations. i asked for 50k (which to 22 year old kid, sounded like a lot at the time) and they happily obliged. i received a 3k increase after successfully completing training and another 5k of the course of the next 3.5 years or so. i should also note that i get reimbursed fully on all gas receipts, cell phone, and a 6k per year taxable auto allowance. i also receive a yearly bonus that has usually been about 1 month of salary. my w2 showed 72k in taxable income last year.

i have been extremely successful and have worked very hard to build my own account base in my job the past 4 years. my company and direct managers are very pleased with my progress, they think i'm a hard worker, and i always get great reviews. the real problem is my salary or bonus is not based on commission. i'm salaried with a profit sharing bonus that is based on how well the company (not the individual salesperson) does. 

this past year i did very well based on all measurable metrics. i knew that if i really wanted a raise, the time to strike was now. the past 1 or 2 years, i had been approach by several headhunters. i'm not really looking for a change of scenery as my current industry is consolidating, there are financial woes, and i'm well liked and really like my current work/life balance. however, i couldn't ignore the numbers they were throwing out. the last recruiter to contact me told me the salary was up to 90k + benefits depending on experience (with a min of 3-5 years experience in my current role). 58k vs 90k is quite the discrepancy.

during my last review i mentioned to my direct manager that i was unhappy that our bonuses/salary is not based on how we do as individual sales people. i also mentioned the fact that i had been approached several times by headhunters. i reiterated that i really enjoy my job and want to stay but asked if there any way to have a review. he said that he would get the message over to hr but wouldn't promise anything. all salary decision must be reported to hq in asia for their decision. 
	
less than a week later i was told that the president of the us would be in town for unrelated business and he would like to talk to me. we met and had an hour long discussion. i was able to really get him to relate to me, i shared with him the cost of living in los angeles, how i really enjoyed working with the company and would like to continue to grow there, and how i felt my number were incredible good. he just was put into his position about a year ago, so he had no idea how much we all made.

he told me that there should be no problem getting an increase for me. all my managers think i'm very hard working, i get very good result, and i always get very high marks on my appraisals. he asked me to name a range and i asked for a bump to the 70-75k range (12-17k) increase. he told me he would send a request asap to the global vp who could decide on these matters.

less than a week later (!!) hr called and informed me that they had agreed to a 14k increase to 72k per year (25% of base!). in return, i gave them a commitment to stay for 3 years. as i mentioned before, there's a lot of turmoil and consolidation in the industry, so it's a good time to stay put and ride this out. i felt great that my managers went up to bat so fast for me and my company likes me so much they gave me a huge increase and wants to tie me up for 3 years. i'm also eligible for all future scheduled raises and i'm in a higher bracket for the year profit sharing bonus.

all in all i went from 58k salary to 72k salary effective this month! on top of the other benefits and bonus, i'll be making at least 90k per year which i'm so excited about! i was very hesitant and nervous to ask but i thought that i deserved it. i lurked this sub for good advice constantly so i wanted to share my story of good fortune! thanks to everyone for reading, let me know if you have any questions!

"for refusing to return the jeans i stole from the girl who i caught in bed with my boyfriend (ex)?. brand new account and throwaway for you guys. 

so tuesday of last week i made my now ex-boyfriend dinner. he's a paleo junkie and i really wanted to impress him so i skipped class to slice fennel with a razor blade in order to garnish the strip steak i made for him. yeah i really, really (really) loved him. i decided it would be easier to cook the steak in his kitchen so i went over to his place early (i have a code and open invite). i walked in to find half eaten dominoes pizza on the counter (remember i sliced fennel with a razor blade because he's so ""dedicated"" to paleo) and noises coming from the bedroom. 

i walked in and he was absolutely plowing a good looking girl with a spectacular body. fuck me for not eating pizza to impress him. i stood there in shock. she saw me over his shoulder first and started tapping furiously for him to get off. he turned around and hit me with the oh so classic ""this isn't what it looks like!"" 

i was speechless and had no idea what to do but i saw her clothes hanging over his desk chair. because apparently i'm a petty b!tch, the only thing i could think was i wanted her to have leave his apartment without pants. i don't know, it made sense at the time. 

he came after me begging me not to overreact, i didn't say a word and took off to my car. in the days since he's gone from begging me to ""be reasonable,"" to begging me not to break up with him and promising he'll never do it again.

the thing is, i love these jeans. yes as a trophy of me being petty and at least ruining something of hers like she had he tag teamed to ruin my heart and self esteem. but they are also a super expensive brand, they look really good on me and i like wearing them. 

so ex has gone from begging me to get back together with him to saying that me keeping the jeans is causing him ""real problems."" i don't give a slight shit about his problems but i sort of feel bad about keeping this girl's clothes. 

so i'm asking...i know i'm petty...but am i an asshole?

edit: the plot thickens, i just woke up to following text:

""hi, alyssa. this is the weirdest text i've ever written. i'm madison and i was the girl in aiden's room last week. i'm so, so, so sorry, i don't know how to say it other than that. the look on your face will haunt me for the rest of my life. please believe me when i say i didn't know he had a girlfriend. i would have never been there had i known. you have every reason not to care, but this last year has been so hard for me, my dad died of pancreatic cancer in december and i'm struggling so hard and find myself making bad choice after bad choice which i how came to be in aiden's room. the pants you have are the ones i bought the day before my dad died, he gave me ""permission"" to go treat myself and it's the last time i ever heard him call me by his pet name as in ""pumpkin, please don't be afraid to get you want, buy your jeans."" it would mean the world to me if you returned them to me. i know you've been hurt and i feel for you and i think aiden is pure scum, all i want from him is getting my pants back. please find it in your heart to return them to him or contact me directly. thank you so much, madison.""

so i guess i have to give them back...i'm in tears here.

edit 2: just woke aiden up at 5:45 (on org chem test day too...fuck him) with ""what's madison's last name?"" he tried to give me the ""who's madison?"" at first but then told him she texted me. he tried to talk me out of it but then relented so he could go back to sleep. so i looked her up on facebook and it's pretty bare but she does have a ""instamodel"" sister who has all sorts of sad posts with like her holding her dads hand while has iv and then a somewhat touching insta memorial to her dad...so i'm thinking the text is not a lie.

edit3: i just texted back and forth with her, we're meeting at starbucks at 9.


edit4: (wednesday evening—had tried to do a new post but mods suggested i just edit the op...so this is a cut and paste. hope it makes sense i'm just starting on my second bottle of skinny girl so hope this makes sense) so wow, that first post got a ton of heat and i'm so thankful, really for the chance to get some input but also because a lot of you are very, very funny and i appreciated the laughs. i don't know what the overall verdict was but i'm ok to think i was being an asshole in keeping the jeans.

so like many of you saw, the girl (madison) texted me overnight telling me about why the jeans were important to her and asking if i would give them back. we texted back and forth a few times this morning and agreed we'd meet at the starbucks by campus so i could return them. i got there and instantly recognized her and she got up and gave me a hug which i thought was very sweet (i'm a hugger too) and she had bought me like three different varieties of venti drinks to make sure she got one i liked (or as she admitted later, she was so nervous she didn't know what to do) which i also thought was very cool. i wasn't sure whether or not i even really wanted to talk with her but the coffee was enough entre to get me to sit down. i handed her the jeans and she was very thankful and again explained the story about her dad and teared up. lots of people told me not to believe her but if she's lying, she's a sociopath because i could tell she was really upset by it. i did my best to comfort her which i hope was well received.

so as we got past that the only things i wanted to know were: how long had she known aiden, did she know about me being his girlfriend and was she hoping to continue seeing him. she said they met when he and some friends went to her restaurant maybe a month ago and had been texting back and forth ever since, she said last tuesday was the first time they'd met in person and she said she swore to god she didn't know he had a girlfriend. she said after i showed up tuesday she was so disgusted she got dressed in her spare clothes (fat lot of good it did me to steal her jeans if my plan was to embarrass her) and left and didn't even process that her special jeans were gone until about a day later when she stared bugging him to get them back but she had no interest in seeing him. she said she was so frustrated with him stonewalling her had stopped by to get my number directly but he wouldn't even do that so she got it from his neighbor who happened to hear them arguing...she'd had my number since sunday but was too nervous to text until yesterday.

lots more happened and i can expand more in the comments but i think i'm running out of room...anyways so our plan is she is not going to tell him that i gave her the jeans back and start to demand he pay for them or buy her a new pair. when he does, she'll just give me the money or the jeans and then we'll give him the old...""thanks for the jeans but us adults already worked it out...toodles."" yes we are deceiving him but we both agree he deserves it.
like i said lots more details but running into the 3000 character limit so i can say more if anyone is interested. thank you for being so invested in my life. i've felt pretty rejected since this all went down and will have a hole in my heart for a long time...the kindness of internet strangers really, really helped for a few hours",3
"my wife f(31) sent me m(30) a snap chat with a filter that had her in mascara and dark lipstick.. her text on the snap was a sarcastic ""pretty lol"" but to be quite honest she was drop dead gorgeous.  

  

now on the surface that sounds wholesome and there doesnt seem to be anything that advice is needed for right?  

  

well my wife almost never wears makeup. no powder, no mascara, not even eye liner or lipstick.  pretty much the only thing that goes on her face is chapstick.  

  

she has all of these things and will put on eye liner on our ""date nights"" or a fancy get together but that is pretty much it.   

  

we have been happily married for going on 7 years and i have never had a problem with no makeup. she is as beautiful to me today as ever.  

  

but that snap she sent just did something for me. i dont know if it was the dark lipstick (i was a goth kid in highschool), or if it was just makeup in general but fuck if she didnt look the hottest i have ever seen her minus our wedding night.  

  

so the thing i need advice for: how do i tell her this? do i tell her this? if i tell her this how can i do it in a way that doesnt scream i am an asshole that thinks she is only pretty cause she put make up on?   

  

i want to see her in make up like full on like the snap. not all day everyday. maybe just like on our datenights. or even just once a year.   

  

i dont know i feel selfish and assholeish just typing this up. any help is appreciated.",7

it has been about a month or so since i posted and i figured i would update you guys(since i love updates). unfortunaly is not a good one...

my father asked for a divorce about a week after the post, it caught me out of guard and i was shocked. they talked before this but my dad came home even more upset than the day on the restaurant.

he asked me whether i'd like to live with him or my mom and i chose him. i love my mom to death but on the day-to-day basis i get along better with my father. i called her to explain but as soon as i said said she disconnected the call so yeah.... i wrote her a letter and tried to give when we went home to her our things but she ripped off, which was very painful to see. my dad and brother started screaming at her and i left with my sil.

i went with my dad to have a consultation with my psychologist and they tried to help me see why she is doing this. from what i can understand, there might be some reasons

i went through a pretty tough period, i got depressed, anxious and had some problems with eating disorder but i've been in medication and therapy, which has helped a lot. after this i felt much happier and had energy to work on myself, i started working out with my brother, my sil teached me how to use make up and my grandma gave me a bunch of gift cards to buy some new clothes. i've also started trying new hobbies and my days are really busy.

we think that my mom started feeling left out and jealous of me, especially since my brother/dad started paying more attention to me and i know they have actively making an effort to compliment me and pay attention to what i say/am interested in.

she thought that with the new baby she would be the grandma but she and my sil don't get along that well(they don't fight but they don't have much in common either) and i guess she was feeling pretty sad.

after the post i started wondering whether my mom had been through some sort of abuse, which could explain her reaction to my dad seeing me naked and whatnot. it wasn't that.

my dad said he was a victim of sexual abuse and that it came from someone he trusted and was family, so my mom saying this made him enraged. he tried talking to her after but apparently she just kept implying it and he can't keep being married to someone who would say this.

there's more about it but that's basically what went wrong.

i'm honestly heartbroken, i can't wrap my head around what my mom did and i still feel guilty about this whole story(even more now, since it was bc of me that felt left out). i don't know what our relationship will be like, my dad has the full custody but said i could visit her anytime i want but we haven't talked yet and she hasn't tried to contact me.

my brother still talks to her but not as much, he says she is ok, he said she asks about me but i think he's lying. 

we are living with my grandma but will move to a new house next month, it seems like a cool place and is close to my brothers work.

on a happier note, sil is almost ready for the baby and the name i suggested was the chosen one! i can't wait to meet my niece :d

"by letting a guy use my bathroom during our garage sale. happened over the summer.

so, we're in the process of moving and i figure now is a good time to unload most of the stuff my wife and i have collected over the years- which is a lot considering we have children. last weekend we had a pseudo-estate sale in which was staged in half of the house, driveway, and garage. considering it was about 1,000 degree outside, i took the garage while my wife manned the inside post. midway through the day, an elderly gentleman asked if he could you my bathroom- he explained he just took medicine and didn't think he'd be able to make it home. now, my wife and i had serious rules about this- our answer was supposed to be no bathroom for customers. however, i had to make a snap judgement call and this guy looked very well put together. i also thought that he just took a water pill that lots of old folks are on and he just needed to take a quick squirt and we'd all be fat, dumb, and happy. but i'm not a complete idiot. i told him he'd better check with the boss upstairs because of the aforementioned agreement. he chuckled and understood and away he went. 10 minutes or so later, i see him leaving. i figured all is well.
a few minutes after that, my wife comes down to the driveway glaring at me. i assumed it was because i shirked the responsibility of telling this old guy no bathroom and made her look like the bad guy if she said ""no"". i couldn't be more wrong. apparently this guy had a colostomy bag and it was chock full of shit. he tried to change it out in our bathroom and spilled the entire contents all over the floor and made no attempt to clean it up. he simply walked out of the bathroom and told my wife our dog must have had an accident. he. blamed. my. dog.",4
"my tenant cut down trees in my yard. including my apple tree. we live in bc canada.  

so here's the story. 

renters moved in may 15. they asked that we take the house off the market, they will sign a two year lease and pay $2000 a month, $100 more than we were asking for. immediately they were late paying rent and since then, have not paid rent on time once. numerous messages every month with excuses as to why rent couldn't be paid on time.  june 7 he asked me to pay someone to care for the yard because they couldn't afford a lawn mower. i reminded them that it was in the rental agreement that they care for the yard because we are 10 hours away and that we need a somewhat self sufficient tenant. more months of late rent and complaints about small issues which we immediately attended to by sending someone in (furnace filter needed changing, toilet ring needed replacing in both bathrooms, dryer needed to be cleaned) 

july 21 he messages me about pruning the trees and cutting and getting rid of them. i clearly stated in text that he was not allowed to cut the trees down. 

sept 14 we have friends come visit and tell us our grass is about 3 feet tall so i send this message to my tenant ""hey chris, could you please now the lawn or at least pay someone to mow it and clean it up. just got a call from a neighbor concerned that the place isn't being cared for. said the lawn was out of control""

he proceeds to bitch that the yard has been a disaster since he moved in in the spring and that he shouldn't have to do a dump run for the garbage in the yard. the ""garbage"" i explained were painted decorative tires for growing potatoes with the garden and if he wasn't going to use them he could store them in one of the 3 sheds but to not throw them out. 

today oct 3 he sends me pictures saying he cleaned up the yard and i see that my apple tree in the front yard is missing and the choke cherry tree in the back yard is also missing. he did not have permission to cut them down, i explained this to him and he says ""i did not touch either of the big trees anymore than i showed you a couple of months ago and you had no problem then. if you are not happy i apologize but you told me to deal with the yard so i dealt with it so that i was happy with the way the yard looked. sorry we didn't know the tree in the front yard was to stay. we checked it and it hadn't produced anything. ""

we pruned the apple tree end of last summer so of course it won't produce apples this season!!

now he is trying to get out of his lease by telling me to evict him but i want repayment for my trees. it was stated in the least that they weren't allowed to remove any permanent fixtures pertaining to the property without written consent from us.

"for having an ""unhealthy relationship"" with my daughter?. this is something i did not put much thought into but since my ex expressed her outrage, perhaps the internet can judge this. 


without too much context, my ex left me and our daughter jo(not real name) many years ago and i have been raising her all by myself these years. she is 27 now, still living with me and works in a cafe nearby. 


jo, while having the intelligence of a normal person(aced in chemistry back in school), has the emotional maturity of a child. it does not take much for her to get upset or become happy, she loves praises and hugs, dislike strangers but warms up to them easily. she gets awkward talking to adults and loves playing with children, but would also pick fights and throw tantrums despite being 3 times their age. i can give more examples but i hope you get the idea. 


me and jo split the house chores and takes turns to cook for each other. we would also do ""goodbye hug"" and ""goodnight kiss"" on the cheek every day when we leave for work or go to sleep, separate rooms, to be clear. i would praise jo if she has done her part of the chores properly as she likes praises, and also buy her snacks from time to time. 


i have not find another partner after my ex because jo would certainly be upset, and i have gotten used to staying this way. jo has been single too(as far as i know) and has shown no intention of moving out, which i am fine with it. there has only ever been 2 of us in the house after ex moved. 


my ex, whose private life is not mine to share, paid us a visit some time ago, a long time in many years for an update on jo. she was absolutely disgusted of our lifestyle. she said we were living like a couple which is not supposed to be, we are father and daughter for christ sake! she demanded that we seek therapy and have jo moved out so that she can be independent and have her own life. jo in turn, screamed at her birth mother and kicked her out of the house.  


i have nothing on my conscience as we never ever did anything questionable or vile. therapy? we are both happy adults enjoying our lives. have jo move out? if she wants i won't stop her, but if she's happy here then she can stay as long as she likes. 


i do think i am not the ah who ""ruined"" my daughter's life with this ""unhealthy relationship"", but i shall leave you to judge. aita?


info: it is not medically proven but i believe jo is not in the spectrum or has disabilities as many of you think. she is smart and functional and capable of living by herself(proven when i went business trips and left her home alone when she was in her teens, the house was kept clean and tidy), but she is also lazy and enjoys being spoilt. she has 2 close friends her own age, also single, and would hang out with them sometimes. i also believe that therapy is only required if it cause problems, and if she is happy with her life, even if it is a little out of the norm, i don't think we need any therapy.",3

"when i was 5, i accidentally gave a girl in my class permanent brain damage. it was many years ago. the girl in question was the daughter of the woman that babysat me. every morning their mother would rummage through my lunch box and give her kids all of my treats and other stuff my own parent had packed for me. despite the fact it wasn't the girl's fault, i hated her for it.

one day we were in class and were released for recess. our class was notorious for never getting the little red bikes that there were only a few of because our teacher never let us out in time to get them. it was a first come first serve situation, with the entire school rushing to get these little bikes. this particular day we had gotten out early enough, and i was running towards a bike when the daughter of my babysitter rushed up and grabbed it right in front of me. i was furious and sad at the same time. in a fit of jealousy, i pushed her off the bike, got on it, and rode off. all i remember after that is cycling around the yard and looking over at a gathering of adults. they'd formed a circle around the girl and rushed her away. i never saw her again.

fast forward a few years later, and i'm in my early teens. my parent introduces me to the family that used to babysit me. ""don't you remember so and so?"", and this is when i found out i had given this girl brain damage. it had stunted her growth and she developed a serious learning disability because of it. i felt petrified and extremely guilty, but i never said anything to anyone. 

they never found out who had done it. nobody had witnessed me do it. turns out everybody thought she had just fallen off, and someone else grabbed the bike. she had no memory of what had happened, either. i still think back to it years later.",12
"for correcting my cousin publically over her claiming no one in the family had ever been to university before her child?. the title probably gives 90% of the information, but i'll provide a bit more context.

i, along with my brother, just graduated from university. my first cousin once removed (aged 18) is just about to start university after the summer. my cousin, the child's mother, just posted a long, congratulatory post on facebook (she just had her offer bumped up to an unconditional place). in this post, she went on and on about how child will be the first in the whole wider family to go to university. she listed off how her and her husband's parents, aunts and uncles (including my dad, the cousin's uncle) and all their kids haven't been able to attend university, and how her child will start a new generation of university attendees.

i don't know whether she was playing dumb or had just had a brain fart, but she knows that both myself and my brother just graduated from university. i would have given her the benefit of the doubt for just meaning the 'adults' in the family hadn't been into further study (my dad was born 10 years after his next youngest siblings, which is why i have cousins 20ish years older than me, and a 17 year old first cousin once removed), but since she name-checked and tagged us in with everyone else, it felt like it was deliberate.

i replied congratulating my second cousin, phrasing a second part of the comment as 'so great to see another surname starting their next stage in life, just after brother and i graduate from our universities!', to politely remind her that her bold claims were false. a little while later i got a message from my aunt, my cousin's mother, asking me to remove the comment since cousin was embarrassed and felt like i was trying to one-up her (even though that's exactly what the tone of her post was).

i haven't yet removed the comment, but woke up feeling pretty asshole-ish, and probably will remove the comment later on. just how much am i in the wrong?

edit: thanks for the advice everyone, we've had to pander to my cousin before over things, so i need to learn to stand up for myself. also i know i messed up in correctly labelling who everyone is, the person going to university soon is my first cousin once removed, and her mum is my cousin. i also got a pronoun wrong at some point too, my brother and i were the people who graduated a few weeks ago. finally, to everyone saying my profile picture should be me in my gown, it already was!!

2nd edit: i know i got the proper name for my first cousin once removed wrong!! i didn't want to change it in the post since i've seen so many times about how changing posts automatically means you're a liar and karma-seeker, but every pm saying 'just so you know...' is slowly breaking my soul! again, apologies, family tree labels are my achille's heel apparently!",3

 fast forward to today, he told me his girlfriend got the job, and they sent her a check that she was about to cash (~$2400) to buy equipment. immediately i remembered that post, and fortunately i was able to find it and show him this is a common scam. i didn't want to rain on their parade or seem jealous that she got a ""well paying job"", so i told them just to call the bank on the check just to be sure. his girlfriend was literally waiting in line at her bank, right about to deposit it, when he called her to check...sure enough it was fraudulent and she's contacting the local fraud department to report this!

edit 2: glad a lot of people could read this! it's really important (i especially learned today) to be ~~weary~~ wary of ""too good to be true"" situations! ask questions and be skeptical!

edit 3: i think i now have a pretty good understanding on how the scammer makes money off of this now. they send you a fake check, but the bank lets it go through for your own convenience; you then buy the scammer's ""equipment"" (the vendor you get the equipment is also a scam, just to get your money, you never get the supplies that you payed for), but the bank eventually figures out the check is bogus, takes the full amount out of your account, even if you go negative in which case they'll demand you pay the amount asap or forgo repercussions.

the kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. the first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. the second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. the third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. 


the night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. the knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. 


in the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. he fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

**good news!** my husband talked to him yesterday and r finally moved out last night. r gave him the following excuses: he couldn't find his sheets, he didn't have internet and that his new room mate had been out of town. i say excuses because i think it sounds like bs. r's new roommate has been living in that place for months at least, so most definitely has the internet set up. i know they are splitting the bill not having separate accounts. and i feel like the roommate being out of town would actually be a good time to get the rest of his things moved in and set up.

and most importantly: r mentioned last night that he had leftover food at the new place which means he's been at the new place, i think likely sleeping there since he hasn't been sleeping here. even if he didn't have internet, why was he still showering here in the morning and keeping his clothes here. even if he has been sleeping at his girlfriend's house, why would he drive all the way to the new place just to drop off food?

idk, i might just be bitter.

**cleaning update:** although he didn't take out the trash last night, it is all in a bag. the bathroom is relatively cleaner because i left disinfectant and bleach all over it the day before yesterday so he was forced to wipe it up. it will need another pass, but screw it. he told my husband that he would come back today to vaccuum, finish cleaning etc. if he does, great, but at this point it is no longer disgusting so i don't mind finishing up.

i am so at peace. i slept like a rock last night. and tomorrow i will change the lock. :)

"update: for not wanting to participate in my niece's wedding after she excluded my daughter?. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/c7jfwy/aita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my_nieces/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app

hey everyone! this is the daughter writing the update. my mom didn't know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. we're both here to respond to comments if you have any.

i saw that a few people asked what my aunt's opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! here is the answer to that question: my aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that i be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. my cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. 

i also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that i wasn't telling my mom. this is definitely valid question! the answer is no, she and i haven't had any problems prior to this (that i know of, at least). she has always been like a sister to me. if she ever had a problem with me or anything i've done i would hope she would tell me.

another question i saw was about my relationship with my father. he and i have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. prior to all of this i had confided in my cousin a lot about this. this made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.

after reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. i appreciate her desire to stand up for me but i really did want my cousin's wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). my mom respected my wishes. she is an amazing mom all around and i am lucky to have her in my corner. 

after the conversation i had with my cousin (described in the last post) i was on the fence about attending the wedding. i then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that i would ""sabotage the wedding"" if i were to attend. i found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. at this point i decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. i told her that i wouldn't be attending and left it at that. it was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.

the wedding did end up going smoothly. i heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. i wish i could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. she and i have both been part of each other's major life milestones for as long as i can remember. i still haven't figured out why i was the only one excluded but i have come to the conclusion that she and i must not be as close as i had always thought we were. at this point i'm not sure that i want to be. your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.

thanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses! we got great insight from everyone who commented (especially those with different perspectives from our own). if you guys have any more questions feel free to comment!",3

we live in the same neighbourhood so we occasionally see each other when we're out and about. the night before last we ran into each other at the post office. we talked while we waited in line and after that we had a coffee together. when he asked me if i wanted to go back to his place i agreed. i honestly don't even know why; i just wasn't thinking straight. we had a glass of wine and then we wound up having sex.

"im utterly sh*t at saving, so i forced myself to open an account i cant touch and i am forcing myself to save. (nz). i find myself flush with cash, all the time. however i usually just end up pissing it away on useless things- like bacon, for example. the really expensive bacon. then cars, i went and bought a $65,000 car last year, then it ended up being written off due to mechanical issues (no fault of my own, the ""warranty"" at the dealership was a fat waste of money and they found a way to slime their way out of paying out for the work). 

so, high time i put cash aside as last year my s.o got cancer and it was a wake up call that i did not have a slush fund/emergency fund sitting on call if i really really needed it. 

i set up a bank account with rabobank (the biggest bank in holland, i understand). anyways, here in nz they open it up without any branch visits or actual physical locations (all done online). then they provide an electronic two tier authentication device that you need to log into the internet banking every single time. 

well, that second tier device i have given to my s.o and she has put it away where i ""cant find it"". the password is all in my head (a significant event in my life, the date of which only i know and it is burnt into my memory) so i have the password- she has the keys. only when we really need it- will we access it with ""our powers combined"" (not a cpt planet reference but yes that did play out in my head r/nostalgia) 

will move it up to $1000, then put that amount into a higher earning term deposit account then move the balance up to another $1000, then rinse and repeat. in a few years time i hope to have a bunch of $1000 financial babies flapping around and hope to instill a habit of saving to my kids as well. each $1000 parcel will have its own purpose attached to it (car troubles, funeral expenses if a family member died, illness, bacon shortage on a global scale).. you get the idea.

would like to thank this subreddit for popping up so much on my home page that i finally decided to sort my shi* out.

- many people asked what car it was - audi q7! (insert childish vvvvrrrrbbooomm noise). 
- the fond appreciation my fellow human being shares for bacon has me thinking there is a hope for humanity after all. perhaps bacon could solve the north korean conflict?
- to the woman that commented saying her husband had to put the bacon down and walk away from it, dm me and i will get a bacon related gift for him to make up for it!

"for not bringing my mom with me on vacation because she doesnt give credit where credit is due?. we are from the philippines and my mom is extremely religious. i am a closeted atheist since i was about 13. my mom had quite a tough-ish life due to (mostly) her bad decisions like not being good with money, refusing every good opportunity that came her way because she believed in ""signs from god"" (e.g. someone offered her a substantial amount of money for something she wasn't selling, she prayed and asked god ""if this is a bad decision, let person x come by my house this week"" but person x comes by our house 2-3x a week. while i told her it's a very good decision to sell, since person x comes by anyway she follows her ""sign""). she's a single mom and i am her only child. so i always dreamt of giving her a good life.

i learned to not follow her mistakes, and i suppose this is why i became an atheist. i worked extremely hard because i wanted a different life from that of my mom. 25 yrs later, i became quite successful. bought her a house, a car and an allowance each month. 

she never once thanked me. instead, she thanked god. i ignored this at first, but then she got quite extreme. i mentioned to her that i did work pretty hard to get here, and she says things like ""this is god's reward to me, all those years of following him. i deserve/earned this"" and ""it was through my prayers and faith that he listened and gave you the strength to push through. if you think this was purely because of you, you are sorely mistaken!""

i am going to australia for a holiday, i wanted to take her and she said something like ""praise be to him! he loves me so much, he knew i deserve to have a vacation!"" i don't know why, but it rubbed me the wrong way and told her ""nevermind, i'm going alone."" 

she's upset, asked why and i said that i am so sick and tired of hearing her praise some being for my hard work and love. she said i am being ungrateful and delusional if i think my success was because of ""just me working hard""",3

"im sick of the double standard for big dogs. my friend sent a video of their small dog to our group chat, it was snarling, had its teeth bared, and was nipping, it was clearly doing ""stay away from me"" behaviour, but everyone ignored it, talking about how cute it is.
i called it out saying that their dog seems unhappy and they're obviously distressing it. everyone was saying that thats just how terriers act, and maybe they do, i don't know, but it still fucks me up.
i have a big dog, and if he was to try to bite me and bare his teeth at me everyone would lose their minds. he's been attacked by a small dog before, all because he walked near it at the big dog park. why it was in that part of the park i have no idea. the owner did nothing and i ended up having to kick the little dog away and grab my boy and run. if it had been a larger dog attacking him it would have been put down. it wouldn't have been cute, and people would have been appalled at the dogs and owners behaviour. but no, its a cute little fluffy dog, so its fiiine.

and when my dog and i are on walks we always have little dogs trying to attack us and the owners rarely do anything about it. we've had one big dog bark at us and it was handled incredibly well by its owner.

im just sick of the double standard and small dog owners ignoring what their dogs are doing and what their dogs are telling them.

i'd like to edit this to add that i don't hate small dogs, nor do i think they're all aggressive, and not all big dogs are sweeties. but in my experience big dogs are trained and small dogs are not. i have an issue with owners, not dogs.

editing again to address some comments.
1. why am i crying about this? cause thats basically what this sub is for, and i'm expressing my frustrations
2. yes i know small dogs can't do as much damage as big dogs, that doesn't mean that them biting is any less serious of a behavioural issue, you're kind of proving my point by treating it like that
3. my main issue is that small dogs comfort is ignored in favour of their owners laughing at them, its messed up, and i wanted to vent that. i ended up going on a bit of a tangent though lol.
4. finally, i don't hate small dogs, i'm sure they can be great, i just don't like owners who refuse to train them because they're not actually dangerous. see point 2.",11

**update:** just posted here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2l5lo/update_just_found_out_my_husband_28m_invited/) my apologies for the concerns questioning the validity of my post. i used the same throwaway account in another sub to ask a question in which i scrambled identifying information. thanks to the mods here for keeping shitposts out of the feed, and for taking the time to verify my identity. 

long time lurker, first time poster. throwaway for obvious reasons.

i (24f) leave on a flight in 3 hours for a 5 day business trip. my husband (28m)  is currently sleeping, and i'm finishing packing. i text message popped up on his phone saying, ""yeah, i'd love to spend the night! that'll make things so much easier."" it was from a friend (18f) of his who we've had disagreements over before (mostly because he doesn't feel the need to tell me anything about her, when they hang out, etc. which he does on his own for all of his male friends). he has a number of female friends, and i really don't mind. they're good people, and there seem to be boundaries in place. not with this girl though. texts from her frequently pop up throughout the day, and as late as 1 and 2 in the morning.

i'll admit it, curiosity got the better of me, and i read their previous few messages. he invited her over to go on a day trip with him to his favorite place to smoke weed. it's her first time. he then invited her to stay the night before, so they could get an early start the next day.

thing is, as we were going to bed last night, i asked him what his plans were while i was gone. he usually makes an effort to do something fun for himself, and to get one big honey-do item taken care of. when we were talking about my trip last night, he was very detailed in his plans (down to what he'll be doing each day, which was unusual) but he made no mention of this girl, and made it sound as though he was making the drive alone. when i suggested he hang out with one of his friends, he said ""i dunno. i think i could use a quiet weekend in.""

i'm freaking out a bit. we have been having some trouble, and i saw in their messages that he's been talking to her about it... a lot. i get needing to have a friend to talk to, but he's always telling me he doesn't want his friends to think poorly of me. yet from their messages, she obviously does.

reddit, what do i do? how do i handle this?

edit: i should mention that he's had a history of hiding behavior with women from me. thing is, i'm really easy going and whenever he tells me ""so and so is coming over"" i'm the one who brings home snacks for them. yet he's also lied about talking with a female coworker about sex (very late at night), and sharing a bed with someone he used to hook up with, to name a few. i feel so stupid.

edit 2: any advice for bringing this up? part of me wants to confront him before i go. we had a really great (i thought) conversation last night where we decided to take this time apart to figure out what our marriage needs, and what each of us needs individually, so we can make things work. apparently he needs her.

the other half of me wants to wait until i know she's there, and then ask him what's up. i'm not really sure what to do, i've never been in this position before.",7

"my husband m34 gave me f29 herpes after cheating with a sex worker. we've been together 7 years, married for 4. my sexual preferences are pretty boring, i just like regular old vanilla stuff. his tastes are a little more adventurous. i've always said i'm happy to try anything once. trouble is i've never enjoyed any of the things we've tried and i feel like i'm leaving him unsatisfied. he floated the idea of maybe seeing a sex worker to allow him to explore some of these kinks and i said maybe that was an option we could consider at some stage. we are in australia where sex work is legal. 

anyway, recently he went on a work trip to italy for 10 days. he used the services of a local mtf sex worker. he didn't tell me about it. we had sex the day he got home. a few days later i was feeling unwell and experiencing strange symptoms, went to the doctor and found out it was herpes. 

i confronted him about it and he admitted what he had done and that he had also noticed a spot/mark on his penis but 'didn't think anything of it'. 

i'm so upset that not only did he go ahead and sleep with someone without checking in with me, he also put my health at risk. the least he could have done was get an std test afterwards. i'm also now wondering if he would have ever told me if he hadn't been 'sprung'. 

i've always tried to be accomodating and understanding of his needs so i don't know why he felt the need to go behind my back. i now find it hard to trust him and i don't know if i can have sex with him again. is our relationship salvageable? or are we just sexually incompatible?

you got played bitch! and fourteen years of fuck you.


***from a post below.*** (added for context)

sorry, i was in a weird state. emotions and all that junk. i guess i still am.
kate is my cousin, my closest friend from childhood. when i was 11 (and she was 14), something happened. my social awkwardness and general shyness meant she was my only female contact. i looked upto her for almost everything. she took advantage of me. our relationship went from being cousins and friends to me being her playtoy and experimentation device. i was afraid to speak to anyone initially. i tried talking to some friends i made at school who promptly told me to man up and stop being a girl. apparently i was lucky to have a reasonably ""hot"" chic at my disposal and a fag for not enjoying it.
i spent months scared shitless about her getting pregnant with my child. finally when i decided to speak to a family member about it, she flipped the story completely. i was branded a perv, a creep and a physho who saw his cousin sexually. not even my parents believed me, she played it perfect. apart from two people in my extended family, no one offered me any supporting words. for them i was everything that was wrong. kate was the exploited poor soul. she had support, she had friends, she had cousins. her friends made my life hell in school. my parents never bothered to listen to my side. the idea of a girl taking advantage of a guy was not very (for the lack of better words) convincing to them.
i begged her for years to help me, pleaded to own up and let me live a semi-normal life. she never did. after 3/4 years of trying i stopped. i thought i stopped caring. i didnt. recently i got in touch with her. actually i initiated contact over facebook. i made up a bunch of stuff about how it was all my mistake and how i loved all those things. over a period of a month and half i plotted like i was going to war against a country. we started talking on skype and yesterday she told me she was a bit drunk. i got her talking, i faked a bunch of emotions and somehow made her say how she loved it and how she made me do those things. i recorded the whole conversation and sent it to everyone in my family.
the biggest bitch was our aunt. some sort of feminist activist (i dont know what she is exactly. she writes some blogs and all and i have seen her quoted on reddit a couple of times.). she was the one who made my life hell the most. she made me look (even though i was 13ish) like i was some perverted fuck. i hope (even more than kate) she listens to that entire conversation. i hope.

***updates***

i still cant bring myself to check emails. that email went to about 15 people and i dont know what to expect. but i switched on my phone to a flurry of voicemails from my mom and one from her brother and one from another cousin. mom is crying in a bunch of them, just asking me to pick up. looks like my parents want to come over today. i sent mom a text not to. i told her i cant deal with all this right now and i will be ok. her  brother just said  ""dude what the fuck did you do that for"" and hung up. the cousin just said he was sorry.

oddly, talking here is holyshitmotherfuckingawesome relief. i have never been this peaceful and calm in years. thanks everyone for listening. thanks for all the supporting replies and pms. i guess i underestimated the power of internet hugs. 

i am planning to seek help. i am going to talk to someone this week. you guys should know you all are unbelievably cool people and that i will forever be in your debt. i guess i am trying to say thanks. 


***update 2***

so i looked down and realized that i still had them gonads and decided to check on emails. expected the worst, but it turned out that i just had one reply. from kate's boyfriend. he said sorry and he told me i could have not sent this to him as all the other people in the list were family(or extended). i guess he is right. good thing is that he is not going to do anything about their relationship based on this, atleast not immediately. roy, you are a good man, i guess. 

her brother called and texted a bunch of times. he is being a dick. the one time i picked up, he told me how i have ruined kate's life. (right!!!!) he goes on a lecture about how this happened when we were kids and i am an asshole for doing this so late. (maybe i am, but i needed closure and i needed this to keep my head sane). 

its not like i didnt give her a chance to come clean. i asked for 3 years, till she was 18-19 to own up. i thought she was adult enough at that age. 

looks like i will have thanksgiving this year! :) thanks y'all. again, brohugs and internet hugs - looks like they work. i have the biggest smile on my face as i type this.

***update 3***

i want to start off by saying a big thanks to y'all. i did not expect this to help me so much, a bunch of random strangers talking to me and giving me support. i cannot overstate how much this means to me. i have a question as part of this update.  so, i know for a fact that my aunt has read the email and has listened to the audio. her comment was something along the lines of me still being wrong and how this doesnt prove anything and finally i should not have done this to kate. apparently i am an adult who cant think like an adult. all the things that happened to me over the years have turned me into some sort of person with an agenda against the ladies. 

i dont have an agenda. some people have suggested via comments and pm to talk to police with this evidence. while that might be the right thing to do, i dont want to tread that path. but my aunt's site still has references to this incident. obviously there are no names. but if someone familiar with this incident reads it, they will know its about me. i found two of her blog posts from 2009/2010 where she uses me and this incident as an example. i would really like to know if there is something which i can do to discredit this. obviously, i should talk to a lawyer  if i need to pursue this. but before i even go to one, i would really like to know if this is possible. more than personal, this is a matter of principles. she shouldnt be using a lie to establish her theory as valid. even if one person reads this, it could have some effect on them. she mentions that she knows both parties. i want those statements removed from the so called ""articles"". is this something which i should pursue or is is a waste of time?

to the good things.

i spoke with my mom. she cried, i cried, she cried more, i cried more, we spoke. she said she could have handled this better. i told her thats all i needed to hear. looks like i am going home this thanksgiving.

"there should be absolutely no limits to comedy. you do not get to cherrypick what is or is not suitable for comedy. if you are ever offended by any joke made by a comedian, please have the common fucking decency to be offended by all of them (sloss)

change my mind. 

edit: okay this blew up. good to see many valid point being raised put here. just to clarify: i never said you have to find it funny, but if you can watch a show and laugh at all the gay jokes, fat jokes, whatever-jokes but draw the line at something like rape jokes then that's ridiculous. you can't cherrypick what can and what cannot be joked about. there's many things we 'as a society' don't like to talk about, many taboos that hold us back and we find it difficult to talk about, let alone joke about. sometimes, stepping out of your comfort zone is okay. of course, i've felt a sense of like ""woah"" when i heard a comedian make a joke that i felt went a little far, but it helps me sit back and think. why did i feel like it crossed a line? if it's just downright outrageous, ridiculous comedy, trying to be as offensive as possible then that's just a genre of comedy. it might not be for you, simply because it's not your type of humor, but it has a right to exist as a genre.

"if i canceled my nephew's college fund over his rudeness?. my wife and i have been married for 12 years, and the nephew in question is my brother's oldest son, who i'll call michael for this post. michael is 16 and the oldest of my brother's two boys. 

michael was a baby when my wife and i got together, and she has always treated him and my brother's other son like family, just the same as she treats her own siblings' kids. my wife has a significant inheritance and we both earn generous wages, and it was her idea to open college savings accounts for michael and his brother when they were babies. this is likely to be the only family money for college they'll receive.

anyway, the story: last weekend, my brother and the boys came over for dinner and we all had a nice time, though the youngest one was on his switch the whole time and michael was on his phone. i didn't think anything of it until the following tuesday, when i found my wife sobbing after work and she showed me an instagram post made by michael, who apparently is too stupid to realize we both follow him (as do his grandparents). 

he posted a picture of my wife from behind and a picture he apparently took of her underwear laid out on our bed, both mocking her size (she is overweight) and calling her a 'big bitch' among other things. my wife was devastated and humiliated and hurt, because she's always had a good relationship with him.

i'm furious and want to cancel his college savings account right now, taxes be damned. my wife says she'd be too embarrassed to do this since she's an adult and shouldn't be so hurt by a child, and just wants to pretend it didn't happen. i already told his dad and let his dad deal with it at home, but i'm still furious and want to cancel the account monday.

if i did this? is it too much? he won't have any family money for school if i do but that isn't my problem if he comes into my home and violates my wife's privacy and disrespects her like that.

edit: i am overwhelmed by the number of kind and thoughtful responses i received and can't reply to all of them, but i really appreciate everyone taking the time. i didn't expect the thread to blow up like this so to say it gives me a lot to think about is an understatement. i have some thinking to do and will update in a few days when i've cooled down a bit.",3

"for telling my mom that i caught my aunt and my adult brother having sex (and getting her kicked out)?. i'll just get right into it. my aunt had been staying with us for 4 months. we never saw her  often because she lives on the other side of the country but my mom took her in after a horrible divorce. i immediately noticed that she was acting a little weird/loony but i attributed that to having gone through so much with her husband. my brother (who's 20) seemed to make a lot of effort to spend time with her but i didn't think anything of it because why would i? 

i came back early from work one day and heard really loud noises. the more i listened, the more i realized someone was definitely having sex. i instantly thought that my brother brought a girl home or something because the noises came from his room. his door was somewhat open so i rushed past it to get to mine only to be stopped dead in my tracks when i saw the back of my aunt, clear as day. i instantly felt like throwing up and managed to get to my room without them seeing me. in there i pretty much collapsed, contemplated my existence and the utter fucked-up-ness of my family (i knew it was fucked up, but not like this) then i just felt scared. i didn't know what it meant. i knew it was wrong, very wrong, but not what to do about it. i was also honestly super scared for their well being, especially my brother who had already been abused by my cousin as a kid (my aunt and mother were also abused by my uncles. this what i meant by fucked up family). i just kind of panicked. 

so the next day, my aunt went to work and i knew she would be there late. when my mom came home, i instantly told her i needed to tell her something. i sat her down and told her exactly what i saw and heard and she went ballistic. she stormed to her car and drove to my aunts job. my aunt never came back. 

my brother is now very upset with me. he told me that they're two consenting adults and can do whatever they want and that they weren't hurting anybody and that it was never my business. he has all of his stuff packed and he's planning on driving across the country to be with her tonight. my mom is still livid about it and told every single one of my family members. they all hate my aunt now and want nothing to do with her. this made me feel guilty because they used to absolutely adore her. 

now i'm stuck wondering if i made an asshole move by ""telling"" on them. my family is a mess, my mom who already had issues has seemingly gone off the rails, my aunt is all on her own and my brother might never forgive me.

edit/update: my brother left late last night/early this morning to be with my aunt. i tried to stop him but he was adamant that none of this was her fault and that he was the one who started it and couldn't let her deal with this on her own. he also said he's been in love with her since he was a kid. before he left, he told me that he isn't angry with me and apologized for being upset before. i told my mom he left and she had no reaction.",3

i was sitting at a gas station waiting for my cousin to come out the store with my dog in the back seat(husky if that's important). this man walks out and he was obviously intoxicated(i later found out from my cousin that the store owners wouldn't sell to him because of how intoxicated he was). the man starts walking towards my car and i reach over to lock my doors, the man opens my door before i get a chance to lock it and sits down in back seat and then closes the door. 
   
 at first i'm calm and ask him politely to get out of my car, the man just smiles at me before locking the door(using the little door lock thing). while i'm talking to the man my dog starts growling at him, i think he sensed that i was frightened.i jump out of my car and start screaming at him to get the fuck out of my car, shoo go away, this isn't your car, go away, etc. the guy doesn't get out and shoved my dog away from him(he was growling) and then my dog starts to attack him. my dog bit him 4 times before i was able to open the back door and pull him off.

"by convincing my entire apartment building a velociraptor was on the loose. this fu happened about 6 years ago, but i still think about it to this day. 

i was a student studying at a big university that had some large, luxury apartment buildings nearby for students to live in after their freshman year. in my building, there were around 400 apartments across 8 floors. i lived in one of these apartments with three roommates. modern gym, stainless steel appliances-- nice place. 

the fu starts with me not wanting to drink my face off for once on a saturday and wake up the next morning feeling like a train wreck, and instead wanting to have a ""wholesome"" night of fun. so instead of going out, i decided to post signs around the building that a dinosaur, specifically a velociraptor, was on the loose. harmless, right?

i spent some time putting this flyer(https://imgur.com/igbtdiw) together, purposely making it ridiculous by adding phrases like ""look out for the velociraptor mating call"" and ""ask security for repellent""-- i figured people would laugh about it. then i walked down to the apartment building's lobby to use their free printing and make about a hundred copies. finally, starting at about 9 pm, i spent the next two hours posting the sign on various doors around the building. 

for better or worse, it was a saturday, and people were getting drunk. about halfway through my adventure, as i was getting into the elevator to change floors, i saw a girl dressed to go out, makeup done, on the phone with someone, tears streaking her mascara as she struggled to convey to someone that there ""had been a velola-raptor attack and that she didn't know what to do."" me at the time thought this was really funny and kept going, and ultimately, after posting my hundred flyers, i went back to my apartment, watched some tv, and went to bed. that sunday i spent most of my time doing homework and not leaving my room.

on monday while in class my roommates' group text lit up with ""does anyone know what this(https://imgur.com/snosyew) is? it was a pile of 4 ""notices of lease violation"" suggesting someone had caused a ""disturbance on the property"" and that there would be a fine. me being fairly young, i got spooked, bounced from class, and biked to my apartment to take care of it.

i grabbed the notices and went to the leasing office. i'll shorten it immensely,  but the conversation can be summarized as such:

me: ""hi, i got these notices at my apartment today about causing a disturbance. i was wondering what it's about?""

apartment agent: ""oh, so it's you."" calls out to someone outside his office: ""get in here ""other apartment agent,"" it's the dinosaur boy!""

oaa, a guy trying too hard to be serious: ""do you know what you did last night?""

me: ""yeah, i just posted some funny and clearly harmless signs around that there was a dinosaur on the loose. also it was just me, so don't include my roommates here.""

oaa: ""okay, just you, but it was neither funny nor harmless. do you know how many calls security got? i had parents calling in demanding to know about the situation. we had students asking if there was a bunker to hide in.""

me, a little bewildered: ""uh, the sign said velociraptor. dinosaur. clearly extinct. it was just a joke. how did people take that seriously?""

oaa: ""look, *i know* velociraptors have been dead for over 10,000 years, but you caused a disturbance, and i still have to fine you.

*10,000 years*. fuck. there would be no winning with this guy. i asked him what the fine was ($100), ran back up to write a check, and paid it. (note: they apparently knew it was someone in my apartment who posted the signs by following security footage).

to this day i wonder how many fully functioning adults at prestigious universities think velociraptors are real, that they aren't dinosaurs but are instead a vicious reptile that people illicitly keep as pets or that you can go see at the zoo. i also occasionally wonder about the panic i caused, thinking about the girl who was likely on the phone with her parents, and all her parents probably heard were ""someone died -- on the loose -- don't know what to do."" 

i still laugh about it.

tl;dr: posted signs around my building saying that a velociraptor killed someone and was on the run. freaked out my drunk building and management got involved. got fined $100.",4

"update neighbour damaged their car pulling into my driveway - want us to pay for ""repairs"" ontario canada. original post - https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aadtxw/neighbour_damaged_their_car_pulling_into_my/

it's been about a week since the issue came up and i thought i would post an update.

i ended up going to speak with them the following day to tell them about the trespass. i also gave them a letter stating the same thing. it's just something i made up based on suggestions here and what i found on the internet. they seemed a little surprised and didn't say much other than i should expect to here from their attorney.

so far, we haven't heard from anyone lawyer wise.

for a short time, i felt like the problem was resolved as nobody used our driveway. this all changed yesterday (friday, exactly a week since the incident) when my neighbour pulled into my driveway as i was clearing ice from it. he smiled, waved and reversed into his driveway. i did manage to take a photo as i shook my head ""no"" at him. they used our driveway at least 2 other times in the evening after dark that we know about.

i called the non-emergency police number this morning to report the trespassing and the call taker told me someone would contact us soon. at this point, i think i would be surprised if the police did anything based on what i'll mention later in my text.

i have also pursued this in two other ways. first, the bylaw folks did get back in touch with me to tell me that there was no bylaw stating others couldn't use my driveway. they also said that i'm well within my rights to put anything i want in my driveway anywhere as long as it's not a permanent structure. i also learned that blocking my driveway from the street is not permitted and that anything within 1.5m on either side of the driveway is considered blocking. bylaw said the damage to the car is a civil matter and has nothing to do with them (not surprised there).

lastly, i tried to find out if i own the driveway all the way to the road. this has been an exercise in frustration to be honest. right now, the only thing i know for sure is the following;

>city right-of-way

>this term refers to the city-owned portion of a piece of land.  it is very often wider than the road and sidewalks that may abut your property and can extend to a considerable extent onto your property.  the city maintains a right-of-way wider than the width of the road in the event that a road widening becomes necessary at some point in the future.

>notwithstanding this, a property owner is still responsible for maintaining the city-owned portion of their land, with respect to matters such as grass cutting and snow clearance.  the exact extent of the city's right-of-way can be determined through a plan of survey.

this leads me to believe the city does own a piece of the driveway but i don't know how much and if this means my neighbour can use it. the fact that they began using it again a week after my visit leads me to believe they have found out that they are free to use it.

at this point, we are trying to decide if we drop it or go all in and hire our own attorney. someone from the planning department of the city is going to be calling us back next week (i hope).

thanks to everyone for all the great advice.

when i was digging in my glove box, he noticed my bag of pipe tobacco. he asked what it was, and i told him it was flavored pipe tobacco, and we had a short and friendly conversation about that. he then asked if i had anything illegal in my truck. i told him no, and gave him free reign to search my vehicle, to which he declined. 

after i handed him my registration, he was patient while i loaded my insurance app, and then he noticed that i had recently moved, and my insurance/license addresses were different. he told me that is a citable violation, and i should get it changed immediately. however, he did not issue that violation. 

while writing the ticket he asked where i work, and what time i had to be there. after i had answered, he responded ""i'll try to get you out of here as soon as possible.""

"an unauthorized $3k tuition charge appeared in my checking acct. i graduated 2.5 years ago. the school is attempting to limit their liability. anything i can do?. hi everyone,

i posted about this yesterday (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/9439ff/my_checking_account_was_compromised_and_its/)and didn't get too many responses, although luckily most of my financial issues have been resolved thanks to my mom's help.

a short version of what happened: a 3k+ charge showed as pending in my checking account from my old university (**edit to add:** i didn't recognize at first that it was from my university and thought it was a random fraud as it didn't explicitly state the university name in the ach debit description, and i graduated in 2016). i filed a fraud claim and my bank is in the process of investigating and closing my checking account. i called the university student accounts division and they have no record of that charge amount anywhere in their records for the past 2 weeks. the charge just appeared in my pending transactions overnight, and looked exactly the same (same name, same origination id, even the exact same dollar amount) of the tuition payments i made in oct/sept of 2015. i never used autopay to pay tuition and manually entered my account and routing numbers for each of the two semesters i paid tuition via e-check in 2015. i never ever authorized that they store my account/routing number.

i'm wondering now about the repercussions of my account and routing number still being on the school's servers, and them debiting my checking account without any warning, authorization, nothing.

i've spoken to the student accounts manager, but it seems the school is on lockdown mode to limit their liability, and they sent me back a very generic response. **is there anything i can do?** i'm wondering if there was a security breach on their side and while i will be protected as my checking account is being closed, other students may be at risk also. the debit would have been cleared if i hadn't called the fraud department as it apparently raised no red flags.

**edited to add:** no one at the student accounts office is picking up the phone and i am not getting an email response either.

**second edit:** i've just had a long conversation with the school's account manager and someone from their account processing department in the treasury office, and they were actually very kind. apparently this has happened to many, many students in the past week and they are working hard to track down the error and prevent it from happening again. they've also offered to pay for any fees or anything i'll incur due to having my checking account shut down which is very kind of them. it unfortunately won't help that i can't access $6k of my own money (the $4k in my frozen checking account and the $2k direct deposit that bounced today) for the next two weeks, but they are doing what they can. special thanks to u/reallygene for letting me know that ach blocks exist!!

**final edit:** thanks everyone for your responses, i read through most of them and some had very helpful suggestions moving forward. i**f i had known at first that it was the university making the charge and that it was just a billing error, i would not have initiated a closure of my account due to fraud**. however, i didn't recognize the charge until a few hours later (and combing through transactions from 3 years ago) and even when i did, i talked to the student accounts manager who said 

a) he had never heard of a the description associated with the charge 

b) they had no record of a charge in that amount being processed in the past few month and 

c) that they hadn't accessed my accounts for over 2 years (leading me to think it was truly fraud or a security breach for over 30 hours.)  

the chase fraud team highly suggested closing my account because they would not be liable to return the funds to me if i kept this account open and this happened again. thus my checking account is being closed. currently it looks like all my funds are back, but i will need to visit a branch office to open a new, verified account and transfer said funds. so everything is ok, but moving forward i'll have 2 checking accounts and space out the bill payments over the entire month. thanks everyone!

"by not correcting my cashier when she mistook me for a coworker.. today was my first day off work since friday last week and i decided to run some errands. while i was out i ducked into a grocery store to buy a drink and noticed that the store's eftpos was down. the cashier told me that they could still process the sale, i just had to sign for it and the money would be taken out once it came back online. 

on my drive home i realised that i had forgotten to pick up stuff for dinner so i swung into the grocery store closest to my place, which happened to be the same brand as the one earlier. i got my stuff with no problem and went to line up at the conveyer belt and this was where my fuckup began. 

i'm a person with anxiety so i always prepare something to say when i'm inevitably asked how my day is going. i knew that i was going to respond with ""good, it's been pretty busy although i had a sleep in this morning since i was at work so late last night"". i got up to the cashier and said hello, she looked at me in surprise and went ""oh, are you not working today?"" and i just panicked. this wasn't what i had prepared for. so my stupid brain decided to go with what i had already prepared and i said ""nah i was working late last night so i'm not in today.""

the second it came out of my mouth i wanted to hit myself. why didn't i just say that i didn't work there? sure i could correct her now, but i'm already in too deep. 

so we start talking about work. she complains about having a three hour shift and how it only works out as two and a half hours pay. for some reason i say that i'm lucky that i'm not working since it looks like it's a busy day. she asks me if i've heard anything about shaun leaving. i said that i heard he is. she was upset about that, he's a nice guy. i agreed, he's one of the good ones. i have no fucking clue who shaun is. 

i manage to lie my way through the conversation, mentally berating myself but also congratulating myself on my tremendous acting skills. we get to the point where i'm about to pay and what do you know, the eftpos is down.  part of my coping for anxiety is trying to make others as comfortable and happy as possible so instead of having her freak out over the system going down, i simply explain to her how to process the sale. information i only know because i was at the other store two hours ago! 

she looks at me and goes, ""well at least someone who works here knows what they're doing."" i laugh nervously. yeah...right. 

then she asks me for my staff card to scan for ""my"" staff discount. and of course i don't have a goddamned card. who do you think i am, an employee? luckily since i had only shoved my credit card into my phone case instead of bringing my whole purse i managed to come up with a lie about how i didn't have my full purse so i don't have my card. that's alright though, she can put it through on hers and i can sign it. 

i signed a name that definitely wasn't mine. is that illegal? probably not. i then picked up my bags and ran. didn't even say bye. i needed out of there. 

as i hurried away, i heard the guy on the register behind her turn around and go, ""did you know her?""

i don't think i can ever go back there. either i'd have to attempt to keep up the pretence or go back and own up to it and face the shame. so i think i'll take option three and avoid my neighbourhood grocery store like the plague. 

tl;dr: cashier at my local grocery store mistook me for a coworker. instead of correcting her my anxiety ridden brain decided to play along. i got in deep enough that i was teaching her to process sales. after she gave me her staff discount i fled the store and now don't ever want to show my face again.

edit: wow thanks for the silver! and because a few people have asked, yes i am in therapy. i have been on and off for almost ten years. i suffered from abuse for the majority of my life and while 99% of the time i'm perfectly functioning i do still have a compulsive need for people to like me because that it something i deem safe. hence my inability to rock the boat by telling her that she thinks i'm someone i'm not. that could end in an unsafe situation and in those moments it's not a risk i'm willing to take.

"i was just kissed for the first time!. i'm in my twenties and had my marriage was cut short after 2 years when i found out my wife was seeing other guys. honestly, i am really doing fine, and i was/am taking things one day at a time. after a bit, an old friend from college started talking to me.

she hurt her leg pretty badly and can't drive, and one day i offered to take her home from college since her rides bailed or something. i won't bore you with all the details (as much as i'd like to), but we wound up having a little impromptu date at a wine garden on the way back. finally, we get to her house, just sitting in my jeep talking about life. there is a pause in the conversation when a cat jumps on my hood. i look over and laugh and she kisses me. she is holding my face, and i'm a little shocked. i had no idea that was even on the table; so, i kind of pull back in surprise. and she just leans forward and kisses me again... it was amazing. after all the drama of a divorce, this moment really makes that bitter pill seem not so nasty. 

i know it sounds so cheesy, but i have always been the initiator of the first kiss in every relationship i have been in. this is the first time someone has kissed me; i guess the title is a bit misleading. i really needed to say something to someone. thanks reddit.

edit: you (lovely) mongrels keep asking for the aforementioned details; so, i included some in a comment on this post. have a wonderful sunday, reddit friends.",11
"people who raise their children genderless should be fined/jailed or have their child taken away. it's one thing to accept your child being transsexual, or whatever. it's another thing to confuse them just incase they're one of the very few people in this group (around .6 percent of adults in the united states). you alienate your children at such a young age from normal peer groups and hurting them in the long run. i can't imagine growing up and having to figure out what gender i was with no guidance from my parents when it's a far too complicated issue to be worried about as a small child.

edit- i've tried to respond to everyone but there's just too many people and i'm saying the same stuff over and over
i'm against extreme genderless parenting. it's okay to not only give your kid girly/boyish things, or not only have them wear girly/boyish. let kids play with what they want to play with. however, when you don't teach children their sex is connected to their gender, you're confusing young, impressionable children. why would you not use pronouns if the chances are your kids gender is going to be the same as their sex. you're confusing children making them worry about their gender identity when they're just kids. if you're kids talk about being transgendered and not feeling like their sex and wants you to call them something that's different. why treat your kid different just incase they're transgendered? it almost seems like while their hearts in the right place they subconsciously want them to be a different gender and push their kids towards that. let your kids be normal unless you have reason to believe otherwise. please.

"my 23m gf 25f has a disgusting fetish, and i don't know if i can handle it.. so, i met this beautiful woman about 7 months ago at an alumni function. we hit it off and honestly she's everything i could ask for. i'm not sure if i'm still in the honeymoon phase, but so far everything is working out and she even moved in with me two months ago with no problems.

however, this past holiday season she started doing something gross. honestly, it's so disgusting i haven't even asked my friends or family for help on this matter. on christmas eve, i woke up pleasantly surprised to see that she was cooking breakfast. but, when i looked at my scrambled eggs, it looked really really sketchy. it looked way too moist. my gf told me she used a fancy cheese which is why it was extra moist and smelly. i believed her and ate it. the texture was absolutely horrendous, but taste-wise it was fine. she beamed and started planning our holiday. 

then on new year's eve, we were cuddling and doing couple things. she brought strawberries and whipped cream. we did some fun with the whipped cream and she fed me the strawberries. then she chewed up a berry and fed it to me. i thought it was weird, but i was so horny i didn't mind. we finished the rest of the berries in the same manner, and the subsequent sex was amazing. 

but... now she's starting to chew her food and feed it to me. sometimes not in a sexual manner. steak, chicken, salad, eggs, etc. it's so disgusting. when i tell her to stop she starts crying and says i don't love her enough. all of our fights were about this issue. i eventually eat some and its so gross. i recoil whenever i think about the texture. 

help??? i thought maybe she needs to talk to a therapist or maybe i should contact an ex of hers to see if he went through something similar. she is perfect for me except for this one issue. 


--**update**-- 
so in the comments below, apparently her saliva started fermenting/digesting the eggs for me. this is probably why it had a sour smell. also, she's very attractive and needs constant validation. she makes me eat her regurgitated food as ""proof"" that i love her. besides this, she's honestly my ideal partner. i don't want to throw this away. i will be meeting with an ex of hers tomorrow. will keep you guys posted.

"reminder that you can negotiate your medical bills even with insurance!. i got a $756 medical bill in the mail for a ct scan and an er overnight stay. i already have insurance and they covered around $1200 of it.

i am in ~$3000 worth of credit card debt and the minimum monthly payment that the hospital was asking for was ~$250. this is about the amount i put down on this credit card debt each month. because of this, it was seriously going to hurt me in how fast i could pay off this debt.

i had read about calling up the hospital's billing department and negotiating the debt, so i went ahead and gave it a try. the conversation went as such (h = hospital, m = me):

> m: ""hi, i received a bill for $756 in the mail and that seems outrageously high for the services i was provided. the state average for a ct scan is roughly ~$108 versus your charge of $966...""

>h: ""we have never charged $108 for a ct scan. your bill is itemized for those services correctly. will you be able to make your payment?""

>m: ""well, i'm not going to pay this. this is absolutely too high.""

>h: ""well, what can you afford to pay?""

>m: ""listen, i'll pay 20% of this bill *right now*, if you write off the remaining 80%.

>h: ""alright, please hold for a moment so i can run this by a few people.""

i waited on hold for about five minutes before they came back on the phone.

>h: ""hi, so that's acceptable for us. if you agree to pay $151, we will waive the remaining $605. does that sound good?""

>m: ""that's perfect, thanks!""

i went ahead and paid over the phone, and checked my online account and the remainder was indeed waived as a ""charity adjustment""!

this does work people, all you need to do is ask. next time, i might even try 10-15%!",10

she said, ""i have a praise.

two months ago, my husband, tom, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. the pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him.""

(you could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagine the pain that poor tom must have experienced.)

""tom was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain.""

we prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of tom's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place.""

(again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirm uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on tom.)

""now,"" she announced in a quivering voice, ""thank the lord, tom is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.""

(all the men sighed with unified relief.)

the pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.

"for wanting another child?. throwaway because i'm sure some people will find this controversial and i don't want it tied to my main.

when my wife and i got married we agreed that we would have 2 kids unless both were girls, then we'd have a 3rd to try for a boy. i'm a guy's guy and i grew up with only brothers so i feel strongly that i want a son to bond with. that's not to say that i don't love my daughter equally. i just want to raise someone to follow in my footsteps with sports and girls and stuff. after some convincing, my wife agreed to this but said that if the 3rd kid was a girl, we'd stop trying. anyway, we ended up having one boy (8 years old) and one girl (5 years old). this background is important because you need to know that having a 3rd kid was something that was on the table.

last month, our son told us that he likes boys. this is totally fine, i'm not a homophobe, but i'm starting to feel like i want to have a 3rd kid so we can try to have a straight boy. i love my son more than anything and i wouldn't love a straight kid more than him, but at the end of the day i wanted to be able to bond with one of my kids over traditional masculine stuff, which includes women. 

my wife doesn't think that this is a good reason to have a 3rd kid. she said that she would be open to having a 3rd kid but that she finds my reasoning disgusting and she doesn't think she can go through with it knowing the reason for me wanting one. i don't think she understands how special it is for a father to have a son who can follow in his footsteps. am i the asshole or is she overreacting?",3

"by stabbing my husband while we were both horny. hey all,

happened 2 fridays ago not today but you know, formatting rules.

so my (f27) husband (m29) is a stay-at-home dad while i am a working wife. every morning, before i leave for work, my husband polishes my shoes.

since he has a submissive fetish, and i get some kinky pleasure out of this as well, what usually happens is that i would stand two steps up from the ground floor while my husband would kiss my feet and suck my toes. he would put my socks and shoes on, and then polish my shoes while i am wearing them, then, he would prostrate at the bottom of the steps while i would literally (albeit lightly) step on his head out the door.

&#x200b;

that, i had an event to get after work so i decided to spice things up and wear some high heels to work. in fact, i got them kind of sharpened as i was trying to imitate esme squalor (couldn't literally use knifes as heels as that wouldn't be practical).

so anyway, my husband kissed my feet, sucked my toes, put on my heels and started polishing them. he prostrated as usual, and not wanting to place my heels on his head, i thought i would aim for his shoulder blade. unfortunately i missed and ending up stabbing the back of his neck

he started bleeding so i called 911 and he was taken to the er. i told the doctors that we were having a fight in which i stabbed him with my heel.

so they called the police and i was arrested for domestic abuse until my husband was discharged from the hospital and able to convince the officers what really happened. he was extremely embarrassed to do so, and the police kept telling him that men can be abused as well, etc... neither my husband or i have ever been this publicly embarrassed. i'm just glad that i wasn't literally using knives for heals

&#x200b;

**tl;dr. accidently stabbed my husband during our morning sexual ritual. he got hospitalized and i got arrested**

**edit 1: we are not a bdsm couple. yes he shines by shoes and prostrates to me. but i do not go around torturing him. it's not a bdsm type of submission fetish. more of a ""i wear the pants"" kind of submission**

**edit 2: i had stiletto heals. i wanted to be like esme and use a stiletto knife as a heal but that would also be impractical. so i decided to sharpen my heals instead. just like how one would sharpen anything else. by squaring out the corners and making them pointer. and moving the bottom square in so the part touching the floor is sharp edges. got a cobbler (yes they do still exist) to do it**

**edit 3: i do not have pictures of the heels. the police seized them and won't give it back**

**edit 4: if i made this up for karma, then why would i use a throwaway?**

"the new arthur episode with mr. ratburn getting married is unacceptable and ridiculous. how tf are the kids invited and currently in attendance of his wedding (which i assume was planned *months in advance* despite never being mentioned once prior), yet don't know who he's getting married to? what? this is lazy writing at its finest. 

the old arthur i knew and loved wouldn't do such a disservice to the show by throwing together a haphazard plotline overnight for a beloved 20-year-long character. mr. ratburn suddenly has a fiance? he suddenly has a jane lynch sister? also what happened to his personality? he barely talks now. he just stands around looking glitchy. he used to be a fully developed character; a hardass with a comedic undertone who was frequently misunderstood by the kids but ultimately showed them learning was important, etc. he had depth. he doesn't even act like mr. ratburn!

and what on earth kind of wedding was that? everyone abruptly sits down, someone plays the cello for 2 seconds, then they walk down the aisle and that's it? sure, i could see if it was a 60 second vegas wedding but it's clearly a formal affair. suckiest ceremony ever - at least show us some context or backstory! how did they meet? how long have they been together? delve into their relationship a bit - you can't just throw a whole freaking husband into a season premiere with no other lead up.

"because i'm furious that my sil tattooed my kids' names on her body?. *edit/info for clarification: i didn't cancel the vacation and won't. it just makes me want to not see her. 

i  think it's disturbing that my sister-in-law, who has a long-distance, limited relationship with our children, had their names tattooed on her arm. she did not ask us how we felt, just posted a picture on social media once it was done.
she has no children of her own, but is still in her child-bearing years. she is not a close beloved aunt of my children- they see her once a year and talk to her briefly on holidays. they never talk about her or ask about her between those times. they like her well enough, but she likes to lecture them and attempt to parent them, so a little of her goes a long way. 

she is going to expect us to all oooh and ahh about this tattoo. i have nothing nice to say. i am not flattered, i feel violated. i feel like it glorifies tattoos (something neither i or their father have, though this isn't about tattoos in general-it's about tattoos of my kids' names. to each their own on tattoos). more importantly, it glorifies her relationship with our kids. she barely knows them, and doesn't spend time with them when we do visit. on our last visit, she sent our kids to mcdonalds with her friend and didn't join them. she later used a photo the friend took of my sons eating, and posted it as if she had been there. it's crazy. instead of the cost of a tattoo (this tattoo is huge btw), how about a plane ticket to visit the children you claim to love so much? she talks about my children taking care of her when she's in a nursing home... why would they? they will be busy with their own families, and taking care of their parents!

i was so mad when i saw the tattoo that i told my husband i wanted to cancel our upcoming vacation to see her (and their grandparents). i have been taking my anger out on him, which is probably unfair but i feel his lack of communication with them leads to this kind of crazy. because i think tattooing my kids' names on her body is weird? am i supposed to feel flattered? i feel like if anyone is going to tattoo my kids' names on their body is should be me or my husband!",3

"i 27 think my dad late 50s is a pedofile and i've ruined my relationship with my sister 32 beyond repair.. i don't know why i'm posting this, but i have to get this out and tell someone or i think i'm going to go certifiably insane. i can't sleep because this is keeping me up. 

the last few months its like a switch has been turned in my head. i'm getting fuzzy memories. i think they are memories at least. however they aren't clear and sort of feel like a dream at times. part of me really hopes they aren't real. i think all started because my dad has repeatedly brought up my sex life with my husband on multiple occasions over the last few months. in really creepy and weird ways to where i'm fake laughing and trying my hardest to change the subject because my dad and i have never talked about sex. i'm 27 and married, i don't need a sex talk anymore, that ship has sailed. him bringing it up at all, was just really out of place for our relationship and for some reason made me extreamly uncomfortable.

one memory is where i'm about 7 or 8. i'm home sick from school and in the garage with my dad helping him with stuff. i'm talking about a boy i like at school. my dad asks me if i've ever french kissed anyone. i'm confused and don't even know what that is. to put it lightly, he proceeds to teach me how to french kiss. 

heres the thing though, i filled in a lot of blanks above. its like peices are missing from my memory. i don't remember exactly how old i was but i remember, crystal clear, i was home sick because i had a test i didn't study for and faked not feeling well that morning. i also don't remember him kissing me, at all. i remember him asking if i had french kissed anyone pretty clear but after that its like the rest of the memory is gone. but somehow i *know* he taught me how to french kiss after he asked me that. i get a sense of feeling very uncomfortable whenever i get to that part of the memory. 

my sister is the black sheep in our family. she got pregnant in highschool, dropped out, got into drugs pretty bad, and has been in and out of rehab/mental institutions her whole life. shes 5 years older then me. i tried helping her when i got old enough to get over my childhood mad-ness. my parents drilled it into me after she got pregnant and dropped out that she was the problem. i believed them for so long. then i got older, got out of my parents house and realized life is not black and white. she wasn't a bad person, she was going through a bad time. i *tried*helping her. but she burned me too many times and eventually her lies and manipulation made me cut her out of my life. 

a few years ago she came out to everyone in my family saying my dad molested her. by this time i hadn't talked to her in years. my dad works a high profile job, an accusation like this would basically ruin his career. she had lied to me my whole young adult life about almost everything that it was easy for me to not believe her. i saw my dad as my hero, there was absolutely no thought in my mind that he could do the things she said he did. 

until a few months ago. 

another memory i have now is when i was younger, about 5 or 6, and its sort of like a ""this is how it always was"" kind of memory. its not of a specific time but its like i'm re remembering something that was really common and happened a lot. my sister and i shared a room and at nap time she was always be in her bed next to mine when i fell asleep, but when i woke up she wouldn't be in the room. whenever i'd go and find her she'd be dazed and not in a good mood. it makes sense. in her accusations she said he would always wake her up at nap time and they'd go to his bedroom. 

i don't know what to do. i didn't believe her. part of me still doesn't want to believe her even though i know thats really fucked up. ive not spoken to her in years. my whole outlook of my dad being my hero is tainted and smashed. i've been ignoring his calls these last few months, avoiding him. 

i ache for my sister. she must have went through something so tramatic and her way of dealing was the drugs. i know abuse can tear people up and cause so much mental illness problems. i feel horrible because i thought her crippling anxiety that caused her to loose every job i got her was her way of getting out of working when in reality it was her way of dealing with the abuse. i feel lucky that my mind somehow blocked it out and i really want the memories to stop because i feel like if they continue i'm going to be just as messed up as she was/is. 

i don't know what to do. do i call her? tell her i believe her? do i apologize? do i throw open the roof and accuse my dad? or do i do what i really want to do and ignore all of this like it never happened. i know, fucked up, but i wish it never did. i don't want these memories. i miss my dad. i don't want to ruin his life by accusing him of anything that i'm personally not 100 percent sure of but i also don't want to let my sister continue to suffer and think no one believes her. and, my dad has always been very friendly to kids. most people think hes just good with kids. but now, i think its because of this. i haven't been home in awhile, but if hes anything like he was when i was there he's making friends with the neighbor kids. if i don't say something am i forcing another kid to be abused? was it just his own kids he did this to or did he move on to other kids when we grew up and moved out. i can't be sure of course but in the back of my head its like, i know he was too friendly to the kids in our neighborhood in light of my recent memories. it wasn't normal. 

i'm sorry that was so long. i can't tell anyone about this, i'm scared to even tell my husband because i know saying it out loud will make it all true. i know my husband would support me in anything i wanted to do, but telling him seems like this big chore that i keep putting off because i don't even know what i want to do. i'm not sure how to proceed here. i don't even have my sisters number, i don't even know what i would say. what if its too late and she doesn't care that i believe her. i've heard she's doing better and had been in a good place this last year, what if me bringing this up again hurts her progress? maybe she's gotten past some of it and bringing it up will only hurt her? what if no one believes me like no one believed her? 

i feel like i'm just rambling and going on about what ifs at this point so i'm going to end here. i don't even know if reddit can help me with this. i know i need to see a professional but i'm scared to remember more and i'm scared to talk about this. 

edit: it's been a rough morning. my husband knew something was off when he woke up. i told him. he agrees i need to see a professional which, with my insurance could take weeks due to needing a referral since i can't just go see one. until then he thinks its a good idea to write down what i am remembering as i remember it. 

we've agreed not to tell my sister about this until i establish some sort of new relationship baseline. her and i don't even know each other anymore and to jump right out with this, well it would be too much. i plan to reach out to her and slowly start talking again if shes willing. when the time is right, after i've talked to a professional, i'll bring it up to her and go from there. 

thank you all for the advice. i think just writing this out helped me see what i needed to do.

"update i 29m found my girlfriend 32f has a soft strap-on dildo that she's been hiding from me. i think she knows i found it. what do i do?. last post: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu9h99/i_29m_found_my_girlfriend_32f_has_a_soft_strapon/

a lot went down in the last few hours. less dick jokes this time round, because now i'm over the ""surprise floppy dong!"" aspect of it, it's turned out a lot more serious than i expected.

(for what it's worth, my girlfriend told me to still call her ""she"" at all times except when dressing male, so i'm still going with that for this update post)

i fell asleep not long after the post i made last night. got up around 2. headed downstairs to get my 2pm ""breakfast"", and gf was down there in her pyjamas, with a cup of tea and her phone. good a time as any to address the elephant in the room, i thought.

it was awkward as hell. i started off with ""hey"", got a dead silence, and followed it up with something like ""sorry, i was looking for my uniform shirt yesterday, but that drawer's really none of my business, you can keep whatever you want in there, it's all good"".

tried to keep it as non-specific as i could. if she didn't know i'd found it before, she definitely knew now.

she just sort of nodded in response to me. then she apologised for not being in a talkative mood last night, and started telling me about her day. but it came off really strained. i could tell it was on her mind, and she kinda trailed off after a bit.

eventually she told me to come upstairs with her. i thought she just wanted to talk somewhere more private (it's a shared kitchen, we're living in a family's spare room). but no, she went into our room and showed me everything.

she crossdresses. that's specifically how she referred to it, not trans or drag king or anything. she wears the dick (the packer, as the comments informed me last night), and the crop top she'd had it wrapped in flattens down her boobs. and it turns out she's been going through my drawers for a lot longer than i've been going through hers, because she got a shirt and some comfy tracksuit pants from my drawers and put them on. she has long hair, so she ties it up and hides it under a flat cap that she had in another drawer.

after she'd shown me all of this, basically in silence, she looked at herself in her mirror for a bit. different angles and stuff. to me she still basically looked like herself, with a flatter chest and different clothes, but she seemed fascinated with how she looked now.

she kept glancing over at me to see my approval, and i smiled back. tried to look as reassuring as possible. i noticed she'd been pretty shaky putting things on. when she was looking at herself in the mirror, i went over and put a hand on her shoulder supportively, which basically seemed like it was what pushed her over into starting to cry.

then she broke the silence and just couldn't stop talking. she's been crossdressing secretly for the past couple of months, she was so worried about what i'd think. she insists she's not transgender, she just likes to crossdress sometimes, it makes her feel good and confident. also insists it's not a sex thing. just for fun.

i kept saying ""it's okay, it's okay, don't worry"", mostly because i didn't really know what to say. i ended up hugging her as she sobbed on the bed. she calmed down eventually, and told me ""thank you"", because she said she had no idea how i'd react.

she asked me how she looked (while still all red-eyed from crying). i just said ""you look great"" and smiled, and she hugged me again. ""you don't mind me wearing your clothes?"" ""yeah, no worries!"" i guess she was always a lot more careful with my stuff than i was with hers in my rush yesterday. we didn't really talk much about it, i just asked a few simple questions like if she wanted me to refer to her with different pronouns when she was dressed like this (i know that's usually a trans thing but i thought i'd check anyway).

we didn't do much else after that. she eventually got on her phone again, i got on my laptop. the two of us hanging out together doing our own thing, just as we usually do, only with her in different clothes. i basically got my mind off it for a bit, and then i had to go to work again not long later. wrote most of this on the bus to work.

i've been thinking back to when i said she looked great. she basically just looked like herself still. a few different clothing choices didn't transform her into a different person for me, and they definitely didn't transform her into a man. it was basically just the same as she always is, for me. but i realise it was a lot more significant for her, and i respect that. but also i don't want to pretend it's a mindblowing shift in appearance for me, too.

also i was thinking... i think i'm glad she's not trans. is that bad of me to say? i love and respect her but i realised when thinking about it last night, if i ever did see her as a man, things would be really different for me. i know i was going on about pegging in the last post, but ""girl with strapon"" and ""someone who straight-up looks like a man"" are really two different things for me, and i don't think i really have the wiring to have feelings for her as a man. but i'd do my best to be supportive anyway, because i don't want to stop her being the person she is. i'm really hoping the situation stays where it is and never comes between us. if it did... i'd have to let go of her as a girlfriend. let her find somebody right for her.

tl;dr: i don't have a problem with her crossdressing, but mainly because she still just looks like a woman to me and i barely even register it as crossdressing. should i tell her this? i think she'd take it badly after the emotional moments earlier.

i have to go into work now, so i won't be responding for a bit. thank you for everyone who's offered support, in public or private.",7
"my 28f boyfriend29 intensely flirted with a ""good friend"" of his on instagram while we were on vacation together. we were planning on moving in together soon. we've been together for one year and prior to this happening, this was the happiest and healthiest relationship i've ever had. after having been in several long term relationships, he's the only one that i've ever truly wanted a future with. i'm also his first love. there was a lot i had to teach him about being a good partner, but i respected him, because when we had our issues, he listened and always showed me that he's willing to fix his side of things. i see him actually make changes to do so.

now i have never looked into his phone before and had never felt the need to. however, a couple days ago while he was texting someone, i noticed one of his recently used emojis was a flirty one he's never used with me. i just had a nagging feeling someone wasn't right and i brought it up to him later when he was dming a friend on instagram. when i asked to see his dms, he got really defensive. i saw this girl's picture and asked who she was and apparently she was a ""good friend"" from his home state. i told him to show me their convo and he got extremely nervous and refused to let me see. after threatening to leave him, he finally showed me. it was a very flirtatious convo which started with her responding to his instagram story of a picture he took during our vacation. he complimented her, saying she's hotter than he remembers and ""thicc"", told her to come visit him during thanksgiving weekend (she lives in another state) repeatedly telling her that he really wanted to see her and take her around our city. she was reciprocative with the flirting but didn't seem to take him asking her to come too seriously. he responded with ""a man can only hope"". convo stopped and then a couple of days later she messaged him again but there was no flirting and nothing brought up about their previous convo. 

after reading all this, i started packing up my things and broke up with him, i was shaking from anger. he started hysterically crying and begging me not to leave him, that this meant nothing, and he didn't know why he did it. i know he didn't physically cheat on me, but this hurts just the same. if he loved me as much as he claims he does, why would he have done it? we were in a great place, we were always so loving towards each other and supportive. 

he's been a mess since this happened and has been crying so much and hates himself for hurting me. he apologized so many times but has given me no excuses as to why he did it, that ""it just happened"". he even says he's not attracted to her and there were no intentions behind his words to her. he since messaged her with an apology for the flirting, that he shouldn't have done it and that they shouldn't talk anymore. he promises he will never betray me like that again and honestly my instinct believes him. but at the same time, i don't know how i should trust him again? can i please get some advice on what to do and maybe help me understand why he could have done this?",7

"one of the most satisfying things is upvoting a downvote.. i'm not sure why, but it gives me so much pleasure to upvote a comment that has 0 back to 1. sometimes i don't even read the comment before i do it.

when the post is alive and someone downvotes, i get enjoyment from thinking how angry they get when i upvote. they were emotional enough to downvote the comment, so i know how emotional they get seeing it jump back up and ultimately cancel out their vote.

i imagine someone arguing in the comment section and refreshing the page to see the person they hate on a small post has gone back to one and there is nothing they can do, their vote has already been cast.

sometimes when 2 people are arguing, and both have 0s (from downvoting each other), i will choose one to upvote just to make another mad and feel like they are losing the argument. i don't usually choose based on who is right, but who is more emotionally invested in the conversation.

my husband said, ""oh... when you do, try not to disturb the spider that lives behind the toilet.""

me, ""wait, what?""

my husband was surprised i hadn't noticed it yet.  ""just be gentle, okay?  he's not hurting anything.""

my husband is over 50.  he grew up hunting in a small northern town.  he's practical and tough and used to strictly maintain an ""8 foot rule"".  which is something he made up that states any spider who descends below 8 feet from the floor has forfeited all protections and may be killed outright.  he's killed plenty of spiders who got too close to our living space!

but, this one he's decided to keep.  it comes out from hiding when he's brushing his teeth and waves tiny arms at him.  i think maybe it's being aggressive and guarding its territory.  my husband says it's  being friendly.

i asked him what if it lays eggs and we end up with a million million baby spiders.  he shrugged, and stuck a toilet paper roll in front of its hiding place to ""make him feel more comfortable"".  and now here i am, trying to figure out how to clean around the critter without bothering it more than necessary.

"by going on a date thinking it was a job interview. by sitting through an entire date thinking it's a job interview

so this happened in the past 24hrs. 
i'm a 19 year old male making my way through college, and also work at a restaurant to make ends meet. now you could consider me pretty smart except when it comes to social interactions, i can almost never pick up on little hints such as flirting. 

so yesterday was a pretty slow day at the restaurant and this middle aged lady (35-40) came in, she was the only customer we'd had all day, and as such i decided i'd be extra friendly and have a real conversation with her.

it's worth noting that she's very very attractive for her age, and she was very well kept as well.
during the conversation she mentions that she runs a property management/realtor business, and that she had just spent the day interviewing people for an assistant position she had open. but she hadn't found anyone worth hiring yet, then proceeds to ask me if i knew anyone looking for a job. 

now i'm happy with my job, the money is decent (could be better ofc) but i'd always wanted a desk job. so i told her i was actually thinking of looking for another job. she then proceeds to say that ""i look like the perfect young man for the job"" and that she would like to talk about it more when i wasn't at work. so we made plans to meet the next morning for coffee. 

now here's where my idiocy really becomes clear. 

im not usually a morning person and the idea of an early morning interview had me nervous, so i made sure i woke up nice and early and got dressed looking real spiffy if i may say so.

i show up to the cafe dressed formally with my resume in hand. and as soon as she spots me she greets me with a long deep hug. this is when i should've realized this wasn't a standard job interview. but clueless as i am i just figured oh shes friendly. 

we sat down and the conversation never once broached the subject of my skills, qualifications, or employment history. instead she mainly steered the conversation towards personal stuff like what are my hobbies, shared stories about her life etc... 

this whole time i'm thinking, oh she already knows where i work, and she's probably just looking for someone whose personality matches her's. because of course no one wants an assistant who doesn't get them. duh. 

now by the time we were wrapping up, 2 hours had past, and the whole time i'm thinking oh this interview is going really well. then as we stood up to leave the cafe, she gave me one more hug, and said she ""really did enjoy our date"" and asked if i'd be interested in coming over tonight for dinner. 

i froze for a second, did she just say date?!?

panicking as if the job was still on the line i quickly said ""sure that sounds great boss"" with two thumbs up and a dumb smile on my face.

i have no idea what i'm going to do...


edit: to answer all your questions, no i didn't sleep with her, yes she's very hot, turns out she's actually 52, no i won't be taking the job, yes i went over but because i didn't want to be a dick, i ended up explaining the misunderstanding she ""apologized"" and i left, she's tried texting me a couple times through the night, i still haven't responded.

"my neighbor abused his dog, so i dognapped it and took it to a rescue farm to live on.. no regrets: if you don't feel bad.

the person who lives directly across the street from me is a disgusting old fuck who is the epitome of the awful neighbor. he's the type that will call the cops if he sees a car parked more than a foot from the curb or if someone's grass is half an inch too tall for his liking.

he had a german shepherd that he kept outside 24/7 and tied to a chain. the dog had maybe a circumference of about six feet in which to roam because the chain was so short, and it always spilled the small bucket of water. i probably filled that water bucket more than the dog's owner did.

one day, i saw him grab the dog by the head, pick him up off the ground, and throw him at the wall of the porch because the dog had pissed on the walkway and not in the grass. i marched over to his locked gate, and began screaming at him to knock it the fuck off, lest i call the police on him. he told me to mind my own business, and dragged the dog inside. i decided right then and there that by hook or by crook, i was getting that dog away from that asshole.

i got in contact with a friend of a friend who runs a private no-kill shelter on a huge farm. she said she'd be more than pleased to take the german shepherd and not question where it came from.

i waited about a week for the next time he left the dog outside while he was gone. i walked across the street, cut the padlock on the gate with bolt cutters, and freed the dog. he bounded into my car, and i began the 90 minute trek out into the country to take the dog to his new home. he fell in love with that farm from the moment he jumped out of my car when we arrived, and the lady who runs the shelter absolutely adores him. despite his previous lot in life, he's a very happy and playful dog, and shows almost no lingering effects from his mistreatment.

by the time i got back to my place, the neighbor was home. he saw me pull into my driveway, and asked if i'd seen his dog. i didn't even look at him, and said ""nope"" before going inside, and letting loose with a supervillain chuckle.

the dog is doing great at his new home, and is back to a healthy weight. the neighbor seemingly forgot about him after a few days, as i haven't heard of him ask anything further about the dog. another neighbor told me that the asshole assumes the dog ran away. you know, because dogs are capable of cutting a pad lock and opening a latched gate =p

then your first date with daniel, the funeral home guy. your first date involved riding in his hearse. he told you he just had to transport a body to the funeral home and then you guys could go out, and you reluctantly agreed to ride with him. ten minutes into your trip, he had to slam on the brakes and the dead person+coffin comes flying into the front of the vehicle. i have marked that down as one of the hardest laughs i have ever had in my life, to date.

seven years ago you went to the doctor for the 100th time and they diagnosed you with lupus.
fast forward a few years and your liver started failing. then you tripped over your cat and fell and broke your hip. i'm sorry i gave you so much shit about that, but come on...you were 31 years old and you fell and broke your hip and had to have a hip replacement!

you went to a doctor in texas and got on a liver transplant list. in january 2018 you found out you were one of the next in line to get a new liver.

on tuesday of this week you were admitted to the hospital and put in icu because you had an infection in your blood.

on wednesday your body went into shock and your organs began failing.

on thursday at 12:22 p.m. you were pronounced dead. 

your 15-year-old son just messaged me on facebook **to see how i was doing.**

his mother just died, and he is checking on me. i hope you saw that, and saw how great of a kid you've raised. 

i'm at a loss right now. i've picked up my phone about 100 times to text you and then realized you were no longer there, and i've found myself wishing i was with you instead of here.

you were my best friend. i'll hold down the fort here until i see you again. 

edit: wow. i am blown away by all of your support. what started as me sipping on my third glass of wine and writing this just to get it off my chest turned into an overwhelming amount of support from all of you. i've cried on and off all day reading your comments and your stories. i love all of you, thank you so much. and i will keep in touch with her son to make sure he's okay.

"an engineer was crossing a road one day, when a frog called out to him and said, ""if you kiss me, i'll turn into a beautiful princess"".. 
he bent over, picked up the frog, and put it in his pocket.
the frog spoke up again and said, ""if you kiss me, i'll turn back into a beautiful princess and stay with you for one week"".
the engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled at it and returned it to the pocket.
the frog then cried out, ""if you kiss me and turn me back into a princess, i'll stay with you for one week and do anything you want"".
again, the engineer took the frog out, smiled at it and put it back into his pocket.
finally, the frog asked, ""what is the matter? i've told you i'm a beautiful princess and that i'll stay with you for one week and do anything you want. why won't you kiss me?""
the engineer said, ""look , i'm an engineer. i don't have time for a girlfriend, but a talking frog - now that's cool"".",0
"i'm black. i'm not apologizing for that.. i'm a black man. i'm about 6'2"", average build. nothing too fancy. i think i look normal, not intimidating in the slightest. i grew up in a middle-class neighborhood. my parents were blue collar workers, but provided for me and my sister. we were taught manners, said our pleasantries. i got detention once in fifth grade because i was late to class because i spilled paint in my art class and had to clean it up. but that's it, that's the worst trouble i've ever been in in my life. 

i am a surgical resident at a hospital you've probably heard of. i was educated in a top 10 university and went to medical school at a pseudo-ivy league institution. i have had a great life. i've made sure of it. so have my parents. 

of course, i have noticed racism throughout my life. i have been pulled over and the officer has never given me a clear answer. sometimes, they will straight up lie and tell me that i was speeding when i know i wasn't. once, i was stopped and frisked. the officer apologized and told me that i matched the description of a criminal-on-the-run in the area. the only description was ""black man, average build."" i never reported this, but i always remember it. 

today, i was leaving after a 26-hour shift at the hospital. i'm in my fourth year of residency and the hours get longer and longer, but i'm almost done. today was particularly grueling, because i found out that a patient i have worked with since the start of my residency is now deemed 'terminal' and will be moved to hospice care. it sucked, it broke my heart. it was like four years' worth of work had been erased. 

as i was walking across the parking lot, a young man—younger than me, maybe twenty-five—leaned out of his car and called me the n-word. it was loud enough so people could hear. people stared, most in shock. others picked up the pace to get away from the earth-shattering embarrassment unfolding. 

i stopped and looked at him. the man didn't get out of his car, but he made sure i saw him. the sneer on his face, it grew into a piercing grin. he started mimicking the sounds of a monkey. he called me the n-word again. people continued to stare. my mouth fell open. the guy mocked my expression; he feigned behavior like one of my patients suffering from severe mental retardation. he was trying to show me how he saw me. 

a lot of things were on my mind in the forty-five odd seconds i was standing there. i wanted to walk up to the man and list off all my accomplishments. i wanted to tell him how, in eleventh grade, i won a science fair by creating a more efficient way for our school's agriculture club to conserve energy. it took me to a national conference. 

i wanted to tell him about the first time i fell in love. i wanted to tell him about the guy who made my heart beat so fast that i thought it would explode. this guy, he was tall, his smile was dopey and his eyes were light. just the thought of him took away the painful feelings that this man was bringing to me. 

i wanted to tell him that i'm a good person; that i volunteer, i save lives, i work so people like you get a chance to survive and carry on being the hateful people you are. 

but instead, i walked to my car. the man called me the n-word about five more times, laughing so hard i thought it was certain he would lose consciousness. 

i sat behind the wheel for a very long time, maybe ten minutes, processing. i was angry at the man, but also at the people that didn't say anything. i was angry at myself for not saying anything. 

sometimes, i just feel alone. who i am, simply the color of my skin, makes me the target of hate from people that i will never even know. i truly try to love and understand everyone, so when one person returns that with malice and ill-will, it's a lot to take in. 

i don't think anyone will read this, but i just wanted to tell you all about my day. i want to put this out into the world. i want to let the internet know that black people are good. black people are strong, capable, smart. black people are resilient. i'm proud of my blackness. i'm proud of my coarse hair and thick lips. i'm proud of my body that is subject to ridicule. i am proud of who i am, what i have been through. i am proud of my ancestors who were slaves and now i am their wildest dream. 

black people can be bad, too. black people can be murderers and thieves and rapists. black people can be everything—except human, apparently. i just want to be acknowledged as a human. i want to be seen as a human. i want to be known. 

i love my black body. i'm tired of having to explain that pride in my black body is not hatred for any other race. i'm tired of worrying that i may be shot driving to work. 

i don't hate police. i don't hate white people. i don't hate anyone. 

but, god, i love me. and i want that to be enough. ",11
"brother exposed to my extremely religious family, out of revenge, that i'm not muslim, and has ruined my life. but some good came out of it.. i'm a 21 year old college student.  

&nbsp;

older brother has known i'm not muslim for a while, and we come from an extremely religious family. we got into a fight a month ago and, to exact the dirtiest possible revenge against me, he called my parents and told them everything: how i drink occasionally, party and befriend women (how awful, right?), and don't believe in god. 

&nbsp;

now my family has disowned me; my mom has been crying for the past few weeks, dad told me on the phone to never: come back home, speak to my 2 sweet younger siblings whom i love dearly, speak to my mother. also, my father was helping pay off my tuition and my housing, now he's cut me off. thanks to my brother. tried calling dad but he's blocked me, same with mom. won't let me talk to the siblings in any shape or form. had several terrible panic attacks and frequent mental breakdowns. 

&nbsp;

anyways, went to a close friend's party 2 weeks afterwards. wasn't planning on going, but decided to go anyways after friend insisted i'd feel better; what'll you have it, i met a girl from malawi. we seriously hit it off, for the first time in 2 weeks had some mental clarity. i got her number, and we went on a date the next day. we were going back to her place, then my brother called and humiliated me; somehow he knew what i was doing, and i've no idea how (if anyone has any idea how this could be, please tell me, i can provide more info privately).  

&nbsp;

after being screamed at and told i was a piece of shit, i hung up and tried to tell her what happened, but instead broke down heaving and crying in front of her. she didn't say a word, put her arms around me, and let me sob on her shoulder while patting my back. keep in mind this was the second day since we'd met. 

&nbsp;

she wasn't weirded out about the incident at all, and was so unbelievably gentle and compassionate about it all. since then, she's been messaging me every day sending me depressing 2meirl4meirl memes (well-meaning in a hilariously inappropriate way), keeping tabs on me and making sure i'm okay, inviting me over to her place and just cuddling and relaxing with one another. she's always smiling, optimistic for no reason, and just a dancy, awesome person. i'm so fucking relieved that someone so great made it into my life, and at quite possibly the most necessary timing possible. i have no idea what i'm going to do about my family that has derided and abandoned me, or my mentally abusive, manipulative helicopter brother, but at least i found someone to help me forget about it all. 

&nbsp;

edit: appreciate everything u guys are saying, for both the advice and the well-wishes. genuinely, thank you.  
not hating on islam, and my parents aren't shitty to be clear, my brother is. my parents are actually great, hard-working people. but muslim parents finding out their kid drinks and has a girlfriend is almost the equivalent of a white person's parents finding out their kid does heroin. i disagree with their reaction, but i can totally understand why they're acting this way.  
also, i meant this post as optimistic in spite of all the garbage that has been happening. i already have a plan for paying off my final semester, getting support from amazing friends, cutting off ties entirely with family (not with my younger siblings though), finding a job, etc.

"my grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (f24) to marry him (26). i don't know what to do, since i don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).. what do you do when you find out that someone you love more than anything in the world actually has some bad qualities? 

i was orphaned at 8, and my paternal grandparents took me in. they've raised me with the utmost love and care anyone could ask for, and i'm not lying when i say that they'd readily die for me - but most parents/grandparents are like that so you all know what i'm talking about. 

i've always looked up to them, and they've always set the very best examples for me; i've never ever seen either of them be unkind to a single soul, and they've always taught me to be that way too. 

recently though, i received the shock of my life when i saw their reaction to seeing my boyfriend (let's call him sam) for the first time (who happens to be black). i've never pegged them for racist people, and it was honestly unexpected. they tried to hide it but i could see it on their faces, that they didn't approve. 

since then they've just never liked the guy, and have always been like really nit-picky about him, criticising him about the smallest of things, always judging every single thing he says and does very harshly etc. i've tried time and again to convince them that he's a really good guy, that he loves me and cares about me but to no avail. 

well, he proposed to me, and it was the happiest moment of my life. when i told my grandparents though, it was clear they were upset. this time, unlike before, they didn't make excuses about why they didn't like him and just straight up confessed to having a problem with his race. 

at first i was incredibly pissed off, but i tried to reason with them and get to the bottom of why they felt this way. they think all black people are really similar to the way they're portrayed in racist stereotypes. this is all despite the fact that he's nothing like the racist stereotypes portray black people. he's a college educated, well dressed, well spoken man with a good job and a decent salary. this doesn't sway them. 

another thing that really confuses me is my mom, who was asian. they were apparently not only okay with their son marrying an asian woman, they loved her like she was their own daughter. they're also really good friends with my maternal grandparents, who are from korea/singapore. when my maternal grandparents found out, they weren't too happy either, and they were actually much more direct about it compared to my paternal grandparents. 

i honestly don't know what to do. my~~boyfriend~~ fiance has always sorta known that my grandparents didn't really like him, but he doesn't suspect that it's because of his race. 

my friends have all unanimously sided against my grandparents and said stuff like ""they don't get to dictate what you do with your life; tell them to either accept it or you'll cut them off permanently; just cut them off they're toxic people"" etc. 

while my grandparents are definitely in the wrong about all this, i can't even begin to fathom cutting them out of my life. they gave everything they had and more to raise me and give me the best life they could. they're the reason i am who i am today; they were always there for me, took care of my every need and always put me above themselves. how can i just abandon them like this? after everything they've done for me? 

on the other hand i can't imagine losing sam either. 

what do i do?

p.s i gave my maternal grandparents an earful, and told them straight up that they had no right to say the kind of stuff they said about sam, and that it was extremely rude. they tried to say stuff like ""we only want what's best for you"" etc, but i shut that shit down, and told them i won't speak to them again unless they treat him with respect.",7

after they're done sharing these links on facebook, they'll go tune into the latest *keeping up with the kardashians* episode, they'll watch the latest nfl game and buy their favorite player's jersey. they'll go buy the latest iphone supporting tim cook's salary, they'll go watch marvel's endgame and think chris hemsworth is wonderful. they'll listen to the latest hit single from migos on youtube. they'll go grab a burger from mcdonald's supporting steve easterbrook's salary. then they'll go back on facebook, read another article that a  90% tax on the rich can provide free college education, share it, then go back to watching the kardashians. it's selective envy.

"my best friend from kindergarten had cancer. i saw him at the grocery store completely healthy. for the two years i've been in kindergarten (i was crying when my mom wasn't around me) i had around 3 good friends. one of them, let's call him gabe, didn't have hair. my child brain thought that he was born without hair or he lost it in an accident. i didn't ask because i didn't want to be rude. 

we had fun. we caught worms and snails, played with hot wheels and legos, generally a great buddy to play with. after i finished kindergarten i never heard from him again.

after some years i realised that he didn't have hair because of cancer. i cried 10 minutes about it, that poor child of 5 already struggled with cancer...

and then, i found him at the supermarket, buying vodka. when i realised that this was gabe, i was shocked. it was weird and cool to see a childhood friend but this different. i talked to him about 5 minutes and found out that...

...he was getting the vodka to celebrate 10 years cancer free.

"if you use your body to attract a partner, then while in the relationship, let yourself go. it's entirely your fault if they lose interest.. i haven't personally experienced something like this, but i've seen it, in both sexes at that. why go through all that physical work get your ""mate"" and then get upset when they leave because you don't look like you did when they got with you? obviously all you had to offer them was a physical relationship of zero meaning. obviously the only option on the menu was ""body"". so don't get mad when they leave cause you took your only item off the menu. maybe try to become more of an interesting person before you start luring people in. 

edit: it seems i haven't made my point clear, i'm saying that you shouldn't build a relationship on sex, i'm saying that you should have something more to offer your partner than your body. also it isn't always clear what you are attracted to when you like someone. sometimes you just like them. so you can be in a relationship and not even know that you're only in it for the sex, or that you only have sex to offer. sometimes it's not always cut and dry why you both are together.

hope that gives a little more insight into the post.

"if i break the deal i made with my wife that she gets to name our male children, because she wants to name our son lannister of the got lannisters?. when we got married, my wife and i made a deal that she gets to name our male children while i get to name the females. our first child is a girl and i named her. our second child is a boy, so my wife should be the one to name him. however, when she told me that she wanted to name our son lannister after her favorite game of thrones family, i put my foot down.

i'd have no problem if she wanted to name our dog lannister, but this is our son. i asked her if she really wanted him to be named after a family of villains, but she just reminded me of our deal. she said she liked the lannisters and it was her turn to name our child, so he would be named lannister. we've had this conversation countless times and she refuses to budge.

the birth will be a c-section and i'm seriously considering filling in the paper work myself while she's still out. i know this might sound unfair to my wife given our deal, but wouldn't it be more unfair to my son if he was named after a family of power grabbing incestuous wine guzzling villains?

"a policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives.. to test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. ""this is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

the first guy answers, ""that's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"" the policeman says, ""well...uh...that's because the picture i showed is his side profile.""

slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""this is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

the second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, ""ha! he'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

the policeman angrily responds, ""what's the matter with you two?? of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! is that the best answer you can come up with?""

extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""this is your suspect, how would you recognize him? he quickly adds, ""think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

the third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""the suspect wears contact lenses.""

the policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. 

""well, that's an interesting answer. wait here for a few minutes while i check his file and i'll get back to you on that."" he leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""wow! i can't believe it. it's true! the suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. good work! how were you able to make such an astute observation?""

"i 32m sfound out my wife 30/f is having affair, and she doesn't know i know.. ***updated post***(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d36pwo/update_i_32m_found_out_my_wife_30f_is_having_an/)

edit: i have words for things now that i didn't before.i threw around the word ""narcissist"" without really knowing what it means. after reading *becoming the narcissist's nightmare* by shahida arabi, i am fully aware that she is a narcissist. ready to go down this rabbit hole? good. because i've been waking up at 3am to read it without consequence from my abusive partner. 

people have asked me why i did not get out sooner, or why i didn't realize she was not a good mom sooner, even judging me; saying my emotions were getting in the way of seeing her motherhood. well, here are some answers to that. i had/have something called trauma brain, and it started from childhood. my mother was extremely emotionally manipulative and a narcissist herself... she would be overly controlling and critical, throwing in overt and covert put downs and cruel verbal abuse, in addition to attempting to control everything i did. ""you don't have it as bad as i did, you wimp."" ""you could be so much better than you are if you worked as hard as i do"" ""you're going to that crazy school where they teach you the wrong things. come home and stop letting them poison you.""

from the book: ""for those who have been abused as children by narcissistic parents, trauma literally changes the structure of a child's developing brain which is extremely malleable during that time. dr. martin teicher (2006) pointed out the growing evidence that verbal abuse in childhood can change the way a brain is wired... there has been corresponding research that confirms that parental verbal aggression can in fact lead to changes in the brain."" (pg 160)

also from the book: ""for those of us who have experienced narcissitic abuse since childhood, many of us are familiar with the trauma bonds that can keep us locked in the vicious cycle of meeting and mating with narcissists."" (11)

that second quote is the first line of the introduction. i was hooked. 

there are biochemical bonds that are formed, especially in children, with victims to abusive people. 

""when trauma survivors encounter stimuli that remind them of their trauma... the amygdala (which processes emotions) reacts as if they are experiencing the same event."" (163)

in fact, the biochemical bond is so strong it can even affect memory in a phenomenon called ""abuse amnesia"". the reason that i can't always remember exactly what hurtful things my partner said to me is because my brain literally programmed it out. 

the chemicals my brain associated with my partner were: oxytocin, dopamine, cortisol, adrenaline norepiephrine, and serotonin. you may have heard of some of these: oxy, the ""feel good"" drug, the drug labeled ""dope"" - the drug that rewards us for certain behaviors, cortisol, the stress hormone, adrenaline and norepinephrine as the ""fight or flight"" hormones, and serotonin is the mood regulator. with an abusive partner, these rise and fall at any given moment. this leads to what is called a ""trauma bond"" - the result of intense emotional experiences that happen with our abusers. (162-175)

abused people are basically kept strung out on certain types of drugs and hormones for their entire relationship. my abuser has never ever had to show her true self because with narcissists, there is no true self. they rely on masks and fake emotions to get their way in any situation. 

""what abuse, throwaway? it can't really be that bad."" 

there is a cycle of narcissistic abuse, and it all starts with trauma bonding. the cycle is idealize, devalue, discard, destroy, hoover. the trauma bonds are located in the entire cycle, see if you can spot them. 

idealize means your partner fawns over you, often called ""love-bombing"". it's a honeymoon period with occasional insights into their narcissistic nature that good people often chalk up to human error. see, the narcissist only looks for targets who are prime candidates for emotional manipulation. my wife and i dated for three months before we decided to get married. she also made us having sex extremely frequent and completely mind-blowing, as that was something i hadn't experienced before and (we'll get to this later) she had a lot of practice. this idealization also causes most normal people to open up and be vulnerable with their partner, but this is just fuel for the narcissist's next phase:

devalue means that they will begin to pick on your insecurities, hopes and dreams, and character. once you're ""hooked"" on the dopamine and the oxytocin, everything is exploitable. the narcissist will employ covert and overt strategies of putting you down and making you feel worthless. i experience this with harsh ""jokes"" - ""my husband is such an idiot he forgot to unplug the coffee machine. he probably needed more coffee!"" oh, yeah, this happens in public too. i also got overt put-downs. ""you wouldn't have lost the tickets if you weren't so stupid. you can't focus on anything, you need to get your shit together."" ""why don't you ever think about me? you're so selfish."" she also attacks my support networks, calling my friend my ""butt-buddy"", and bombing my phone with text messages whenever i'm at his house (once a week to gather with friends and hang out). -even typing that made my cortisol rise, thinking about how my self-care could be interpreted as selfishness when it is not. your value plummets, setting you up for the next phase: 

discard is when the partner throws you to the curb, literally or figuratively. there is a moment when the narcissist gets tired of the ""supply"" (the attention an admiration of their ""trophies""... we say trophies because the narcissist only views people as objects that are extensions of themselves, like a purse or umbrella), and when the narcissist is tired of the supply, it will move on to a new one. in my relationship this looks like ""i'm done with you."" followed by excessive doting on our kids (her new supply). however, she gets worn out with them even faster, because while i can hide my emotions, the kids cannot. the other day one of the boys accidentally kneed the older one in the nose, and he started crying. she told him he has an ugly cry, and then he cried harder because he was called ugly and then my wife said ""what? i didn't say you were ugly, i said you had an ugly cry"". i cradled him in my arms and told him mommy didn't mean it. she dismissed us all and went to go chat with her boy toy in her bed. her favorite words, each and every day, are ""i'm done!"" then she emotionally abandons us, sometimes for days on end. this is another element of trauma, and this is what i'm worried about for our kids. what happens when this is the norm when i'm not there, and i can't help organize the pieces when trauma happens... i say pieces because trauma is literally a fracturing of the brain. oh yeah, did i mention that i've been relegated to sleep in the guest bedroom... because i went and helped a friend with a woodworking project after the kids were asleep?

then, destroy. the narcissist will use their posse to destroy the character of the abused person, making it seem like they are the crazy person. fortunately, in my situation, i have the support network where she does not yet. it takes time for her to establish, and she hasn't had enough of that yet. so, it's only 2-3 people right now. 

then, the most significant piece for me, ""hoovering"". ""this is when the narcissist, like a hoover vacuum, attempts to suck you back in to the traumatic vortex of the relationship. usually this occurs when the narcissist loses control of the victim and wants to regain control at the very moment the victim attempts to move forward with his or her life."" (51) i'll update the post with the way she tries to hoover back in after she's served. in the past, it's been with sex. after the conference, she had sex with me every night for a week. probably because she'd already hooked up with her current fling. i had no idea. 

now, what specific elements of abuse are we looking at?

buckle up folks because it's about to get very real for some of you. if your partner exhibits one or two of these, it may be npd, or it may be something else. but if they exhibit 7, 8, or 9... then dm me and we can talk about how the book says you can get out of that abusive relationship.  

toxic and abusive behaviors exhibited by someone with narcissistic personality disorder: 

1. being overly critical and controlling towards their partners, covertly and overtly putting them down through cruel verbal abuse - name calling, harsh insults disguised as jokes, contemptuous remarks about victim's appearance, lifestyle, line of work, or support networks. 

2. being physically and/or sexually abusive - coercing into sexual situations you aren't comfortable with, or even threatening to leave or ruin the victim's life if they do not comply with their wishes. 

3. engaging in hot/cold behavior (alternating through different hormones and drugs). this is the cycle of idealize, devalue, discard. they love you completely or they hate you. 

4. controlling every aspect of the partner's life - isolate the partner from family and friends and sabotage important life events or goals and aspirations. 

5. stonewalling into silence: any concerns about the relationship are met with silent treatment, ""i'm done"", or disappearance. 

6. triangulating victims with other love interests, comparing the victim to previous lovers and relationships. 

7. gaslighting - diminishing the abuse so that it doesn't feel real, deflecting accountability. 

8. smear campaings - slander the victim's character and reputation so that the abuse victim is left with no support network. they project their own bad behavior onto the victim. 

9. blameshifting - projection of malignant traits onto the victim so that they seem like the crazy person, and the aggressor appears just fine. 

that's all her to a t.

so, there you go. that's why i think she's an unfit mother and that's why it was so hard to realize i needed to leave. i had set a boundary (don't fuck other guys) and when she broke it, i realized all the other stuff that was off. narcissists don't have boundaries, and kids need boundaries, among all the other crazy emotional abuse they'll be subjected to with her. 


update: this week has been exhausting. i went to visit three lawyers and contracted with one. the papers are being worked on. it will take at least 24 hours to process, then they'll talk with me about a plan to serve her. 

you might be wondering how i secured a lawyer. well, i had not really had ties with my family. my dad and her are always at odds, and after one time that he didn't follow one of her rules with one of the boys, she lost it at him. she convinced me he was the toxic one and that he was bad for our relationship. so i hadn't really talked with him in like a year, even though i had convinced her to let him come visit once, she didn't say a word to him the whole time. 

i didn't know where else to go so i called him up. he picked up immediately, excited to hear from me, and this was our conversation: 

""dad, are you alone? and you promise not to freak out?"" 

""yes. what's the matter son?"" 

""...my wife is having an affair."" 

""oh throwaway... i'm so sorry."" 

my parents had gotten a divorce when i was 18. he really was sorry. i continued:

""dad i'm sorry."" 

""son you didn't do anything wrong."" 

at this point, i can't hold it all together anymore. i lose it, completely, in car, at the parking lot of the grocery store. i haven't sobbed like that since i was a child. i'm crying right now as i type this. 

""...yes i did, i'm so sorry. i've been awful to you.""

at this point, he starts crying too. and i sob more. 

""i'm just sorry you're in pain, throwaway. i'll tell you this so you don't feel like you have to keep saying you're sorry... i forgive you, but you haven't done anything to wrong me."" 

that's what love looks like. i'd been missing that feeling this whole time. this understanding that love makes sacrifices; doesn't focus on itself. and my dad has always loved me.  

then he told me he'd pay for whatever i needed, no matter how he had to do it. 


when this is all over, i'll have a proper update probably in a new post. i'm so tired of pretending, but i need to hold out for another week. my little ones, my conversations with my dad, my close friends and the support from y'all keep me going. i hope to have another update by next friday. wish me luck. 

also how long has there been a typo in the title?? sheesh. 



tl;dr: stuck in a relationship with a cheater. 

throwaway for obvious reasons and details changed, yadda yadda. 

it all started a few months ago. 

there was a continuing education experience that i was looking into attending for my job. however, when i brought it up, my wife expressed interest in also going because it was not only something she was interested in, but she hadn't been able to go in years because of our kids 2 boys, under 5 years. i know moms work really hard to care for their kiddos especially in those younger years. i work full-time so the moment i get home i take the kid's so she can get some rest. 

anyway this request seemed difficult but i decided i'd put my neck out for her. after all, she deserves to grow too, right? so i spend my proverbial chips asking my boss if she can go instead of me. surprisingly, he's actually ok with it after our frank and candid discussion, so she's able to go. i spend the week mostly home from work except when kids are at preschool, take care of the house and kids, and it's an awesome week. the boys and i get really close, playing all kinds of games and solidifying the bedtime routine... 

saturday rolls around when my wife is getting back, and she's over the moon. it seemed like the conference was really good for her. she came back with a lot of stories, as she loves to tell stories about her events. she informs me she's so happy she has friends she can talk to now and mentions that she'd like to go hang out with them now that she knows them. we live in a suburb, and they can all go hang out in the city together. i'm very excited for her as i haven't seen her this happy in a while. she typically experiences bouts of depression so this was amazing. 

fast forward a bit. she is getting ready to go hang out with them and she comes out from getting ready and she looks **cuuuuuute**. little tank top, shorts that make her booty pop. i comment and just says thanks. she'll be back in a while. 

she gets back and i ask how it went. ""good."" 

""...who did you hang out with?"" "" i don't know, people? you don't know them."" 

i brushed it off, but notes that she didn't tell me any stories. she always does that. 

she does this three more times. i start getting suspicious. she's getting distant and she's always on her phone. i start to put two and two together. 

well, i see she's on google hangout a lot. we know each other's passwords for accountability, and hers is already up on my phone whenever i log in (but i don't often log in). i start to think maybe she's cheating. then i have to convince myself she's not. she wouldn't do that. we've been married 9 years, we have two kids. she's over in the city right now with her friends, it's just a chill time to be herself. right? 

i tried so hard but i couldn't stop. i logged into google hangouts and there it was. one of the guys she met at the conference and her was at the top of the message list. all their correspondence was right there. 

it was vile.

things my wife and i had never said to each other. they were rendezvousing, just the two of them, to fuck. they were meeting up right now, at the ""usual place"". 

and when they weren't fucking, they were sexting like crazy. my kids were in the room while she was sending those messages. i almost threw up. my heart rate was at 175 at least. i felt every possible emotion a person could feel while sill having to care for the boys: make dinner, do baths, get ready for bed. i told them i was feeling sad, but not because of them, and that daddy might need a little more patience. they were amazing. 

that was 6 days ago. 

i've had to pretend, for 6 days, that nothing is wrong. 

i contacted a lawyer and i am filing for divorce. however, the retainer fee is way, way more than i or anyone in my family has. 

so i have to pretend everything is ok while i find this money. 

a couple nights ago she asked if i wanted to have sex and i said i had a headache. then i *actually* was sick to my stomach and almost vomited again. i can't have sex with her as the guy may not be clean and i don't want a vd. plus... it hurts to think about how she could do that. what did i do wrong?

i have no idea what to do. she's keeping up the charade just fine, but i'm cracking as time goes on. what should i do? i have to protect my boys from her... she's not stable. pathological liar, inappropriate conduct, and the kicker? 

we're in the middle of marriage therapy. 

what should i do?

edit: people are asking why i am concerned about my kids. good question.

when i was 22 i met her at a convention... much like this one. huh. it turned out she only lived like half an hour from me, so we started hanging out. found out that until recently, she had a fiancee. no big deal... that's totally normal for a 20 year old to have gotten engaged and ended it, right? she said he cheated on her. press x to doubt

she showed up after we'd been dating for a bit with a suicide note in her hand.

i took her inside and from that night onward, i didn't leave her side. i wanted to make sure she was safe. she would lock herself in the bathroom with razor blades and cut herself.

since the beginning of our relationship, and after we got married, she'd said she felt depression and thoughts of suicide at least five or six times.

she also has absolutely no impulse control (obviously), she is a narcissist (everything is someone else's fault, never her own), and she doesn't have any emotionally healthy behaviors with the children (yells instead of communicates, tells them ""i'm done"" instead of parenting and just leaves it to me).

my kids won't got to bed unless i put them down. i wake up with them every morning, and when they wake up in the middle of the night. i make and feed them breakfast, she sometimes makes them dinner (like she did last night) but usually she asks for fast food. which is unfortunate because she does cook really well.

all that and she lies about everything.

she's unstable and inconsistent, and kids need emotional stability and consistency.",7

"i'd rather have no children at all than a child with developmental or intellectual disabilities.. i don't have kids. i want them someday. 

i've talked about this with my girlfriend. i think by the time we are ready to have kids, it's likely that we can *choose* whether or not they are born with certain disabilities. or, if they're prone to them, make sure they aren't born with them. 

for example, she once asked if i would want a kid with down syndrome. i said no. i wouldn't love that child any less, of course, if there was no preventing it, **but** if i had to choose between having a child with down syndrome and no child, i'd choose no child. children are already a massive burden; financially, emotionally, and every-other-ally. add a developmental disability on top? not if i can help it. 

for context, my older brother (nearly 30) has an intellectual disability. our parents have always been awesome with him, but eventually they won't be around and he can't live on his own. likely, i'll be his guardian. and that's okay, i love my brother, but if i were my parents, having seen what they've sacrificed and do for him every day, i would have chosen not to have him. 

is that bad of me to say? am i an asshole? maybe. but it's my unpopular opinion. 

______________________________________________________________

edit: i haven't even mentioned the hardships for the hypothetical child, but many commenters have with whom i agree, so i'd just like to mention that point as well. 

edit 2: i want to clear something up for everyone; and i said it in the original post. **i wouldn't love my child any less** if i had one with disabilities. loving a future child and being more heavily burdened by its existence aren't necessarily mutually exclusive feelings. people have conflicting emotions all the time about all sorts of things. it's just that, if i had the opportunity to choose, knowing my child might have some sort of disability, between having the child and not at all, i would choose the latter. both for my own sake and for the child's.",6
"for not punishing my daughter the way my boyfriend would have liked?. today my boyfriend and 4yo daughter went to get a haircut together. my boyfriend has beautiful curls that i adore and he lets it grow pretty long. it never gets length it gets more and more curly. this time, he let it grow out way more than he normally has and became a bit self conscious about it, so he wanted to get it cut. my daughter has been wanting to get hers cut, so we decided it would be a good idea to get them done together.

bf went first and he decided to get it cut really short. we weren't able to see his forehead before and now we can, just to kind of give you a visual idea. when my daughter saw it she giggled and said ""you look silly!""

we were in the waiting area with two older men who were reading the newspaper when she said this and i told her it wasn't polite or nice to laugh at people for getting a haircut or looking different. i told her she wouldn't like it if she were laughed at and she said, ""oh yeah, oopsie,"" then turned to him and said, ""i'm sorry (bf's name) i just think you look silly with no curly curls. i'm sorry for laughing.""

i thought it was fine until he got up a few minutes later and said ""way too fucking rude, i'm going outside."" i asked him what? but he just went outside, and i looked over at the two men and one of them just shrugged and went back to his paper while the other looked like he didn't move at all. he then comes back and says ""outside. now."" where he told me he wanted me to cancel her haircut, take her home and punish her by taking her nintendo 2ds away for the rest of the day and making her go to sleep early. i told him no, because she already apologized and i didn't want to miss her haircut since we were already waiting forever. he ended up leaving us when i went back inside.

i wasn't able to find a ride home and he wouldn't answer my calls. we live about a 20 minute walk away (5 minute car ride) so we had to walk home through melting ice and snow while climbing snowbanks to avoid being on the highway due to the sidewalks being blocked by snow and ice. i'm 4 months pregnant and i have been having bad lower body/lady parts pressure that escalates into pain when i'm up and about too much, so the climbing really hurt. he knows this because he has taken me to my doctor about it. he had my apartment keys so we weren't able to get inside right away and when we did get inside the building, i found my apartment unlocked with all of his stuff (tv, console, clothes) gone and my keys hanging on the wall. our socks and shoes were soaked and i kind of hobbled to my bedroom and laid down with my heating pad. he eventually answered me and said it was my punishment for not punishing my daughter. am i the asshole?

tldr: daughter laughed at boyfriend's haircut and he got offended. wanted me to give her what i think of as an over-punishment and left us to walk home when i didn't agree.",3

"my gf likes me to go by different names.. to make this a bit easier to read, my name is jason.

my gf and i have been together for 1 year and for the past 6 months we've done a mini vacation at least once a month. we go to another city usually within a 5 hour drive for the weekend and rent the most expensive hotel room we can afford. this usually leads to the wildest sex because we don't know anyone there. in the past 4 months we've gone on 5 mini vacations and every time she wanted me to go by a different name. 

it's always been the same name, matt blank. i figured this was just a fantasy name and went along with it. she's done things with matt that she's never done with jason. matt took her anal virginity and deep throat ""virginity"". if i bring it up to her that jason want to try those things with her, she says she's not that type of girl. 

she's pretty vanilla when we are at home, which i won't complain about. i never needed to have anal sex or be deep throated but now that i know it's an option i feel like i'm missing out. 

here's the kicker, i had to pick her up from work a few days ago and walked into her office to look for her. this was the first time i had been to her office. i spoke to the secretary to ask where she was and started on my way there. as we were leaving, her coworkers came to introduce themselves to me. from down the hall i see this guy coming towards all of us and he says something along the lines of, ""hi i'm matt blank, svp of marketing"".

after we finished talking to everyone we went to the car i waited for her to say something but she never did. i don't know what to say to her or if there is anything to say. i feel really uncomfortable and i see our mini vacations in a completely different light now. is this something i should be worried about or is it normal?

tl;dr: i've been fucking my gf using her bosses bosses name.

"i installed a porn blocker on my grandpa's computer as a joke, and now he just bought a brand new one because the old one was ""not working"".. i did it as a practical joke, because i saw his search history, and i thought it would be funny to see his reaction. i was going to uninstall it after a few days, just because, well, i'm not a monster. then three days later he goes out and spends $250 on a new pc, because the old one ""wasn't working"". it was refurbished, and non-refundable. i feel bad, because i was one day away from uninstalling the porn blocker, and telling him i did it as a joke. and now i can't, because he spent all this money on a new computer. it's still kind of a funny story, but i feel guilty about it. 



edit: i maybe should have mentioned it, but everybody in the family knows he watches porn. it's kind of accepted knowledge. nobody really cares, and we all kind of laugh it off, and try not to think about it too much. maybe installing a porn blocker, even temporarily was a little mean-spirited, but the old guy could afford to go a few days without it. comparing it to punching him in the face is not really fair. 



edit ii: holy shit, there are more deleted comments in this thread than, well, i can't even think of an analogy. my grandpa and i are buddies, he's more of a friend that just happens to also be related to me. i'm not ""trying to control his sexuality"" and it's certainly not a freakin' legal issue. i couldn't care less about the fact that he watches porn, in fact, i'd be surprised if he didn't. i thought it would be funny to see how he reacts. that's all. it's unfortunate that his reaction was one i didn't expect (buying a new computer), and i feel badly about it. hence, the confession. if commenters on this subreddit's main goal is to make the op feel like shit, then nobody would ever post anything good on here.

"update: spectrum ""lost"" my returned router. i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8m57d0/spectrum_lost_my_returned_router/) last week about my experience attempting to return a router to spectrum, which was similar to experiences others had detailed in this other post(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8jdimu/always_get_receipts_and_keep_them_stored_properly/) from several months ago.

the tl;dr of the original post is that i returned my router to spectrum in their box with a pre-paid mailing label they sent me, and then they charged me for it anyway and wouldn't cooperate with me with respect to getting it tracked down even though i called multiple times. i eventually paid the charge because i didn't want it sent to collections.

however, on the same day i paid (and posted) i also filed complaints with the fcc and the ftc about their business practices. that seemed to light a fire under their ass, because several days later, i received a phone call from spectrum informing me that my issue had been forwarded to their research dept and that they were working on it. they proceeded to call me every day thereafter to give me updates, and this morning i got a call informing me that they had the tracking number of the label they sent, that their research showed that it had indeed been mailed when i said i had mailed it (shocking!), and that they would be refunding my payment for the router today. 

i just wanted to give an update about this so that others know that if you cannot get satisfaction from the low-level reps at the cable companies, filing a federal-level complaint may get some actual traction going on your problem. 

10/10 would take on big cable again anytime. 

**edited to add:** several people asked how spectrum knew i filed complaints against them. several days after i filed i got an email from the fcc notifying me that they had served the complaint against spectrum, and that the company had 30 days to respond. the next business day (and every day thereafter) i got a very polite call from a spectrum rep informing me that they were working on resolving my issue. the difference in how they treated me before and after filing that complaint was like night and day (they actually seemed to give a damn post-complaint).

also on edit: i received a letter from spectrum (charter) in the mail yesterday about this issue, dated the same day the fcc served the complaint on them. as part of the letter, they referenced the fcc case number, so it was definitely the fcc complaint that prompted them to take some real action on my behalf. 

here are links to file complaints with the fcc and the ftc:

"i know this is really small but for the first time in almost 2 months i went to the gym. i've been working so fucking much this entire summer and eventually i just stopped doing the things i enjoy. i fell back into that dark place i worked so hard to get out of. i stopped hanging out with friends, and i eventually stopped working out and doing stuff i enjoy.

after a recent kinda traumatic incident it gave me a reality check. i sat in my room for a week straight just crying and playing minecraft alone. i saw the true colors of what i used to call my friends. i saw how i was wasting my life and letting it happen.

hopefully all these improvements (i have a few other goals i'm trying to pursue also) work and i end up being a little more happy :)

"i accidentally proposed to my girlfriend waking up from appendix surgery. not really a fuck up, more just an unexpected suprise. so on friday i woke up at 7:30 a.m. with abdominal pain. my girlfriend of 7 years told me to stop moving around so much and went to work. i was rolling around for about 3 hours until i realized that my pain was getting more localized in my right lower quadrant area. since i work in the medical field i knew right away it was going to be an expensive day. so i grabbed my phone charger and went to the hospital. was immediately checked into the emergency room, got a ct scan and was told by the doctor that i needed my appendix out that day. so i was admitted into the hospital, my parents and girlfriend came. they were by my side as i went into the operating room. when i came out of surgery and was in pacu, both my girlfriend and my parents were there waiting for me. working in the medical field i knew that people my age (30 years old) say some crazy things from anesthesia but i didn't realize how crazy it was going to affect my life. when i started coming to, the drugs/anesthesia affected my judgment and i made a life-altering decision. i looked at my girlfriend, pointed to her instead, ""i want to marry you!"" right in front of both of my parents. she was in shock, so she turned to my parents and asked him if i was being serious or if it was just the drugs talking. they reassured her that i was serious because i had ""mentioned"" marriage to them in the past. so she said, ""of course i will"" and my parents said,"" welcome to the family"", then they all hugged. so yesterday i purchased her an engagement ring and the wedding planning has begun. so i guess the moral of the story is, sometimes it takes having less guts to have guts to do something?

tl;dr got appendix out, proposed on drugs, i'm engaged

edit: holy shit, front page? really? haha. a little background story, i was joking around in the comments. she waited until i was 100 percent first to make sure i really wanted to do it. i have discussed with my parents multiple times that i wanted to marry her also. my parents aren't grandbaby crazy, we don't want kids. i love my girlfriend and coming out of surgery made me realize how fragile and short life really is. no more fooling around. thanks for the gold and front page!",4
"update to negotiating a raise based on headhunter's invitation to apply. hi guys, i posted(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/disof5/negotiating_a_raise_based_on_a_headhunters/) a few weeks back about how a headhunter contacted me for a position offering a significant pay increase and whether i could use that to ask for a raise at my current job. it didn't get a ton of attention but i figured an update might help some people out so i'm posting one anyways.

the consensus in the last post was that no, i could not get a raise based solely on this invitation and i should either ignore it or get an offer before asking for a raise. i didn't want to ignore it, but getting an offer i had no interest in felt disingenuous. i decided to bring it up anyways, but didn't want to push it as a demand for a raise because of the responses i received. instead, i brought it up to my boss as more of a discussion about the company and why other companies are offering more. essentially the conversation went ""hey boss, a headhunter contacted me for a position and while i'm not at all looking to change jobs, they are quoting a salary more than 20k above what i make now. i feel like i'd be an idiot to not at least look into it. why are other companies offering so much more?"" 


apparently, there is a wage compression happening across my industry as a whole within the past year, and companies are having to offer more money to new hires to get them to accept. he also spoke more specifically about the company that sought me out. i have a very niche skill that is relatively expensive to invest in (scuba diving for underwater inspections). both of the employees who used to work for my company that now work for the prospective company were involved in this field. i do not do this with my current company and have little interest in pursuing it, but theoretically i could earn more money if i decided to pursue it with another company. finally, he ended with the fact that i am highly valued within the company, and he would talk to finance and see what he could do for me.


a week and a half after the discussion, we had a follow-up meeting in which he gave me a $4k raise, so ~7%. this is immediate, and i will still receive a raise in the spring for annual raises. not enormous, but enough to be worth the effort. he also said he is giving my coworkers small raises (although not as much as mine).


could i have gotten a bigger raise if i had followed up with the headhunter and secured an offer before bringing it up? probably. however, i didn't want to rock the boat, and it felt immoral to waste the other company's time interviewing for an offer i had no desire to accept. also, i'm lazy by nature.


tl;dr brought it up despite not having an offer in hand, got a 4k raise for myself and small raises for my coworkers. probably could have gotten more if i had an offer, but a small raise is better than the nothing i would have received had i just ignored the other company.",10

"wet the blade of your knife before cutting an onion. onions contain volatile sulphur compounds which are released when you cut/bruise the onion. when they come in contact with the moisture in your eyes, ~~they react and produce sulfenic acids~~ they can irritate your eyes and trigger your lacrimal glands to activate and start producing tears, and it's what makes you cry.

if you wet the blade of your knife before cutting the onion, those sulphur compounds will react with the water on the blade instead of getting in your eyes, so no more crying!

"my (22f) twin (22f) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23m) of 8 months.. this has happened with every single guy i've dated or been interested in. i've only had 3 relationships before my current one with ""john"". my twin sister ""sarah"" has tried to interfere with all of them. 

two of my ex's cheated on me with her. the third we broke up for other reasons but sarah still tried to seduce him. he was a good guy and always had boundaries with her, but that didn't stop her from trying. to the point of sending him nudes multiple times then claiming ""oops wrong person"" when he told her he wasn't interested.

when that didn't work she also tried to break us up by lying to my ex and our mutual friends that i was cheating. my ex didn't believe her but some friends did. so yeah that was fun to deal with...

then, when we were kids like in middle/high school, if sarah found out i had a crush she went after the guy herself. i used to tell her those things because well, isn't that what sisters do. she always used it against me. i told her i was working up the courage to ask my crush/ the guy i was ""talking to"" to prom. she then asked him and he said yes. she said he'd just been using me to get to her. another time a few years before that she announced to everyone in a class we shared that i liked this one boy who got bullied a lot. kids then started teasing him even more and he hated me. i felt horrible for months, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. she also once told a teacher who's class i was doing bad in that i was into him and willing to do ""favors"" for better grades. that got reported and i had to go through this whole counseling thing before it was finally cleared up. it was extremely embarrassing. my sister just blew it off as a prank.

there's so many other situations like this, she either gets guys who are interested in me to sleep with her or ruins my chances with them by making up bullshit to make me look bad. she's ruined some of my friendships lying about me too (told my best friend in high school i was gossiping meanly about her and went so far as faking text messages.) i don't know if she even actually wants these people for herself. you might think it's obviously jealousy but sometimes i honestly think she just gets a kick out of messing with me.

anyway i've finally got my life more together after wasting the first couple years of college on being depressed and a gaming addiction. i met my boyfriend ""john"" at a campus organization. i haven't told sarah, but he ended up meeting my parents by accident today. i don't have much contact with them but they decided to come for a surprise visit... they live over 5 hours away and do this a few times a semester even though i've said i don't like it. but that's for another post. john was in my room with me when they got here. i had no choice but to introduce them (he knows i was holding off on having them meet because i don't have the greatest relationship with them)

sarah lives at home with my parents while going to college locally. i'm certain they're going to mention meeting my boyfriend. and then cue her insisting on coming with them the next time they surprise-visit me. also stalking my social medias to try to figure out who he is.

i've tried to explain the issues i have with her to my parents. they think i'm over reacting, they say she just wants to know what's going on in my life. to be involved. yes that is the problem...her involvement. 

and, not to mention we used to be closer before i lost trust in her to stop doing this shit, so i've seen what her own life is like. she does things my parents have no idea of. she takes party drugs sometimes. this wouldn't be a big deal but she has no idea how to be responsible. she drives people around while drunk and high, my parents think she's with a friend studying on weekends but she's actually clubbing in the city and then crashes with her friends for the night. i'm not sure how many real boyfriends she's had but she's hooked up with a lot of guys the same night she met them. this has meant a few times she was scared of pregnancy. i've had to help her get plan b. it sometimes feels like she sleeps with nearly any man that smiles at her, and told me she's even had ""sex"" with a few girls while wasted however that's possible... she confides all these things to me, but whenever i need someone to talk to she has no time. never wants to hear anything unless she can save it as ammo. so i've gradually stopped telling her most things.

if my parents knew all this they might see where i'm coming from, it's not just random that i don't want her meeting my boyfriend. it's not because i want to hurt her or something. the problem is, our parents are really strict and traditional, and they'd probably kick her out if i told them any of that. they don't believe in sex before marriage. my boyfriend is the first person i've had sex with, and i'm afraid my sister could use that against me to them if she finds out.

so what do i do? how can i keep sarah from finding out about him and doing the same thing she's done with all my past boyfriends? how do i explain it to my parents?

tl;dr: my sister has a pattern of interfering with my relationships. she's gotten guys to cheat on me with her. my parents accidentally met him today and will probably tell her. how do i keep her away from him?",7
"by hanging out alone with 5 drunk girls. so, these 5 girls asked me to come and hang out with them in their pool. 
i thought it was gonna be a little party, but no. it was just me and 5 ladies in a pool. sounds like a every mans fantasy, right? 

wrong. 

i was invited over to start up a fire pit because ""i can't do it myself"". 
so, i ask ""having a pool party, huh? yea, i can do that!"" i get a reply ""yea, a party, sure!"" 

red flag one. so, i take my happy and hopeful ass over to this house where the ""party"" is at. 

red flag two, the fire pit is already a' blazin. 

i didn't think much of it, but i also noticed that only 5 girls in a swimming pool is kind of a small party, but i'm not complaining. i settle in, have a few drinks, hop in the pool and hang out with these ladies and all seems well.... then the night actually started to take off...

one of them got super wasted, stripped down naked and was running around the house hysterically crying, while we tried chasing her down so we could clothe her. funny thing was, she was the only girl i didn't see drink alcohol. 
and like a brick wall showing up while your doing 90+ in you car, bam she was blitzed. then, another girl looked at me at one point and said ""come here, i gotta tell you a secret"" so, i swim semi-drunkenly over to hear her little secret, but instead she kisses me. i'm thinking, ""okay not what i expected but i ain't mad."" 

as i go to kiss her back i hear, in an extremely angry tone, ""what the fuck?!"" one of the other girls (the one who invited me) saw it and was irate.
she swims over to us, and i'm thinking that i'm about to be castrated, but my presence doesn't phase her, she moves straight to her friend and grabs her by the shoulder and a fistful of hair, and drags her out of the pool and onto the grass. 
they start fighting, like literally throwing fists and tackling each other on the ground, ufc style. 

but, in the blink of an eye, they stop and starting hugging each other and crying like they just saw some cheesy romantic movie with a predictable ending. i'm thinking to myself ""what the fuck. should i be aroused or terrified?!"" 

i assure you, i was both.

after that, shit got scary. they threw me into the pool, and were trying to play some wrestling game, so they held me down. now, i grew up with sisters who were rowdy, so i know how to push a lady whose trying to kill off me, but 5! in the deep end of a pool while drunk. that shit got me praying to every god in every religion. i wasn't sure if they were trying to kill me, or got caught up in the moment, i was just trying to stay alive, man. their ""playful"" laughter is something that will haunt me until my dying days. i thought it was the last thing i'd ever hear. 

then things kinda settled down, so i, cautiously and reluctantly, stayed the night on the couch because i had too much to drink and i'm not trying to get a dui or wreck my motorcycle. 
but i woke up to this god awful sound, like a beast was chowing on its prey, and i thought ""aw fuck. this is it. these ladies are a coven of witches or demons and my soul is due for atonement. my lust, my greed, i deserve this."" so, i flip around to better see what's happening, and the previously naked hysterically crying girl was vomiting everywhere. i mean really going at it. like a fire hose. 

then, after painting the floor with a fucked up rendition of blue poles by jackson pollock, she looks at me and says ""sorry, didn't mean to wake you"" and walks away. like it was nothing. then, i just closed my eyes in bewilderment, and waited until i was sober. and i got the fuck out of there.

tldr; hanging with 5 girls in a pool sounds like a dream, but it's actually a nightmare and they will get naked and try to drown you.",4

"by drilling my 6 year old in the face, hail mary style.. ever throw something and know the very instant it left your hand that the throw was good..? sensational even?

&#x200b;

last week while being lazy, trying to nap like a good ""dad on duty"" should, i experienced just that. i heard a scream come from my 4 year old's room.. i slothily carried myself to the commotion to find him in a pool of tears, screaming that his older brother had thrown a toy through the window from outside and hit him in the face.

*""pretty good throw""* i thought to myself as i peeked out the window, my adrenal glands starting to kick some dust off.

""child's name"" i yell, my smug little 6 year old is jogging across our field, trying to act inconspicuous.

**""do not. throw toys. at your brother!""**

the following actions i took were inexplicable. i grabbed the small hard (hard) plastic butterfly, perhaps out of frustration, or dad-mode protection, and beamed it back out the window, in the general direction of my running 6 year old. surely without the intent of hitting him, perhaps just to show my frustration? a million year old instinct to assert my dominance? i could never make a shot like that. not in a thousand tries. he was at least 40 meters away, running perpendicular to me, his smug, older brother face looking in my direction, as if i didn't know what he had done. i would never be able to beam a moving smugface like that, too many variables.

*by god* as it rolled off the tip of my finger. i knew. it was *good*.

i knew before it left my hand, i knew mid-stroke, hell; i knew before breakfast yesterday. my son was getting drilled.

&#x200b;

before that toy left my fingers, i saw police, handcuffs, search warrants. i saw my courtroom, a stern judge and an unforgiving jury. no posted bail. no commissary. a life sentence. supervised visits in 20 years if i'm lucky. i saw my whole life pass me in an instant, i looked through the crowd for a friendly face, none to be found. not even my best friend, my wife, was there to support me. i felt that throw for a lifetime.

&#x200b;

fast forward a half a stroke and i knew. *jesus i* ***knew. it. is. good.***

&#x200b;

the smell of the turf, the cheering crowd, the stadium lights. last 10 seconds of the game, 3 points down on the 10 yard line. i spent all season playing catch on the sideline, waiting for the starter to get injured. now was my shot. a hail mary, 80 yard play is our only chance. i beam the ball with all my might and i knew. i feel the outer body euphoria when you just *know.* the ball sails to its target, the crowd knows now too, they go wild, game over! home team wins the championship!

&#x200b;

he knows as well. he knows better than i do. his life is over. in that split instant we had a conversation, he and i:

*why dad, why?*

***because. you don't. throw toys. at your brother.***

*but dad, i promise i'm sorry okay? please don't do it daddy...!*

***it's too late for that son. i already pulled the trigger. you're done and you know it.***

his bottom lip trembles as he realizes i'm right. no more second chances. game over. dad wins. he's taking that plastic butterfly to the forehead, dead center, and nothing can change it.

&#x200b;

3/4 throw and i'm in the vip room later that evening, feet kicked up, sipping top shelf champagne, surrounded by teammates, close friends and women on either side. my post game press conference is playing on the tv, along with the highlight reel. i laugh at how stupid i look in a suit. who cares. i am the mvp. i'll be damned if i spend another season on the sidelines. they shall rue the day they sidelined me. it crosses my mind that i may have made the best throw i*n history. i knew.*

a mile of airtime and wap. dead center, kill shot. chris kyle slaps me on the back. smugface wails and drops to the ground. dead.

""do not. throw toys. at your brother.""

the flag is draped over me as i make my exit, and return to my throne to nap.

&#x200b;

suddenly several security guards come in through the beaded doorway, along with two police officers. all official and serious looking.

the head of security approaches me, deep concern consumes his face. he hastily presents a cell phone to me, a hand over the receiver portion, to mask our words.

&#x200b;

""hey kid, remember that toy you threw?""

""***how could i forget... the whole world remembers!""***

""well.. your wife is on the phone, and she is not happy....""

&#x200b;

i take the phone, although fear filled the room, i walked not in fear, she would understand. she too would love the mvp.

&#x200b;

""*are you out of your friggin mind?! what did you do to zandipus?!""*

""***babe, babe, babe.. let me just say; i have an amazing story to tell you....""***

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

tl;dr - threw a dense plastic toy a ridiculous distance in the direction of my kid.. gave his face a schoolin.

edit 2 / update: due to popular demand, here's the rundown of the aftermath. it smoked him straight in the forehead, he dropped, he cried, and i felt terrible. i told my wife and she was really not too upset. it was the gray area between freak accident and awful parenting. i showed her this post and she laughed all the way through. she thought it was great. of all the positive and negative feedback this received, hers was absolutely the most important to me. 

anyways to the english majors and writers out there, i think you have to grasp that it's not a build up to climax, or even a carefully formulated story-line. more so a magnification of the euphoria felt when you make a decent throw. i wrote this in 30 minutes tops, without an agenda or writing staff. i had no clue it would grab so many experienced ears. i would go back and change it had i known it would blow up. can't really do that now, as a major edit feels unethical. thank you all for the kind words and positive feedback. i'll try harder next time. 

also, i am not a writer.

"charge a small ""adoption fee"" to prevent snake owners from using your free puppies or kittens as food.. i have a coworker who routinely looks at online advertisements for free puppies, kittens, or bunnies. she will pretend to be getting the animal for her children, but will really take it home and feed it to her reticulated python. she admitted that she won't pay over 10$ to feed the snake. charging a small adoption fee of $15 or $20 will deter her and other like minded individuals from dishonestly taking the animals for a food source. 

note: i understand that snakes are animals too, and need to eat. i'm not bashing on snakes or snake owners. i merely take issue with the dishonest means by which this is happening. in some examples that she shared with me, the previous owners are calling and texting to check in on the animals, so she lies to them. if these people care enough to check up on the animal, they most likely would not have given the animals away if the true intent were known. sketchy. 

edit: wow, this ended up being a really controversial topic. for the record, this is a true story. this woman is emotionally unstable, and quite frankly, doesn't have the mental agility to pull off a prank on this level as some have suggested. i do agree with many of you who have pointed out the possible warning signs of a sociopath, and i will definitely be reporting her. thank you to all those who pm'd me resources and contact information. 

also, i had never considered the concept of the bait dogs/fighting dogs and i found that to be enlightening as well.  as some have mentioned, the dog fighting rings may be the bigger more prominent threat. there were many comments that mentioned the fee really doesn't solve the problem, and that solid interviewing and vetting of new owners is a better strategy. i do not disagree. the argument of spaying/neutering pets was also made, and again, i do not disagree. the purpose of this post was not to spark ethical debate about the food chain, or which type of animals should be labeled ""food"" vs. ""pets"". nor was the purpose of this post to vilify snakes or their responsible owners. this story would have read the same, even if the animal she owned was a saltwater crocodile. 

my goal in sharing this post was to raise awareness that there are sketchy people out there who are dishonest in their dealings, and who may not have your pet's best interest at heart. so, whether charging a fee, or conducting more extensive interviews, or spaying/neutering, we can all be a little more responsible with the animals we value, to make sure that they do not needlessly suffer. hence the lpt.

"i got a tattoo of my wife on my chest while i was drunk.. my wife and i met when we were 19 and we were together until her death in 2009. it was obviously heartbreaking but we had a really amazing marriage and i try to remain grateful to have been able to spend as much time with her as i did. for a long time i couldn't bear the thought of being with someone else especially with our kids around. but after a while i found myself confronted by feelings of loneliness and despair. eventually i decided that i needed to move on, so for the past few years i've been 'dating'. overall it hasn't been great. most of the women i met weren't at all what i was looking for. 

but in november of last year i met a wonderful woman. she's looking to settle down; she's childless but she wants to have kids; she has no problem with my kids; she's a teacher; she's very intelligent; all in all, she is really great and we get along very well. we have been taking it kind of slow. we have lunch together most days and she's met my kids a couple of times but she has been pushing for more. i stayed over at her apartment last week had sex for the first time. she has a beautiful body and everything went well but the whole thing was quite difficult for me. i lost my virginity to my wife and this was the first person that i'd had sex with since she died so after it happened i was racked with feelings of guilt. i spent the whole next day drinking, trying to avoid having to think about it. then later that night i went and got a tattoo of my wife on my chest. i was very drunk and i barely even remember doing it.

it looks really terrible and you can barely recognize her face unless you've seen the exact picture that the guy used to do it. i'm a 43 year old father and lawyer, not some wannabe rapper. i've got an appointment with a tattoo removal clinic on friday and i'm hoping that they'll tell me what i need to do to have it removed. i haven't told anyone about it because i'm embarrassed.

"if i got paternity tests done behind my wife's back?. my wife and i are both chinese and have 3 kids together.

my kids have always looked mixed (white + asian) and it's only become more apparent as they've grown up. their skin is much fairer, they have freckles (no one in our families does), there is a brown tinge to their hair. two of my kids have brown eyes, but the youngest clearly has a mix of brown and green (i know mix isn't the right word, but it's not solid brown like 99% of asian). they also have white looking facial features... especially their eyes and nose.

honestly once you see it you can't unsee it and it's driving me crazy. i want to get a paternity test done behind my wife's back on the youngest (that looks the most mixed) just for piece of mind.

"i'm not grieving over this. our nephew \my ex-husband and i\ just passed away yesterday.  he was flying down the road at somewhere between 80-100 miles an hour last wednesday when he hit the curve 1/4 mile up from me and hit an 18 wheeler.  car went *under* the truck.  they airlifted him to nearest large city and after 5 days, it was a wrap.

what aggravates me is the outpouring of 'omg we miss you what a wonderful person you were'!

this nephew spent so much time bullying both of my kids, and a lot of other neighborhood kids, and nobody did anything about it or laughed it off.  he was into too many of the wrong things and his mom enabled him \even when he got her house burned down - the wrong people were looking for him there and they robbed the place and then set it on fire\ and he was amazingly disrespectful to people right to the end but somehow i'm expected to join the social media  sympathy train?  no, no and fuck no.  

i always said to myself that he was going to do something really stupid and then he'd finally catch on and see the light.  nobody told him to go flying down the road at too fast.  nobody deserves to die, but the luck on him making bad decisions ran out and i'm not sad about it.  and i don't see why i should be.  i am sad that a mother lost her son.  i am sad that my son's best friend lost his brother who - after all of that - *idolized* him.  but i'm not sad he's gone.  you play stupid games you win stupid prizes.  i'm mostly mad at myself because i like to think i don't hold that much animosity in my heart towards anyone, but there it is.

obviously consistently mispronouncing someone's name is rude, but i am speaking more about situations where there is no prior interaction between the parties.

for example, i am referring mostly to people getting mad when a new teacher or substitute mispronounces their name when calling attendance or people getting mad when they are at the doctors office waiting room and the nurse calls them in by name.

it's not that big of a deal and should not be an excuse to act cold to someone. if anything, it shows little tolerance to other people's mistakes or innocent ignorances. 

my name is in another language so as you can imagine people often mispronounce it... but you know what? it's not that big of a deal. so freaking what!? the world moves on and nobody cares that you're upset about someone didn't know how to pronounce your own set of letters that can be said several different ways just by looking at it.

"for rejecting a girl as revenge?. so, to start off, maybe, it was a bit petty of me tbh. anyway, i asked this girl clara out on a date about a year ago. i was a completely different person then, and she turned me down. it stung like hell, but it did encourage me to better myself. since then i've gotten in better shape, became more confident and generally i've had more luck with girls. i still never forgot what made me improve though, and that will always be a shitty memory.

anyway, me and a few friends i've made since last year went out to a gathering. i'm still fairly new in their circle, and surprise! clara was there. i think she recognized me but i wasn't sure. me and her hit it off, and at the end of the night we had a date planned. the date went pretty well and we went on our second one last friday.

after this i went home and thought about where to go next, and i realized i couldn't really forgive her. so, she hit me up asking if we were going out again, and i sort of make a joke of it, blew it off and put her on mute. i haven't responded since then, and our mutual friends say she's been pretty upset, since she gets attached to people quickly, but the revenge i got was so sweet!

"when i was 16 i prank called my dad over the course of 4 years.. i will save the details about what a unique and complicated human being he is, it would add to the story, but i am here for the confession.

when i was 16 i started hanging out this girl who just liked to smoke weed and chill in her room. one day, we accidentally called my dad and we heard him saying, ""hello, hello? heeeellloooo?"" it was so funny when we were high. this was early in the internet and cell phones so any trick was new and exciting. we started calling him periodically and saying nothing, it is still some of the hardest that i have ever laughed. we started recording his voice and playing it back to him weeks later. she would call while i was with him to avoid suspicion. 

 real innovation came when we figured out how to use three way calling to make his phone call other phones. he was one of the only black people  in our relatively small town so chinese restaurants and gun stores were always very fruitful . all of this peaked when we set up a call between us, him, and one of his band members that they kicked out for doing too much meth ( there was an acceptable amount of meth). by now, we basically had a sound board of him saying hello, asking questions, cursing and threatening. my dad had to simultaneously argue that it was his drummer who called him while explaining that it wasn't him who was cursing, even though it sounded just like him.

some other gems from our time:
- he said the fbi was looking for us
- he said he was running a trace on the line and we were making his day by not hanging up because he was going to be at our door step once the trace was successful.
- threatened us with his ""connections""
- more than once he had "" figured out exactly who it was""

a little backstory first because i left it out of the original post.

let's call my now ex-girlfriend beth, i am myself, my roommate is bruce.

bruce and i have lived together for going on 4 years. beth and i started talking about january 3 years ago. beth lived in another state (i used to live there and that's how we met), and we talked for a year before deciding it was time to move her up here. there is more opportunity and overall a better quality of life. she moved up here and everything seemed fine. she got a job and started making friends. 

well bruce and i's lease was up dec. 31st. beth and i started looking for places to finally call our own. we found pretty much the perfect place. 

this is where things start to falter a little. a few days around thanksgiving i've noticed her texting non-stop all day long. which isn't necessarily out of the ordinary since she has several group chats with her friends up here and back home. the part that really stood out to me was the she was laying next to me texting a number that wasn't saved in her phone, at 1:30 in the morning. i ask who she is talking to and she says her friends and mike. i'm curious as to who mike is because it's not one of the friends she normally mentions and she says she works with him.

fast forward a few days and i have to get up early to open my store. i go to swap the phone charger from my phone to hers and when i do, her backlight lights up and shows a message from this unsaved number saying ""hey beautiful, i just got home.."" this definitely peaks my curiosity.

i'm off the next day and she works early in the morning, so i stayed up and drank while she went to bed early. about 3am my drunken curiosity gets the better of me and i go grab her phone and head to the bathroom. she had basically been lying for a couple of weeks about them hanging out and cuddling and saying that she felt more chemistry with him than anyone else.

i was taken back and i was hurt. i waiting another couple days and did it again. this time beth was talking shit on my roommate bruce. she was making plans to go to ""zoo lights"" for a date with mike and his friends. she was telling him how she would have left earlier in the year but didn't want to screw me on the lease. she was just going to suffer through being with me for a few more months and basically set it up for this guy to ""wait"" while they discussed when they could hang out around my work schedule.

her and i were still planning on getting that place too. we had signed the lease, paid the deposit, and we were just waiting to take control of the property. the next morning after reading through her messages. i went down to the apartments we we're going to get and i asked them to cancel our contract. since we hadn't taken possession of the property they were able to cancel it and keep the holding fees we paid. in order to cancel it, they needed both parties to confirm the cancellation. so they had to call her and ask if that's what she really wanted to do. i ran into an issue here of ""how do i cancel this without letting her know that i know she is cheating?""

so i lied. i called and told her i found a place for 3/4 the price and was closer to my job and would save us a ton of money in the next few months. she said it sounded like a good idea and i convinced her to agree to cancel the new lease when they called her.

i had to wait because my boss throws a spectacular christmas party every year and he had already purchased everything for her to be my +1. this party was on a sunday and i almost ruined everything by being impatient. the saturday before the party she went out with friends (which i've never had a problem with) and then she decided to ghost me for the night. which she knew would piss me off and was well in her intentions. so instead of confronting her then, i went to mike's house (his address was in the messages they sent back and forth) and i put the ""love book"" i made her for christmas last year into his mailbox. i then drove to my job and slept on the floor of the office. bruce sent me a message at 4am saying she had just gotten home.

my plan here wasn't for him to find it until he checked the mail on monday, my plan didn't work out. my assumption is that a neighbor saw me put it in the mailbox and gave him a heads up. (because who checks the mail on sunday) but beth texted me that sunday morning after a little bit asking why i would go to mike's and give him her book. i know that she knows at this point and basically ask her what possible reason i could have for doing such a thing. her response was basically ""well what do you want to do about it?"" and i told her let's make it through the night, have fun at the party, and we would discuss everything the next day. 

we had fun at the party, went to a comedy show, followed by dinner at a nice restaurant. everything went fine, my coworkers knew but we're on their best behaviors about it. she could tell something was up, she messaged one of her friends saying that she thinks everyone knows and is judging her. they did know and they were judging her.

we go home and she goes to bed because she has to be up early for work and i set the rest of my plan in motion. i slept in the recliner and after she left for work that morning i drove down and picked up the uhaul i had set up for us to move into our new place and i loaded up all of my big stuff and took it to storage. she came home, realized what i had done, look her cat and left to a friend's house.

beth basically says she will be back in the next few days to get her stuff. so the weekend before christmas comes around and she is waiting until that sunday while i'm at work to get the rest of her stuff. i tell her to hang out at the house because we need to talk and figure it all out. so she is there sunday and is doing laundry waiting for me to get off work. 

i come in and i just start helping her fold laundry. i ask if her cat is enjoying her friends house. just small talk. after folding laundry we go to the living room where i set up my smaller than because i'm still in the house for a few days and want to play games. as i'm rummaging through wires, i tell her that i'm glad she has a place to go and will be taken care of. she says she is glad for the same thing for me. i scoffed and told her i was basically homeless because of this whole situation and she asks about the other apartment. i just tell her i lied, there was no apartment, it was the only way to get her to cancel the lease we were going to have. she sits in silence for a moment then goes to the bedroom and starts crying. i wait a few minutes and hear the dryer finish. her last load of laundry is done. i grab it and help her fold it and put it in some boxes. i help her out with her stuff. she comes in to make sure she has everything and as she leaves i tell her to drive safe and shut the door behind her.

now the second phase of my plan was the scrapbook that she had made me that was full of our pictures and concert memorabilia. i was going to wrap it and drop it off at mike's on christmas with the note that says ""if she cheats on me, she'll cheat on you."" but clarity hit me and before she could pull out and leave i ran out with the scrapbook i had hidden away and knocked on her car window. she rolled it down and i place the scrapbook in on her seat. she said that she made that for me, i can keep it. i just looked at her and said, ""i was going to give it to mike, but i've already been enough of an asshole. they are your memories, you keep them."" and i went back inside.

i spent the last week of december working and using what spare time i had to move the rest of my stuff to storage and clean the apartment before the lease was up.
i'm currently on a friend's couch, but have found an apartment in her complex that the landlord said i could have on the 15th.

beth and i are done. i love her but i can't trust her. i watched her lie to my face for about a month. she knew what she was doing and didn't feel guilty about it until she was caught. i'm just going to move on. take some time to make myself a better person. lose all of the weight i gained while her and i were together. get active again. find hope again.

thank you to all of the redditors who gave sound advice and an even bigger thanks to those who wanted to help me be petty. you guys really cheered me up with your gift suggestions and got me through a tough time with the laughs. ",7
"my grandmother literally paid me simply for visiting her. my grandma is in her 70s and does have a husband but he is away alot (he plays golf constantly and is also a mason and has family in england and america while we live in scotland). i'm usually the one he calls upon to check up on my grandma which i would usually do anyway when he's away since she is too frail to walk her black lab herself.
one such day was yesterday, my step grandad left early in the morning and wouldn't be back until 4 the next morning so i went up for a few hours to keep her company. on the way i bought her a cake from the bakers so we could have lunch together. she was so happy to see me and we walked the dog together since she wanted to go for a walk.
as i left she stuffed a 20 into my pocket just because i had visited her. i did not expect money and outright refused to take it, her excuse was that i bought her a cake. a small cake. from the bakers. it was a couple of pounds not 20.

it really puts into perspective how lonely elderly people can be and although she has the dog to keep her company she must crave human attention. i ended up going back later that night to walk the dog again for her and i won't forget the smile on her face as i unexpectedly walked through her door.

love you grandma

edit: i just wanted to say how happy i am about all the love! i also want to give my condolences to those who have lost their grandparents, i can't go through all the comments giving my condolences. thanks to those who commented with loving words, hopefully this post and you beautiful redditers made somebodies day :) ",11
"real life example how savings can be good for your mental well-being. hi fellow redditors, just wanted to share this little gem with you real quick.

i live in a country where we've just had 4 bank holidays. normally, the salary should be paid every end of the month, meaning march's salary should have been paid in march. 
apparently there was an error with our company's bank and the salary still hasn't been paid out yet.
almost all of my colleagues are freaking out how they're supposed to pay their bills now and how their balances are now negative and everyone is super angry.

meanwhile i'm sitting here with enough money saved from my last salaries that i'm super chill and would survive at least 3 more months without payment.

not having to worry on how to cover basic expanses can be really good for your mental health.

i should mention that i'm not talking about a minimum-wage job but we're all earning quite a nice salary and besaid colleagues really just like to spend too much.

so thank you personal finance for teaching me the importance of a rainy day fund, i'm now trying to grow it more until i have 1 year's expenses covered :)",10
"my newborn son passed away after 2 days in hospital. bill is $208,000.. my son was born in indiana but we quickly discovered he was having issues breathing on his own. he was air lifted 2 hours away to indianapolis where he spent 2 nights in nicu connected to ecmo. we discovered he never fully developed blood vessels to carry blood to/from his lungs and heart.

he passed away 3 months ago and we recently received the bills. my gf was on medicaid for pregnant women which covered $5,000 but the remaining balance is $208,000 + $50,000 for helicopter transport. the minimum payments are about $250/mo. we both work full-time but we'd never be able to pay it in our lifetime. 

our situation seems bleak so just asking if we have any other options?

thank you guys. much love to everyone.

my phone won't stop vibrating and this is making me emotional right now. i showed my gf all of your replies and we will sit down tonight to sift through this together.

you're all amazing and we appreciate you so much. i'll answer questions and post updates as i'm able to.

"i am a teacher who is having a baby over the summer. i want to use my sick leave and then take an unpaid leave of absence, but hr is trying to tell me i can't use my sick leave. please advise. (indiana). i have accrued 19 paid personal/sick days, and have an additional 15 in the sick bank. i am having my baby over summer, and intend to take the full year off. as it was explained to me, i need to take this as a ""leave of absence."" the assistant superintendent of hr said something along the lines of ""they need to hire a temp for a year, and if i take sick leave they have to fill it with a sub, and then getting a temp will be hard."" and something about not being able to pay for both a temp and me on leave at the same time...

i don't see why they can't hire the temp, use them as the sub for the first two months, and then change their status to temp and pay them accordingly. they are essentially telling me i can't claim over $4000 by using my sick/personal leave, which i obviously need since this is unpaid leave for a year. i feel like they are trying to just save money and avoid doing the paperwork.

any advice for a confused indiana teacher?

"i sold the only thing my dead mother left for me on her will and i don't regret it. my mother died 6 months ago. her will was short and she left us less money than i had expected. however, like most wills, she left us (the children) her belongings. she gave me, her son, the paintings that sat in our childhood home. she gave my sister most of the feminine things, perfume, jewelry, clothing etc.

when i first got the paintings in my possession, i didn't know what to do with them. i couldn't possibly hang them up in my modern home. they simply didn't match. and i'm not a man with much space for storage. if i haven't used something in 3 months, it's trash to me or it can be donated/sold. 
simply saying, these paintings were useless to me. i knew if i gave them to my sister, she would be ecstatic and put them all over her house. but i didn't want to give my sister everything. so, after four months of lugging around paintings, i came to the conclusion that it was time to let go.

i'll admit i loved my mother. but i didn't love her because she was a great mother, or a wonderful person. i didn't love her because she was always there for me. instead, i loved her for the simple reason that she was my mother. and that's just what children do, they love their parents. she was a narcissist and a damn good manipulator. she was a terrible woman. but even with this in mind, the sentiment of those paintings mattered to me for some strange reason. i felt as though i owed it to her to keep them. but i didn't.

i sold the paintings. i was given 10 and i sold all of them. the profit, i'll admit was hefty. and i am very appreciative for this reason. i doubt my mother would be happy with me. i know she isn't happy with me. but i don't give more than two fucks. i made $63,240 off of those paintings and i'm going to spend it well.

all i can say is thanks, mom. thanks for the paintings, but most importantly, thanks for the money.",12
"trying my luck on this sub. ""my 37m son 21m slept with my girlfriend 32, i don't know how to process this level of betrayal"". **deleted off the other relationship sub, advised to repost here**

i apologize in advance if this isn't the most coherent thing in the world, this is partially just me venting to the void. about 4 years ago i lost my wife, the mother of my son, to lung cancer. we had been together since we were 14. it was the darkest time in my life, i had considered suicide on a nearly daily basis. i pushed on for my son, and because my wife made me promise to make the most of life.

we had our son pretty young, i worked two jobs to keep us afloat and thankfully was able to provide a decent upbringing until he moved out at 16, although i still paid (and continued to do so until this happened) a portion of his bills. the loss was extremely hard on my son as well, he came back to stay with me for awhile and we'd work through the grief together every day. i got him into therapy, pushed him to get involved in things to keep his mind busy and when he moved back into his apartment i'd call every night to check on him and visited multiple times a week. we were always extremely close.

my wife told me outright after her diagnosis that she didn't want me alone, so i made myself available. my girlfriend and i met about two years ago and hit it off. she isn't my wife, but i loved her for who she was and we really connected. i was reluctant to introduce her to my son because i was afraid he'd feel i was betraying his mother so i held off for the first year, which i regretted as they ended up getting along very well. we'd hang out together, my son was happy, i was happy. she moved in with me about 5 months ago.

this past thursday he was over for dinner and movies. we've had this little game since he was a teenager where i'd pop up over his shoulder when he was on his phone in common areas and say ""stop looking at that!"" in an accusing way to mess with him even though he was never looking at anything. turns out this time he was doing something and i seen topless photos on his phone. i recognized the photos to be of my girlfriend, same tattoo placement between the breasts. i grabbed the phone from him and he immediately starts pleading his case. i go into gallery and there are easily two dozen photos of my girlfriend, some of him i'm assuming he sent to her, one or two of them together. by this time he's crying and trying to grab the phone back, i check his texts and he has two weeks worth of conversations with her (under a different name) detailing the fact they've been fucking around behind my back. my girlfriend is in the room begging to know what's going on.

i'm not proud of the fact i lost myself. i screamed at them both, i smashed the phone (yes, i know this is unacceptable, yes i'm in therapy, yes it's the first time i got aggressive with either of them), i demanded details. my son kept apologizing and saying he didn't know why and that it had only started two weeks ago, they slept together 3 times. my girlfriend was sobbing and kept trying to hug me, telling me it was ""a mistake"", purely physical and that she'd never speak to him again. i screamed at my son that i'd given my life to him, that he knew what this meant to me, that he was all i had left. i pulled him upstairs and gave him the money for his phone and kicked him out. i went upstairs to our bedroom, turned her drawers upside down and packed her clothes into two travel bags while she kept asking me to listen. i put them outside, guided her through the door and told her she could have someone else get the rest of her belongings this week.

both of them have been texting me nonstop until last night, at which point i blocked their number. i feel completely detached. the fact that after 2 years my girlfriend, knowing my history, could betray me is painful enough, and absolutely nothing will make me forgive her. she refuses to get her stuff until i talk to her so i'm having a friend drop it off to her. the fact my son, who i dropped everything for, worked non-stop to provide for, who was all i had left in this world could do this to me knowing what it would do is another pain entirely. it feels like i lost another family member. i ache for my wife all over again. i know everyone processes grief differently but this was two years after her passing, he had a girlfriend and i was there for him (as were therapists) every step of the way, so i have a hard time believing grief is the cause of his decision. i can't see this as a mistake, he didn't trip and fall. it was a conscious choice to betray someone who loved him.

i want to honor my wife by giving my son a chance, to hold on to the little family i have left. but this isn't like he stole money from me, it isn't even something that happened once while drunk. he was there for that grief with me, he knew how hard it was for me to move on. of all the women, he chose mine. all the apologies or future effort can'r erase that fact or the memory of it. i never did wrong by him, and now i feel like the kid i raised isn't there anymore. thanks to friends i'm not drifting into thoughts of self harm again, but i don't know if i have it in me to ever forgive him. if and when that day comes, what steps can i take to process what happened, talk to him without feeling disgust and open the door to trusting him again? and if that day never comes, does that make me a bad person?

**edit** some brief clarification since people on the other relationship sub took this and ran with it. 1.) nothing caused him to move out, he asked and said it'd be cool and i helped pay his bills. no hidden resentment i've ever been aware of. 2.) yes, popping up over his shoulder sometimes was something we both found funny. no i wasn't actually trying to invade his privacy, yes he was a part of the joke. 3.) yes i know i was aggressive. i paid for the phone and will be discussing it in therapy. 4.) yes i know this sounds like something out of a movie, it's not.

**tl;dr**: lost my wife four years ago, just me and my son ever since. found out he's sleeping with my girlfriend, feel completely empty inside. need some sort of comfort or advice on how or if this can ever be fixed between him and i, and if that doesn't happen will i ever feel whole on my own again.",7
"i miss my mom. i walked down to get my mail today and opened my mailbox to find a card from my older sister. i never get snail mail, especially from family members (with the exception of bdays). i started to open the envelope while walking back up to my apartment. when i opened it and i realized the letter was signed ""love always, mom"" i immediately dropped to the ground. my mom passed away 5 years ago. ive been having a really hard time transitioning into adult life (i'm 19 and living on my own for the first time, working to make money for school) and my sister decided to send me a letter that my mom had written her when she was my age and struggling with similar issues. the letter is so uplifting and so my mom. i'm just feeling a lot of emotions right now. i'm so thankful my sister sent me that and that i got to open something from my mom. i never thought i'd get something with her name on it again.

"if you're thinking about turning your hobby into a profession, be aware that it will no longer feel like a hobby in short order, and may not have anywhere close to the same enjoyment.. i'm sure this doesn't apply to every skilled hobbyist out there, but speaking for myself, and a lot of artists i've seen try to build successful businesses from their art, i can say that there is a good chance that you will hate what you do as much, if not more than whatever you're doing now for employment. especially if you have no experience in self-employment or know how to manage yourself with discipline and dedication.

i've been building gaming terrain for a living for close to a decade now, most of that time it's been my primary income source, and while i build everything with passion and perfection that i take pride in, it also *suuuuuuuuuuucks.* i often hate working on this stuff and only feel enjoyment when i'm done and don't have to look at it on the worktable any longer. before it was a profession i had great enjoyment for the process, but now i just can't help but count the minutes that i'm wasting, the cost-to-time-pay ratios, and so on. the business aspect of it has taken over my life completely and contributed to a real degradation in my mental health, culminating in a major breakdown last year.

if you're going to turn your hobby into a business:

* start it as a side job, don't get ahead of yourself. start slow and small.
* manage your time, learn to put only a certain amount of time into your work per day, per week. 
* never start getting in the habit of taking on more work than you can handle in those hours. be strict about this.
* avoid ""commission hell"" where you get backed up working on custom projects for people and at the same time have to do other work to keep the lights on.
* charge appropriately. don't sell too cheap because you're desperate to be seen. don't charge more than your quality is worth. see what comparable work is being sold for and judge yourself critically.
* cramming will destroy your soul. if you get in the habit of working past your scheduled hours into the wee hours of the morning to meet a deadline, you will burn out very quickly. if you're doing this, you don't have a good work ethic, you've made a mistake in your judgement of what you can accomplish.
* motivation is a lie, a passing mood, if you wait for motivation to get work done, it will never get done. you need *discipline.* if you have a hard time with this regularly, you need to learn how to push yourself *before* you go into business for yourself.

enjoy your hobbies as hobbies and only think of changing this dynamic if you are absolutely sure and driven to take it to another level. keep your working life and your resting/recreation time separate, or you may end up regretting it.

edit: let me restate what i said at the top, since some people are dismissing the whole post. *this is a common occurrence with artists and hobbyists who take their passion and turn it to work*, it's **not the rule**. if you are doing what you love, wonderful. this doesn't always work for everyone though, and it's better to be prepared for something other than what you imagine going in or you might get in over your head and hate something you once loved. i'm not discouraging anyone from pursuing their passions, just the opposite, preserve your passions and pursue them with the right goals and mindset. even the most fun activity is *work* when you have to do it 8 - 12 hours a day, so prepare yourself to *work.*",8

"if you drive a used car, put $100-200 in a savings account specifically earmarked for car repairs. i've seen some sound advice about driving used cars in the $2-3k price range. one reason i've heard that people lease or buy new cars under warranty is that they will never have to worry about repairs.

one other way to ""never have to worry about repairs"" is to save $100-200 per month and put it into a savings account earmarked for repairs. a savings account for repairs will take away all of the negative feelings associated with unexpected repairs. your account is also likely to accumulate money over time that can be used for your next car purchase (if your first car was $2000 your second in a few years may be $5000).

you can actually drive a bit nicer cars, too. i had a $7000 honda civic for about 5 years and after depreciation and repairs it cost me on average less than $40/month. it was a car i liked a lot and when something did break, i actually felt good about spending the money to make the repair because that was what the money was for.",10

"blind furry sexually harassing me at work. fl. i'm 18 and i work part time at a starbucks in florida (along with another serving job). i'm a girl and i just finished losing a considerable amount of weight, and i'm receiving attention for the first time in my life and i'm still not really used to dealing with it. i do know that the way i'm being treated now is very screwed up, but i'm not sure how to handle it.

there's a man who started coming in every day, who i've interacted every shift of mine for the last month. he is at least in his mid-twenties and comes in wearing a tail and making furry jokes very often. he is somehow visually impaired and he brings in his service animal to guide him, and he makes sexually charged and inappropriate jokes every time i've interacted with him, regardless of whether i'm make his drink/taking orders/giving drinks. if i'm not at the counter he yells inappropriately. the worst example i can think is him ordering a ""puppachino"" that we offer and letting his dog start to lick it and then holding it back to me. ""for the two favorite b****es in my life"" with a giant smile on his face before licking the top himself. it's usually not nearly that bad but it's pretty similar. he has pulled up inappropriate drawings on his phone and asked if i like doggy style. that specific puppachino incident was two days ago and his behavior continues to get worse. he does not seem to be severely mentally ill with anything and i think he's very aware of how uncomfortable he makes me. 

my manager generally isn't someone who is easy to get along with, and when i approached him with this he essentially handwaved away my complaints and told me that he couldn't do anything and that dealing with this was part of the job. he also explained that he knew about this specific guy because one of my other coworkers already spoke to him on my behalf without me asking (so i know it's not just me!) but he can't do much because the guy is disabled? i know that that's ridiculous, but i'm not sure where i go with it. it's not like i can really argue back. 

can anyone help me out with what to do? i currently live alone and i need this job but this one guy has turned what is otherwise a really fun and nice place to work into a place that makes me sick. thanks. ",2

i saw the initial disclaimer saying that this would give them the ability to send my info to the dealerships, but stupid me thought that meant i would select that option once i actually knew what i wanted...

and the big kicker is they have ""no way"" to cancel an account for their service. that is the answer customer service gives you... i would understand them saying that my number went out and they can't stop them from calling me but to not be able to cancel my account at all...

utter bullshit that will allow me to never use the service for anything again.

"by not asking for the perfect girl's number. reddit, and i dont think i will ever forget this.

quick preface: i am a 20 m in college at a state university. i usually dont post so if this post probably sucks but whatever, i needed to get this off my chest.

so this fu actually occurred today...
while at the local headshop (preparing for april 20) there was a really attractive red haired girl with quite possibly one of the most radiantly attractive smiles i have ever seen in my life standing in line waiting to be helped. as she was waiting, her phone went off and her ringer was r2d2. me, wanting to strike up conversation, told her that was an awesome ringtone, to which she replied that she is a huge star wars fan, which is awesome because i am too! we make small talk, definitely mentioning the new trailer that just was released and whatnot. we were hitting it off well, and we turned out to have so many things in common: we are both huge fans of lotr, super into gaming, specifically old nintendo console gaming and pc gaming, and obviously smoking (we were at a head shop so that is obvious). then, the absolute kicker of the whole situation was that she browses reddit! everything about this girl is 10/10 and when she walked out the door i thought my friend i was with was gonna kill me for not asking for her number. i've fucked up a lot in my life, theres no doubt about that; but i think this might be one of those fuck ups that haunt me forever.


tl;dr: saw pretty girl who is also fellow redditor, hit it off super well, didnt ask for phone number.

for those wondering, i'm from southern louisiana, i'm not gonna go any more specific than that location. i'm pretty sure that if she reads this, she would know who i am. even the guy working in the store was telling me how i fucked up not getting your number...
also, for those taking me so literally on calling her perfect, yes i know i only met her for 5 min, i didn't mean that's she's literally perfect, she just seems like a cool person and i'd like to get to know her better if the opportunity were to arise.
also, thanks for the gold strangers!

edit 2: so to clear some things up,
yes i go to lsu. no, i actually was not at the ra shop surprisingly enough; my buddy and i were at a 24 hour smoke shop just off campus, those of you familiar with lsu should know what im talking about.

edit 3: just logged back on after spending the day celebrating. there really isn't anything to update, no hits yet. celebrated a lot before writing this so... more updates later

edit 4: so, after celebrating for a full 24 hours... people have sent me pictures of random redheads apparently who go to lsu, so far no matches. that being said... i didnt make this post to find her, i made this post because i was at a solid 6 and just felt like putting it somewhere. also, to the people saying we were gonna date/fuck/etc., no, i just wanted her number to see where things would have gone had i not been a little bitch about it. and if she did/does have a boyfriend, who cares, she could have been a great friend, who knows.",4

"an extra organ removed without consent/notice. in 2009, while active\-duty in the marine corps, i had an appendectomy at the naval hospital on camp pendleton. the procedure was unremarkable and i went about my life as normal for awhile. recently, i started having strange pains in my abdomen. fearing the worst, i ended up getting a ct scan. one of the notes from the scan was ""surgical clips present from a cholecystectomy \(gallbladder removal\)"". 

not having a gallbladder is news to me. no one told me it was removed. i've had digestive issues since then consistent with gallbladder removal, but i wrote it off as years of mres and stress.

do i have any recourse? is the removal of an organ without my consent an injury for which i could potentially recover?",2
"boyfriend of 7 years likes his co-worker, and is persuing her outside of work. help.. boyfriend 32, whom i have known since we were both in fifth grade together, (i too am 32. our birthdays are a week apart), and have been dating for 7 years after many years of being such good friends, is pursuing his co-worker. 

he would always get so defensive of her if i were to ask why she blocked me on facebook, when i have never met her yet she works with my boyfriend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, and goes to the dog park together, unbeknownst to me. found that one out by finding a video clip of her on his phone at dog park. 

then i started working at same company, and happened to walk past her in the cafeteria area for employees, and she went out of her way to not even look at me. as well as my co-workers, ( boyfriend and i work in different departments even though it's the same company), saying it seems like he is embarrassed of me or something, the way he never wants to hug me, or say love you have a great rest of your day when we do accidentally run into eachother in the hallways. 

yesterday, march 12th he tells me all casual and nonchalant, "" oh i got my birthday off from work"", ( i should mention his birthday is march 17th, so he is now just letting me know, five days before his birthday, and about a week and a half too late for me to request off from work to be with him), so i reply very confused and offput, "" uhhhh, why are you just telling me this. i didnt realize you were going to take the entire day off, i would have too. he instantly quips back with, "" oh well you wouldn't have been able to anyways, you don't have enough time saved up. so i say back, "" what are you talking about, had you given me proper time as you know, you work there too, i could have just request the day off. by the way, that happens to be his co- workers day off.

then came the major break, he fell asleep on my bed after basically agreeing with me that he's not in this anymore, ( whilst scrolling through his phone barely looking up as if i'm bothering him to be so concerned of the subject), so i looked at his messenger between him and her. wow. he has been straight up saying to her, "" well if you need a viewing partner let me know"". another occasion he says, ""you should invite me over to watch with you. i have insights, lol"". another, she replies with, "" well my mom would probably have you watching cops with her"" he replies, "" i like cops. i'll watch that"". then another time saying he would keep her company whilst she's out of work for surgery, even if it is just watching cops together"". 

he went out of town on his vacation to ohio to see his nephew, and was messaging her pictures of him with the baby, and pictures of his sisters dog, and how they both just miss being at work :/ mind you i never once received or hardly heard from him while he was gone, let alone pictures :( i always asked him if they talked, and he would say, "" i'm making shit up in my head, and that they only ever talk about work stuff. 

needless to say, i woke him from his sleep, told him to please get his things and get going. he didn't even question me as to why i was asking him to leave. am i tripping???? help please.",7
"why won't people use oxford commas? cut my brain some goddamn slack.. the lack of oxford (or serial) commas is really getting to me.  it wasn't much of a problem before, as most texts kindly include that damn thing.  but as i tackle more and more text, i'm starting to notice how most of them are missing the comma, and it negatively affects reading.  as a random example, when i read something like ""...the shirt comes in a variety of colors, which includes purple, green, red and blue..."", my brain goes: ok well there's purple shirts, green shirts, and... red and blue shirts? oh, wait.  it's red shirts and blue shirts.  two separate selections, not a shirt of two colors.  

the lack of it is everywhere, from my art history textbook to my online driver's ed course.  please, for the love of god, use oxford commas even though it's not required in some formats!!

tldr: personally i think oxford/serial commas are helpful but no one uses them anymore and it pisses me off

"for telling my friend the real reason i don't like her kid is that he stinks?. i've asked my friends, and they are genuinely divided, so i thought to ask reddit. i (31f) am childfree, and i work with chloe (40?f). we've become good friends over the past year or so, and we hang out most weekends. we are both into knitting and wine, and we are both really chill.

ideal friendship, right? well, she has a 15 y/o son (braden), who is really unclean. he stinks like rotting meat and bo, and he also has this awful metallic odor that makes me gag. i know it's not a neglect issue, because chloe's younger daughter (11f) has never stunk. lately, i haven't even wanted to go over to chloe's, and i don't want to invite her to my house in case she brings her son. 

lady week was the last straw. we decided to go to the craft store together, and braden wanted to come. i drove them there, and my upholstery stank for a good three days after. the next day at work, chloe asked if i wanted to come over for dinner, and i had to tell her no. she really pushed me for a reason, and i told her her son smells like ass and i basically can't be around him until he works on his cleanliness. she sent me a text later (pasted here): ""hi yall-need-weed, the things you said about braden were really uncalled for and i don't want you to talk about my kids in a bad way. i am a good mom. don't talk to me until you apologize.""

aita? should i apologize?

edit for more info: yes, i did unfortunately phrase it that way. we both cuss a lot, but i definitely could've been gentler. 

no, i won't be calling the authorities on chloe. their house is clean, he has access to washer/ dryer/ shower, this kid just inexplicably reeks.

yes, braden comes with his mom to my house a lot. he doesn't really have friends or out of school activities, and he likes some of the gaming systems i have.

edit 2: no, i'm not one of those childfree people who hates kids. i'm mainly childfree because i like the freedom, and i've never really had a maternal instinct. 

also, ""lady week"" was a typo - i meant ""last week"". fat fingers ftw!",3

"my (18f) anti-vaxx mom (34f) refuses to give me my documents that i need to get vaccinated and encourages my family to harass me.. hello reddit, i don't quite know if this is the right place to post this but i appreciate any help i can get. (i'm sorry about my english.)

i recently turned 18 and until now, my mother still had all my documents like my birth certificate, my bank account stuff, and of course my vaccination certificate. i never had any problem with that because i knew she kept it safe and didn't misuse it to hurt me or something. at least until now. 

a bit of backstory; i was vaccinated as a baby, but sometime in between then and now, my mother got it into her head that vaccines are harmful. my mom's pretty naive, the kind of person that reads something on fb and assumes it must be true and doesn't actually look up sources or even google anything, ever. because of that, she thinks vaccines cause mental illness, don't help, are all just a big gimmick by the pharma industry, you get what i mean. obviously i learned about vaccines in biology and i informed myself about them so i know that's all bs.

when i was 14 and knew it was about time my vaccinations get refreshed, i asked my mom to go to the doctor with me to get them, but my mom refused to allow me. ""you can do what you want when you're 18,"" she said. thing is, i turned 18 recently, and the first thing i looked into was finally getting my vaccinations. i got infected with whooping cough last year,  it was the worst 7 weeks of my life and i had injuries along my ribs because of it that took an entire month to heal.

it could have been prevented if i had just been vaccinated and i want to take those precautions concerning my health now. so i made an appointment with my doctor for the 25th this month. i assumed it wouldn't be a problem, because i'm 18 now and there's nothing my mom can do to stop me. or so i thought.

she is vehemently refusing to hand over my vaccination certificate which my doctor said i should bring with me. we've had a lot of fights about it, and no matter what i say or how many facts about vaccines i tell her, she isn't listening to anything because i ""have no life experience"" and she ""knows a doctor from her anti-vaxx fb group who says vaccines cause autism"". 

she vague posted about me in her anti-vaxx fb group, talking about her ""poor child with no life experience who's blinded by the pharma industry"". she also talked about me with people in our family that have the same views as her. since then, random fb people i don't know and members of my own family have been constantly sending me messages and even calling me, trying to talk me out of getting vaccinated and telling me i'm stupid. i feel like i can't go to family gatherings anymore because i will be harassed and put on the spot and my mother would encourage it.

i just want to get vaccinated in peace! but she won't give me my vaccination certificate and the 25th is getting closer. so i wanted to ask; is what she is doing illegal? and in the likely case she won't give me my documents in the next few days, can i still get my vaccinations without it? i don't actually intend to press any charges against my mother, i would have nowhere to go and no money without her. but maybe i can pressure her into giving me the documents if ii tell her she's committing a crime.

edit3: i'm blown away by all the support you have shown me reddit. thank you so much guys! to everyone worried about my bank account, i have already made a new one. before turning 18 i had an account for minors that my mother had access to. she has never abused this or taken money from me. when i turned 18 i made a new one which only i have access to, so no worries :)

"by grunting while getting a blowjob. so i'll start by saying that this happened years ago while i was still a teenager in high school.

i was dating a lovely lass, we'll call her amanda, for just over two months. her family went on a yearly trip to a roller coaster theme park.  it was roughly three hours away.  they invited me along and offered to pay for everything.  honestly it was a great time.

 we left for our trip at around 2:30-3:00a.m. so we slept sitting in the back seat for most of the ride.  the park was a blast. short lines, decent weather.  there from open to close. afterwards we stayed the night in a holiday inn and left in the morning to return home. 

we were riding in amanda's dad's company car. it was a white 2005 cadillac sedan.  it was roomy but still not so much as to lay down unimpeded while sharing the back seat. amanda's parents were in the front. her dad was driving and she decided she was ready to nap. she put her head in my lap facing me and curled up in the rest of the bench style seat. 

she rested awhile but i guess she got bored and decided to play a road trip game to pass the time.  i wasn't aware we were going to play.  amanda started sneakily caressing my manhood with the hand under her ""snoozing"" head. i responded physiologically rather soon, as teenage boys will do, and quickly outgrew my pants.  

now, of course, i was nervous. i could see her parents and was occasionally engaging in small talk. through the rearview mirror they could check back and see my face but not much lower. amanda was wearing a hoodie with hood up and was laying mostly still.  all of this only added to the excitement though.  the risk was a reward to my adolescent mind and i sincerely doubted any repercussions.  

anyways, my pants had seemingly shrunk and amanda, having noticed my discomfort, took it upon herself to free me of their constraint.  now feeling the fresh air was a relief but risk increased exponentially and so did the thrill.  amanda must've felt exactly the same way.  so with thrill increased the obvious solution was to hide my exposed member in her mouth. i was not against this one bit. however i did have to bite my lip to stifle any verbal agreement to her action. 

we may have been young, and maybe because i was young, but amanda was a goddess from the lips in. every move she made was the exact right move.  there's something alpha and strange about seeing the back of someone's head while exploring the back of their daughter's head.  

so there i am.  trying to look natural in case they use the rearview mirror.  biting my lip, eyes wide open, mostly holding my breath.  looking natural.  there she is. looking asleep.  head slowly bobbing.  wet, soft, occasional, gagging noises.  normal sleep stuff. i'm starting to get close.  like three minutes in.  severe lasting power for my teenage self. 

we had developed little signals for this situation.  the orgasm situation.  not the blown near parents situation.  worked for both thankfully.  little double tap on her shoulder to alert her of incoming baby babies. lucky for me she was of the habit of consuming these salty potentials. which also was advantageous to this situation.  

here's the fuck up.  i'm starting to climax.  trying to summon lady gaga's best poker face. holding my breath and turning red. i imagine my eyes rolled up into my skull for a brief moment because everything went black. i uttered a single soft grunt. the pivotal fuck up was less than a syllable. i re-focused on the mirror to find her father quizzically looking at me.  in less than two seconds, i'm not even through my throes, i fucked this entirely enjoyable situation up. with less than a syllable. 

i saw realization come across his eyes. followed by anger. i hear a mutter of, ""wtf?"" i try to pull her head up just a bit. she slams back down in an attempt to contain catastrophe. however some little bit of catastrophe escaped.  a dime sized drop of milk gooey catastrophe landed just behind her hood. in plain sight of dad. 

risk or danger tend to make sexual events that much more exciting.  it makes them feel explosively more intense.  getting caught does not feel that way.  it's like coming to the brink of orgasm and then getting shot in the nutsack with a bb gun after the first gush. 

that little dime sized bit of full confirmation meant that i had to find my own way home.  no yelling. no berating. just, ""get out."" and i did just that. 

tl;dr

i got head in the back of a car that was being driven by the girl's parents and was caught just as i finished.

"my 27m girlfriend 25f spent the night with another couple. i know it's over, but i don't know how to deal with it.. last night my live-in girlfriend of 3 years spent the night with another couple. a couple that we are very close to. the other couple is married and are male and female.

&#x200b;

over the past year or so my girlfriend has been starting to experiment with women in the form of making out, dancing, etc. overall i was okay with this as it's somewhat of a fantasy of mine in a living-through-her-vicariously way. since i was a kid i have been stuggling here and there with a little body dysmorphia and often fantasize about being a woman with another woman. normally in my day to day, however, i am very comfortable in my own body. so, like i said, i wasn't against the experimenting in any way.

&#x200b;

after talking to her about it numerous times, it went from just having a good time to not being comfortable with taking things forward to maybe having another person in the bedroom would be a fresh take on things. typing this out it sounds like the classic she's-been-cheating-all-along, but i truly believe it's more of a discovery process.

&#x200b;

i told her i would definitely be willing to bring another girl into the bedroom and we agreed that the person would have to be right and someone we were both attracted to. around new years we were at our favorite bar for a party and i suggested we take a friend of ours home (not one from the couple). my girlfriend was hesitant, and i did not push, so that night we just went home and passed out together.

&#x200b;

fast forward to last night, my girlfriend made plans to go out to an event with a group of our friends, but i decided to stay home and try to take care of some backlog projects i've had going on. she had been messaging me all night, and finally around 1-2am she said she was coming home and would see me soon. it got to around 4am and i decided to log into her apple account to use find my iphone just to make sure she was somewhere safe. this is nothing uncommon, yet not a frequent occurrence. (inb4 comments about being overcontrolling and other accusations). i figured she had been drinking quite a bit and decided to stay at the couples' place.

&#x200b;

i've had a bit of insomnia lately due to stress from work and side work, so i finally climbed into bed around 5am. then i heard the garage door open and she came up to the bedroom. she said we should talk about something important. she then said that she slept with the wife. for the first 15 seconds i was happy for her, but quickly realized there was more on the horizon. she then explained that the husband was involved, but was more focused on the wife. though she did let it slip out there was penetration (not that it matters that much in my mind at this point).

&#x200b;

my girlfriend has endometriosis which makes vaginal sex extremely painful. after talking for a while, our recent struggles with my work stress coupled with her worsening condition made it obvious that our sex life hasn't been great. that's when she let it slip that while the wife was a good experience, she still hurt (which only happens with penetration).

&#x200b;

that's when it finally hit my that i had been cheated on. i explained to her that it's one thing if we're both on board for bringing another person into the bedroom, but to not even be consulted on potentially sleeping with another woman, let alone a couple, is beyond the limits. i love this woman, but between this and our diminishing sex life with a dash of pettiness that comes to mind, i realize this relationship is over. this is my first real relationship, and first sexual relationship. right now i am just afraid of having to start over. i've been taken advantage emotionally in romances before, and this has done nothing but drum these bad memories up.",7

"am i obligated to honor previous ""verbal agreements"" made from a business i inherited?. i'll try to keep this as black and white as possible...

i unexpectedly inherited a marina in ny 3 years ago after the sudden and out of the blue death of a family member.  over the past 3 years i've pretty much been trying to decipher the whole business and put together everything in a way that's more manageable for me to run.

the biggest issue i've had has been; it seems everyone ""had a deal"" with my family member for a discounted slip (boat parking space) and at first i was honoring those deals as to keep good relations with all the customers.  i found out that a few people have taken advantage of this and stretched the truth and even completely fabricate deals.  taking advantage of my goodwill and naivety.

with the new season about to begin,  after being burned a few times, i have decided to put my foot down and say any deals that were made under previous ownership will only be honored with a written agreement.  this has made one customer of mine livid and he's been constantly and inappropriately bothering me about how the deal he made has already been agreed upon.  *not by me but from my dead family member*.  

i don't have any written evidence but a long-time employee, who i trust very much, told me recently that the deal the customer made with my family member was only for one year.  he's now received the same deal (more than half off on a slip in exchange from some old equipment that i don't even use) for the 4 years (one when my family member was alive, 3 since i took over).  my family member took a ton of notes and seemingly wrote everything on his mind down, either on his phone or in notepads/random pieces of paper.  i haven't found anything about this deal.

trying to take my anger and emotion of being lied to and taken advantage of; i told him for me to continue honoring the deal i need something in writing between the two of them that gives details and dates of the ""deal"".  is this legal?  do i have to honor deals that i never verbally agreed to? are there any ramifications that i'm not thinking of by terminating verbal agreements that i had nothing to do with?  what about written ones?  can i tell him he's no longer welcome at the marina (contractually i have that right)? where should i go from here?  he's essentially dooped me for 5-6 thousand dollars.  i'm just trying to do the right thing, but i don't want to be taken advantage of or get in any legal trouble.",2

"found hidden camera in airbnb (seattle, wa). my bf and i are staying at an airbnb in seattle, we're basically living in the bottom unit (basement) and the hosts are directly above us. everything seemed fine. last night i went to use the charging cube and cable they had in the kitchen, for some reason it wasn't charging my phone so i took a closer look at it and saw that it was blinking. we shined a flashlight on the cube and realize it was one of those hidden camera charging cubes. it was in the kitchen but pointed straight at the bathroom, which means it has footage of us undressing (completely naked) and walking into the bathroom to shower. 



the hosts never informed us about this and we are really uncomfortable with the fact that it has footage of us without our consent. we contacted airbnb but they are not super helpful and now we are considering calling the police to file a report. is it legal for us to take the files from the cube (direct usb connection)? 


update 1: we called the police non emergency line, they won't give us an eta or when they are coming but we have to wait for them. we only have 2.5 hours left until we have to check out . . . so i guess we will sit tight until then

update 2: the couple left and went somewhere while we waited for the police. the police eventually did show up, made a report, took the camera as evidence, and tried to get a hold of the couple but couldn't. all my messages between myself and the host were wiped from the airbnb app, i did not screen shot them but have copies of what the host said in my email. we are going to mt rainier for the next two days so i will keep you guys posted after. 

update 3: airbnb messages are back and i have full access now, will screen shot and keep safe! thanks for all the advice and support, i'm just glad the police came and took care of it from there. will look into lawyers once i'm back. entering mt rainier now, will update later. 

update 4: the host has contacted me and apologized stating that they did not know it was a camera and that some other guest had left it behind, they seemed a little upset and offended we would accuse them of such things. i want to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that what he said was true. airbnb refunded me the entire stay without me even asking and have temporarily suspended the host. they are starting their investigation and will communicate with the police. the police are still trying to see if they can get data off the device and are still doing their investigation. so that's where i'm at, it'll probably be a while before anything happens so i will make a separate update post when everything is settled. thanks for the support everyone, it's been pretty terrifying and now i'm paranoid at every place i stay but i'm trying my best to just think of it as an isolated incident!

well, it's been half a year or so since the original posts and i wish i could tell you guys that everything worked out well. it has not. unfortunately, my ex-gf went full high school, psycho immature after the break up and my fears have been realized.

after we broke up, she texted a bunch of friends and family members, telling them i broke up with her because i have a small penis and that i am insecure. for those of you that read the original posts, you know that is not the issue. she would also leave me drunken, slurred messages telling me not to be ashamed of my size. these messages were clearly meant to mock me. i hit the bottle hard for a while after the breakup and was missing work and social functions. i've pulled myself together over the last 2 or 3 months and even started seeing a girl. unfortunately, this issue won't go away.

two weeks ago, i brought this new girl to a local bar i used to frequent. sure enough, i ran into my ex-gf and her new, muscle-bound, affliction wearing douche bro boyfriend. myself and the new girl were set up in the booth towards the back of the bar, and i had to walk past the table with my ex and her new bf. i didn't know how to react and decided ignoring her was best, as the relationship certainly did not end on good terms. it became apparent that they were already drunk and were now aware of my presence. i'll skip the complete rundown, but they started a verbal escalation that came very close to being physical. the bartender called the police who came, but as there were no fists thrown or damage, they basically just told all of us to go our separate ways.

i then got to have an awkward conversation with the new girl and explain all of the background info. she has been nothing but kind and understanding. here's where the new problem starts:

last week was finally time to seal the deal with her. we have been out on several dates. she told me she wanted to take things slow, didn't want to hook up right away, that she was looking for a bf, not a fling, etc. all of that is great as i really want to be in a relationship with a kind, loving person. when it came time for sex, i couldn't get it up. i cannot get my ex-gf's insults and actions out of my mind. last night, same ed problem. the new girl has been very cool about this, but it has completely destroyed me. again.

how do i go forward? should i just ghost everyone? move to a new city, get a new job, literally cut people out of my life? how can a past relationship ruin this one? i'm at a loss. i have no idea how to proceed.",7
"how do we know how to build large scale, but rare, civil engineering projects? (e.g. subways). melbourne (australia) is building its first subway since the 1980's.  building subways doesn't seem that common around the world in general.  when a project like this is undertaken, how do we find people who have expertise in building them?  furthermore, when the project ends, how is the expertise gained in building that project kept/maintained for the next one?  since these sort of projects are so rare, it seems hard for people to build up their experience to do each subsequent project better (as one would building multiple skyscrapers, or websites for example).

are these projects mostly done by people doing it for the first time?  are they informed by past successes and failures somehow?

edit: thanks everyone for the fantastic responses so far!  a lot of people are focusing on the 'subway' example, which was which first prompted my question, but apparently aren't as rare as i first thought.  so a side question would be, are there any projects where maintaining knowledge and experience in building it does become a problem, simply because the projects are so uncommon?  my other thought was dams, but they seem common too.",9
"(update x3) boyfriend of 3 years just admitted to cheating, we're on vacation together, i don't know what to do.. &#x200b;

i have no idea if anyone cares about the outcome of this situation but it is almost cathartic to write it all down so i'm doing it anyway. i finally have a calm moment to sit at my computer and compose a logical thought.

upon me returning home he and i had very little communication at my request. i had originally planned to spend the week at my friend's home to process this life altering event but early this afternoon he texted me telling me he was home. now, some people might think that shows a lot of effort on his part, that he's remorseful and rather than enjoy his vacation he flew home to talk. perhaps i would feel that way too except i asked for space. i told him that if he had ever loved me he would give me time alone. he couldn't even give me that.

i agreed to meet with him at our apartment to talk. i only wanted to talk about and sort out all the details. our finances, home, etc. we agreed on paying to break our lease, to stay on the insurance policy and phone plan together for now but unenroll auto pay so we're able to make our payments separately. i also asked for him to reimburse me for what i paid towards the vacation from hell. i wanted to wrap things up enough in that moment to where i would have to see and speak to him as little as possible. i know that some communication in the future will be inevitable but right now i can't deal with it. i told him he can stay in our apartment until we have to leave. i packed some more of my things and left.

i don't know if he looked upset or if he was crying. i honestly barely heard anything he had to say because i was so enraged at the person in front of me, a complete stranger. i don't know if the past 3 years were all a lie, i don't know if he has cheated before or that he would cheat on me again. all i am sure of is that he was capable of lying and cheating now. i refuse to be another cautionary tale of a woman who loved someone more than herself so she forgave a cheater only to be cheated on again.

there is a big difference between guilt and remorse.",7
what old insults need to make a comeback?. ,1
"calling self harm ""battle scars"" is shitty and stupid. ive never heard anyone ever call someone out on this, but calling your self harm your ""battle scars"" is an entirely retarded thing to say. its pure romanticization, and to me its the same as saying shit like ""suicidal people are just angels that want to go home"" fuck off and call it by what it is. its not battle scars, its just self harm and its as simple as that. to do anything otherwise is a complete disservice to people that self harm, theyre not fucking cute, theyre not to be romanticized, theyre ugly and shitty and arent a result of anything remotely close to beautiful. it might be purely because of connotation at this point, but i do feel like usually the people calling it that are the dramatic idiots that make mountains out of molehills and theres a reason why even though i cant properly verbalize it. 

edit: first off, im a girl, not that it matters. secondly, a lot of people seem to be getting the impression that id actually chew someone out for calling their own self harm battle scars. id never do that i only get annoyed by this enough to bitch and moan about it on the internet 

edit 2: i've pretty much changed my mind and this post is dumb and i should definitely be more compassionate lol. i already went into it in some comments and i don't feel like doing it again but don't expect a certain response from me since my opinion isn't the same

what weird things happen during sex that nobody warns you about?. ,1
"my husband's dirty secret turned out to be much dirtier than i could ever imagine.... obviously using a throwaway account because... yeah.

so over the past few months i've noticed my husband sneaking out of the house at night, sometimes for hours at a time. i'm one of those people that fall asleep as soon as their head hits the pillow, so he obviously thinks i'm asleep, but one night i heard the baby crying and noticed he wasn't there. at first i thought he was sneaking out to see another woman, but it turns out it was worse than that, in my opinion anyway.

we had our first child in february this year, and he's been a really hands-on father. always is there to take care of the baby despite having a full time job when i need a break and all that.

i don't know how else to really say what he's doing without it sounding completely insane (because it kind of is) but it turns out, when my husband goes out at night, all he does is go into the yard where the trash cans are, rummages around, and fishes out a dirty diaper from our child, opens it, and just stands there smelling it. it seems to only be the ones that our son has gone number 2 in, because i've seen him toss back ones that presumably only have been peed in and look for a dirtier one. and then he just *stands* there, taking this deep contented breaths in of our child's excrement. for ages.  the sad thing is, he looks so damn happy when he's doing it too. i've watched him from the window for weeks now, just standing out there, sniffing with this huge grin on his face, and then rummaging around for another.

the real icing on the cake was the other night when he came back to bed, once again thinking i was asleep. he must have got a bit too close to the diaper when he was sniffing our son's business, because when he got into bed with me i could smell something and opened my eyes a bit when i finally heard him snoring and it turns out he had a bit of poop on his nose.  i felt so disgusted.

so i'm at a loss as to what i should do now. i love my husband but this freaks the hell out of me. has this happened to anyone else before? is it a fetish or something? i'm too scared to confront him but i know it needs to be done, and any advice would be great because, i mean, shit.

**tl;dr - my husband sneaks outside at night to rummage around in the trash for our son's soiled diapers and then sits out there smelling them for hours. don't know what the %*#& to do. help?**

-----

edit 1: i'm still awake right now feeding the baby and waiting to see if he'll make a move later on. thinking about confronting him, but not sure if i will or not yet. will update.

-----

edit 2: wow, i can't believe how many people have replied to this post - first of all thank you for all the people who wrote in with such thoughtful advice, i can't reply to everyone but i've read every comment on here so thank you.

i still haven't confronted my husband about what he's doing, and the other night after my update, after waiting an hour or two, sure enough he snuck out again for his nightly diaper sniff. i was planning on confronting him but he ended up coming inside after only smelling one or two, and by the time he came back into bed i was too nervous and flustered to say anything, so just pretended to be asleep. i've decided though that either tonight or whenever he goes outside next (he doesn't every night, but most nights) to take a photo of him in the act and be waiting for him with the evidence when he returns inside. i've never been good with words and i'm just too nervous to sit down with him and bring it up, and someone suggested i photograph/video him so he has no choice to explain since i obviously have evidence and leave him no room to pass it off as me maybe seeing him doing something else. hopefully i can get a clear enough picture that it will be enough for him to realise there's no way out but confront the issue. i'm nervous about how he will react, but i know he loves me and our family and hopefully there is some way we can work through whatever this is together as a family. 

thanks again for all the supportive comments and advice. there has been overwhelming support and only a few weird comments, and i really appreciate people reserving judgement of my family and i.  i will update again once i've confronted him, and hopefully i'll be able to wrap this up nicely and it will be happy endings all round :)

"by accidentally shared nude photos of my gf and me to her very religious parents. throwaway, blablabla here goes. this is only about 2 hours ago, situation still developing. any advice is welcome.

context: so i've been dating this amazing woman for almost 4 years. went to the same uni, graduated together, lost virginities together, and we've been having an amazing relationship both in physical and emotional sense. i came from a secular family and she comes from a very religious family, though she's having doubts about religions as of late. my parents have been very good to my gf, but her parents don't like me very much because of racial and political reasons and because they know i'm not really a religious person. but still, my gf stuck with me ever since even though her parents doesn't ever stop badmouthing me (if you want to know my gf's parents' behavior, try reading up r/raisedbynarcissists and r/justnomil).

i've collected a fair amount of porn photo collection, particularly the artsy ones (metart, x-art etc) and have been wanting to photograph my gf in a similar sense. due to her having discovered her sexual sides, she agrees and actually enjoys having to pose according to my whims.

it's been about 2 years since we've been doing this and so far nothing slips by - we're very careful about the risks of our photos leaking out. that is until today.

my gf have been using this beater old phone, and she recently switched to a newer mid-range phone. she gave her old phone to her little sister who's still living with her parents. 

so we booked an amazing airbnb on our days off, and started taking photos with my gf's new phone. then i started editing the pictures in google photos, not realizing what i've been doing. then we relaxed, cooked some french fries and watched godfather 2. then my gf got a call from my parents, sounding furious, and my gf started crying. her parents demanded why does she have very explicit pictures with me, whom they disapprove since day one. her parents told my gf that gf's little sister got our nude photos, and forwarded it to them.

in a panic, we begin searching our social media posts, fearing that we shared our photos by mistake. instagram? nope, our friends didn't see anything in our posts or instastory. whatsapp/facebook? nope, we didn't post anything, nothing at all. then a bulb turned off in my head, and i looked to gf's google photo settings and gf's google account setting in the web. to my absolute horror, her old phone, which have been given to her little sister, still have access to every data that my gf have, including passwords, 2-factor authentication, emails, and worst, google photo back up and sync photos. 

what gf didn't realize is she forgot to log off her google account in her old phone. in order for her photos to be always backed-up, she turned on the synchronization in her google photos app in both phones. if you're familiar with google photos, or if you work in it, you know where this is going.

you see, every time i take a picture with the new phone, those pictures shows up in the old phone now belonging to gf's little sister. so now, her parents are furious with her and me, suspecting that i've just been using her for sexual purposes and trying to get her pregnant, and now they're coming to my gf's place (which is 4 hours apart from their home) demanding explanations. now, i love this girl to death, so i've been preparing mentally to talk with her parents about all this. i guess the only silver lining is that our photos didn't leak out to our friends/colleagues/public. wish me luck guys.

tldr: google photos sync accidentally shared my gf's explicit photo in her phone with her little sister's phone, who told her parents. now her parents is coming to town and i've been preparing to face the nuclear fallout.

"update - my (38f) brother (36m) stole $50,000 from me. should i take him to court or walk away and never talk to him again?. update from original thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9d1yfs/my_38f_brother_36m_stole_50000_from_me_should_i/

your feedback gave me the courage to take action. thank you!  you all helped me realized that just because my brother is family doesn't mean i should let him take advantage of me.

i decided to sell the house and gave my brother the option of buying me out.  he strung me a long for a few weeks, then decided he didn't want to do it.

i sold the house to an investor. i offered my brother money to move out and a large chunk of money from the sale of the house (almost as much as he originally invested) if he was cooperative.  i haven't heard back from him about the offer.

he hasn't replied to my phone calls, texts or email.  so, i'm guessing he's pissed.  but, i believe i did the right thing, even though it was really difficult. i put myself first for once. thank you for your advice!!!",7
"we should have an adult version of the book fairs from when we were kids. so basically like the scholastic book fair that would come around every year to your school, but for adults. it would have all that years new releases and best sellers, comic books and graphic novels, and a bunch of other stuff (like pop figures, collectibles, shirts, etc.) thanks for coming to my ted talk.",6
"i got a handjob from a masseuse. i've got a fiance and if i tell her, i'm sure she would break up with me.. pretty much the title.  this happened 5 hours ago, i went for a massage at a (admittedly above-board) looking place.  the masseuse told me to get naked and she would be back in five minutes.  while she was massaging my upper thigh, i got a boner.  she noticed this, removed the towel and went to business like it was just part of the procedure.  i didn't stop her.

upon checking the massage parlors website when i got home, they clearly indicate that ""sensual massages"" are available upon request.  i guess seeing as i am a slightly overweight and balding 34 year old man, she assumed i was there for that.

my fiance gets home from work in a few hours.  i really need to tell her.  i wish i could go back 8 hours and not get into my car to drive to this place. so much fucking regret.

**update:**

i told her.

i feel like shit about it, and if it happened to her, i would want to know.  we are going to be spending the rest of our lives together and i don't want shit like this in my closet, and if this happens to her, i want her to be able to tell me.  anyways, the conversation was quite short and went something like this:

claire's first question was ""was she pretty?""  i answered truthfully, which she was an average middle-aged women who smelled like cigarettes and stale coffee.

the follow up was ""well then why didn't you stop her?""  because i honestly froze for a minute, and just went with it.

she didn't really like this answer.  she then asked ""are you not happy with me?""  i told her that she is absolutely perfect, but this had nothing to do with being happy in the relationship.  i was in a position where i had to do something and i didn't, which is my fuck up and failure as a partner.

she then said that she is not going to break up with me ""just yet"" but will sleep on it and see in the morning.  she seemed pretty hurt, she was fighting back tears.  i offered to sleep in the guest bedroom and she said that i didn't have to be that dramatic.  maybe a good sign?

a few people have bought up sexual assault.  i don't feel like a victim, i feel like a perpetrator.

(**probably) final update:**

i think we are good, all things considered.  i'm probably not going to update this post again unless something drastically changes.

we had a brief chat this morning before she went to work (i work from home) and she told me we need to talk tonight.

i said ""uh-oh, that doesn't sound great"" and she ""it's not like that, i just needs to understand why you didn't stop her"". i asked her what would happen if we reversed roles, and she said she would stop the dude. i said i would say the same thing, but in practice i just froze up and couldn't. she was surprisingly empathetic towards this.

she also said she doesn't feel like she can trust me right now (understandable), but she doesn't feel like i cheated on her per se, rather i just did something incredibly stupid.

she actually said she almost wishes that i didn't tell her, we agreed that our marriage needs to be a 100% open and honest relationship, we are a team and need to deal with shit together. we've both had relationships in the past where this was not the case, and landed up getting hurt as a result.

all that was about 6 hours ago, at about 9:00am this morning.

she texted me about an hour ago saying she still loves me, and the more she thinks about it the more she sees it as a mistake, not a character flaw, and that if i find myself in a position where this can happen again, i need to stop it.

i wrote an email (with an old anonymous email address i have) to the place describing what happened. i didn't mention the masseuse's name - but what happened and that the ladies there should be asking for consent. i got an almost immediate reply apologizing and assuring me that they are not a brothel etc. more like cya stuff than acknowledging the problem. but at least i did something.

\---

thanks everyone for taking the time to read my story and comment.  honestly, i got a lot more support and attention than i thought that i would, and it helped a lot.  even those calling me out for being a bitch, i probably needed to hear that as well.  a simple ""no"" would have turned this whole thing into a  mildly humorous anecdote.

"women who walk around in thin yoga pants and tiny tops or other revealing clothing with perfect bodies should stop acting surprised and offended guys are sometimes taking a look.. if i am a heterosexual male, i see a perfectly shaped round ass in the tightest of yoga pants, i am going to at least take a quick look. no, i dont think you are just a mere sex object. i just think you look good and if you are walking around like that even when you are not exercising, i think you may even want people to look. why else are you dressed in super slim tight fitting material accentuating your ass doing things unrelated to exercise, unless you want to show it off? the same applies to women with nice breasts that decide to always have the most ridiculous cleavage wondering why guys sometimes look.

i say this because so many times i see women complain that guys stare saying  ""women are not mere sex objects, stop looking at her ass or cleavage you creep"". then i see the same women walk around in extremely tight fitting yoga pants and pouting their perfect asses about like they want people to look. i mean, if i was ripped with a 12-pack like arnold in his 20s and walked around without a shirt all day i bet some girls would stare. i wouldn't complain i am being ""treated as a sex object"" because i would expect people to look. if you look good and you wear tight clothing that work to reveal your very beautiful body parts, being offended that people sometimes look is stupid.",6

"by having one leg.. so, i've been missing my leg for four years now. i've adapted quite well. i get around just fine with a prosthetic.

however, when i'm at home in my small apartment, i prefer to crawl short distances instead of going through the hassle of putting my prosthetic on. it's jut more convenient that way.

so last night we had some company over to watch scary movies, and i read everyone a few short submissions to /r/nosleep. everyone was pretty spooked before we went to bed. two friends of mine slept on the couch, and one of them was someone we have never had over before. so this individual had never seen me crawl without my leg on. to describe it, i kind of move like a very slow cheetah who's missing a hind leg. like a tri-pod crawl, if that makes sense. so, i suppose it can be unsettling if you're not expecting it. 

in the middle of the night/early morning, i decide to leave my room for a drink. i didn't turn the hall light on so i wouldn't disturb my sleeping guests. there's just enough light coming from the light above the sink to guide me where i needed to go. as i'm turning the corner to enter the kitchen, i see a figure and i hear ""oh shit what the fuck"", next thing i know, i'm getting kicked in the face. 
i suppose my friend recognized my foul mouth screaming back at him, because then he turned the light on and started apologizing profusely. 

tl;dr: i crawled through my apartment without my prosthetic leg, my friend thought i was a demon and started kicking me in the face.  


edit: a lot of people are asking why i don't just hop. well, in the accident that took my leg, i also maintained compound fractures in all the long bones in my remaining leg, causing the my femur, tibia, and fibula too all be replaced by titanium rods. hopping on such a leg causes too much stress and pain to my remaining knee cap. 
even without those injuries though, it's usually not recommended for any amputee to hop as a frequent mode of transport, even for short distances. ",4
"stranger zelled me $1,000 usd before i even had the chance to call the bank to ask for it to be returned, they filed a chargeback and got my account frozen.. hello reddit! local college student here.

i'm in a bit of a bind. a complete stranger has zelled me a huge amount of money. seeing this as strange, i called up chase on the phone, to report the transaction. the girl over the phone was fumbling, acting strange, but eventually told me to go to the bank with two forms of id. i went to my local branch, explained the situation, where me, a man working there helping me, and a woman on the phone all conversed. the man was extremely understanding, but while we were speaking, the person sent me another twenty dollars. i immediately showed them. i asked if all of this could be reversed as i don't want to hold a strangers money, but by the time i was able to do anything, they filed a dispute saying the transaction was unauthorized. chase has now frozen or temporarily restricted my account because of this, even though i had no idea what i had done wrong. the woman over the phone was talking over me, as i was trying to dig for an answer as to why this happened. funnily enough the person only reported $500 being unauthorized, but i filed a dispute asking to give the other $520 be returned to the sender. i'm quite young, only 19 years of age, and i do receive financial aid for college, which comes in the form of a check. i feel sick to my stomach, and like i can't explain it to anyone, my parents aren't the most understanding folk, so my questions today are:

is there any way for me to cash my check while my account is frozen pending this investigation?

can i open up a temporary account to use while this investigation goes on with chase?

what would be the best course of action to get my account back to its regular status as fast as possible, so that i may use my debit card again?

thank you so much to anyone and everyone who reads this.

edit: called today and they said they can't do anything until the funds are removed. and that my account is frozen to protect me because the scammers might be going after my account next, (which makes sense.) thank you everyone who's been informing me on the issue, i'll go heading to open up a new bank account soon, but firstly today i'll be speaking to a branch manager about what i can do.",10

"i laughed at my date yesterday (my bad).. i met a girl on tinder on sunday night. my general strategy is to essentially say hello and then go on a date as soon as possible. we went on a coffee date yesterday afternoon. she's in college so we talked about her major and stuff and then i asked her if she worked. she told me that she is a prostitute. i started laughing because i thought she was joking but it was clear that she didn't find it funny. i asked if she was on the job at that moment and she assured me that she wasn't but the whole situation was so odd and i was pissing myself laughing. she was visibly upset at the way i was acting but i couldn't help myself. i got really nervous and cracked a few jokes about it. but it was getting uncomfortable so i just sculled my coffee, wished her a good evening and then got out of there. i spent half of last night pissing myself laughing at the whole situation.

i know it was a little mean but fucking hell. just casually telling a guy you're a prostitute while you're on a date? like i'm going to date you while you're being paid to fuck other guys? i just found the whole thing so hilarious. my apologies to the girl, but i couldn't help myself.

"by ordering a nsfw item through amazon and not turning off shipping notifications. i have been planning to surprise visit my girlfriend for a while recently and decided that i should buy some ""items"" off of amazon to spice things up in the bedroom.

now this normally wouldn't be a problem, except i have an amazon echo located in my parents house, along with one in my own house, but because my parents don't have their own amazon account, both echos are under my account...

~~so when one gets a notification, so does the other one...~~

so my father texted me that, ""alexa is glowing"" and trailed off. i didn't think much of it until when i got home and my echo was blinking yellow. i asked alexa for the notification, and she gave a very descriptive narration of the ""sexy"" item that had been delivered today...

and it dawned on me, that alexa ~~gave~~ _almost gave_ that same notification to my parents...

&#x200b;

needless to say, i have now disabled shipping notifications and will look into getting them their own amazon account.

&#x200b;

tl;dr

i ordered an intimate bedroom item through amazon and my parent got to hear the lovely description of the item courtesy of alexa, embarrassing me indefinitely.

&#x200b;

edit: thanks for the gold and silver strangers! i didn't expect this to get as much attention like it did.

i answered what the items were in a comment down below but here it is:

""word for word, syllable for syllable as slow and enunciated as could be ""deksias crotchless bodystocking open cup crotchless bodysuit sexy lingerie nightie"" and ""svakom powerful vibrating cock ring vibrator - waterproof rechargeable penis ring - svakom tyler full silicone clitorial vibrators vibes stimulators for female - sex toy for male or couples, black"" - as she just said the entirety of the title of the product on amazon smh. and there you have my search history, don't go too wild with it ;)""

thanks to everyone that let me know that because i heard it, the other one didn't. i'm fairly unfamiliar with how the devices work as a unit so i'm glad that they probably didn't hear what the item was. that's gonna save me a lot of embarrassment! i crossed out the assumption i made about their device hearing it, but i was on edge for the rest of the night worried that they heard it.

let this be a warning to everyone to make sure they turn off their notifications in case they don't want anyone to hear them 😂",4

"should i try to pay for a house in cash, or is this a really bad use of money?. my 24m wife 23f and i are just getting started with our careers, and we almost have all of our debt paid off. our credit scores are great, and we could live off of my salary alone fine, but she will probably be making more than me starting in two years once she finishes law school and gets a job. we are both pretty risk averse, and i've always been leery of the way americans buy a $400k house for a 30-year mortgage (pronounced ""debt"") and then end up paying much more for that house over that time period. 

so, we have been talking about staying in our apartment for a couple years longer than originally planned and trying to buy a house... in cash. even if not the whole thing, maybe putting like 60% down or more, and trying to have it paid off within four or five years. to me, it's about cash flow and getting things paid off as quickly as possible so that if something were to happen to one of us (disability or illness, lose our job, etc), we wouldn't be screwed and living in a bigger house than we can afford. i'm big on not having debt - it terrifies me.

i told my friends about it and they thought it was a very dumb idea. they said i should put 20% down or so - however much is needed to get the lowest interest rates possible - and then invest the rest. they said i would get better returns through investing, and it hedges against the risk of your house burns down or property values plummet. i get that, but a) isn't that what insurance is for, and b) the beauty of owning a house outright is that if the property values plummet and the economy tanks... we wouldn't really care because we own that house. to me it still makes sense to try to buy a house in cash even if it isn't the best ""investment"" decision.

"my 31f boyfriend 34m broke up with me sort of because i asked if i was invited to his sister's wedding. so, this might be a long read. i am not using a throwaway because i don't care.

my boyfriend and i have had an interesting relationship. i would say the main thing that has divided us has been that his family is kinda racist southerners and i am a mixed race person. he assured me that this wouldn't be an issue when i met his family. hint: it was.

i'm not going to go into detail about the way they treated me, specifically his mother and sister, but it was not pleasant. his sister and i had met previously and i thought we were cool - until i met his mother. his mother and sister ganged up on me and were very mean with that uniquely acquired southern charm (y'all from the south know exactly what i am talking about). basically i ended up getting wasted and telling them they were extremely rude and said something along the lines of, ""y'all want to be southern belles, but you're disguised white trash."" umm... oops. i was so drunk that night that they called the police and i ended up in the hospital to sober up. go me. definitely not my proudest moment.

anyway, fast forward to a year later, his sister is getting married. his sister and i are cool again like when we first met. k. i asked my boyfriend last night if i was invited to the wedding. he said no because of the way i treated his family. i said, ""wait, you mean because of the way your family treated me?"" and this escalated into an argument about how i disrespected his family and he refuses to understand that i don't exactly appreciate being talked down to by his family. he then said, ""let's face it, you were never going to be invited to the wedding in the first place. our relationship was never going to be a long-term thing."" okay, well, there's a lot to unpack there, including when i helped his sister pick out wedding dresses and we talked about cakes and stuff like that. maybe she was just being polite.

but... we have also been together for more than a year and a half and live in a house (that he owns) together? there was a little bit more to this. he said, ""we have a great partnership. you're really good at cooking and cleaning and taking care of the house..."" okay, what. i didn't realize that i was your housemaid (to save our viewers from the words that i am really thinking).

then, this morning, he's acting like nothing ever happened. 

i don't know. there is probably a lot that needs clarification. but i guess i will answer those questions if they are ever asked.

"during our childhood my brother had an extremely rare toy car, i sold it for $20 and pretended i didn't know what happened to it. years later we find out it's actual worth is $150k.. the toy was a hot wheels car called the pink beach bomb. it was an ugly car and was far from his favorite. kids at my school collected hot wheels and i ended up trading that ugly pink car for $20. i didn't think anything of it at the time. there were so many people who had never seen the car and wanted it so i ended up trading it for $20.

my brother ended up asking if i'd seen it and i just lied and said i hadn't. i did feel guilty afterwards and i never did it again, but i also never told him what happened to the car. he just thought he'd lost it. we grew up and i'd forgotten about it for years up until now.

i have planned a fun romantic weekend for my girlfriend and i in denver, co. she knows of the trip but doesn't suspect a proposal at all. this woman is so perfect for me. we have had many issues to begin the relationship, often dealing with stupid fights and immaturity on both side. however, we have always remained committed to each other and most importantly willing to work on ourselves and be vulnerable about our flaws. i know a relationship and marriage is work and she is worth all of it. 

i just wanted to share with this community because i wanna shout it from the mountain tops. i hope everyone can find someone that makes them happy. love is work but it is so rewarding when it's for the right person.

"by accidentally getting my dog super, super high and incurring a $2000 vet bill before i figured out what happened.. so, before i start i want to acknowledge that i am a terrible terrible person and an irresponsible pet parent. i'm pretty much posting here because i expect reddit to tear me to pieces and i think i deserve it. everyone i tell this story to irl just laughs :(

this didn't actually happen today, it happened on friday. i was in my pool throwing balls for one of my dogs, while the other watched (he doesn't like the pool, only smelly ponds will do for swimming). his name is leo, and he is a one-year-old border collie. bouncy and adorable and loving.

he lays down by the side of the pool and i swim over to pet him. he stays lying down. this is not normal for leo. he is an excitable dog. every moment is play time. if i twitch at 3am it's omg play time now?! no leo go back to sleep. so i start calling his name and acting excited. stays lying down. barely opens his eyes. i start to worry, so i get out and walk back to the house. he can barely walk. stumbling and falling to the side. i start freaking out. i get him inside and he lies down on the floor and doesn't move. he's conscious, he hasn't collapsed, but all he'll do is open his eyes and look at me he won't get up willingly. so obviously at this point i'm freaking the fuck out. could be heatstroke, it was a warm day. but there were no signs of it, he had plenty of water and shade, and he wasn't vomiting at all. 

so i take him to my vet. they agree he's not right and want to admit him over night. but they don't have staff there overnight and i'm worrying my brains out, so i take him to the emergency vet about 40 mins away where they have 24 hour staff. i get him settled there, and then they call me and tell me they really can't work out what's wrong, all his tests are normal. not dehydrated, liver and kidney function are fine. heart rate's a bit slow but not terribly. but he won't wake up and if he's forced to walk he falls.

so they say they're really worried about him, and they want me to take him to the specialists about an hour away. i inwardly cry, because my other dog has had a stay there before and it's expensive. but a pet parent's gotta do what a pet parents gotta do. so off we go.

we get to the specialist. it's about midnight by this point. i'm exhausted and tearful with worry. they admit him and send me home. over the next few days, he has every test known to man. all normal. he has about 10 different neurological exams. normal. he seems to be slowly improving day by day. on monday they say i might as well take him home, he seems to be improving and they're waiting on some more tests results. basically, there's nothing they can do right now that i can't do at home.

over and over again they've asked if he could have gotten access to any toxins. and over and over again i say no. nothing. he's been with me all day. i can't think of anything he could have gotten into.

then on monday it hit me. i had been cleaning out the outside freezer, and caught him with his head in the trash bag. i shooed him away and thought nothing of it. it was just old food with freezer burn. nothing that could hurt him. then i remember. i used to store edibles in that freezer. strong edibles. my first batch before i figured out doses. one chocolate would knock me on my ass for a day. my usual dose was 1/4 a chocolate.

he must have eaten one. the poor little fucker was high as a kite for three days.

happy to say it's been five days now and he's right as rain. currently demanding i throw balls for him in spite of a three hour walk this morning.

but ... fuck. i feel fucking terrible. i poisoned my dog :( poor little dude.

"my 28/m mother in law 55/f opened up several credit cards in my wife's 28/f name and now we can't buy a house.. pretty short and sweet but my mother-in-law has completely screwed us out of a chance to buy a house in the next year or two. after 3 years of saving up money for a big down payment, furniture, etc. we've now learned my wife's credit is in the toilet because her mom defaulted on 3 credit cards two years ago. when my wife confronted her about it, she kept saying she was sorry but she was going through a tough time. she's offered to pay the entire amount (around $3000) back in a lump sum but that doesn't erase the bad credit score. she has also asked my wife not to bring it up to her siblings. it just seems like shes aloof about this whole situation. is there anything that can be done to make her realize how much she has screwed us over?

edit: wow this blew up! i talked with my wife about it over lunch and she's willing to go to the police. i'm going to copy/paste a reply (nevermind removed it) below because it's seriously amazing advice and probably just saved us from having to forego a house.

"i just found out my boyfriend of 5 months is married and my best friend knew all along.. so last year my best friend asked me to accompany her to visit her boyfriend for a few days. he had a roommate so she took me along. once i met him, we immediately hit it off and had a great time for the two days we stayed over. after returning to my place we kept in touch constantly and after a few months became official.

i was so deeply into this guy and honestly thought he was the one. last night there was a photo of him tagged on facebook with another lady holding a baby, and all the comments are complimenting them on  what a wonderful family it is. i was a bit confused so i asked my friend and she goes ""oh yeah _her guy_ told me he has a wife he's hardly committed to and a kid""

my head was spinning, i can hardly think or do anything. it's so painful i never knew i would be this affected. i've confronted the guy and he's so apologetic claiming he never really got the right time to tell me.

i'm so pissed off at both my friend and the guy i've cut ties with both of them. my friend's excuse is that she thought it was his place to tell me. what kind of an excuse is that?

then i asked her how tall she was, sure enough, she was only about 5ft2, to which i basically replied mocking her for going after tall guys, and i called her a ""picky midget"", which maybe was a bit out of line. anyway, i started goofing on her, making a bunch of jokes about footstools, and calling her out for having those preferences. also, she isn't the thinnest girl around, not fat or whatever, but anyway, i jokingly asked her what a fat girl was doing using numbers as dealbreakers, and she called me an asshole and unmatched.

"by removing my diva cup. nsfw. after getting tired of shoving bits of cotton in my 'nanner curtains for years, i switched to the menstrual cup a while back. *for those that don't know, it's basically this little silicone cup you pop into your lady bits and you can wear for like 12 hours.*

anywhoo, after sleeping all night, i needed to empty it. i headed to the bathroom, lined the toilet with toilet paper to prevent splash back, and proceeded to remove it. now, i always look to see how full the cup is after removal. it's a weird thing to do, but i think it's kinda cool to see how much is in there. 

apparently, unbeknownst to me, my bathroom spider bro was also interested in my red water tidings. as i was removing the cup, he dropped down to check out the situation. not expecting a spider to the face that early in the morning, i jerked back, shrieked, and fell off the toilet.

 remember what was in my hand? yeah, it was a full cup. **everywhere.** on the tub, on the wall, all over me, it was a mess.

"i (27f) found out my boyfriend (33m) is not divorced or childless when i told him i was pregnant.. i'm a mess and on mobile so i'm sorry if this makes no sense. my boyfriend of almost 2 years has essentially been living a double life. i'm baffled as to how he pulled this off. when we met, he told me he was on the tail end of a nasty lengthy divorce, but that he had moved on and it would never pose an issue, and until now he was right, it never has. last week i took a pregnancy test that came back positive, and yesterday morning i had a obgyn visit to confirm. i was honestly ecstatic, i've always wanted to be a mom and my boyfriend felt the same, we talked about our future children many times even though we haven't been together for the longest time. i was really excited to tell him that night when he came over for dinner, but his reaction was... weird. his face went pale and he looked confused, not what i expected at all, and he got up to go to the bathroom. when he came back he was really calm and really serious, and he told me that he was really afraid and didn't know how me and our baby would factor into his life, and he made the decision to come clean. not only is he nowhere near being divorced from his wife, who he's been with for close to a decade, but they have 2 kids together, 4 and 6. i have no idea how i never had even a clue, he works a lot and really early, which is the reason he would rarely spend nights over. that being said, it's not like he hardly spent any time with me. i'm heartbroken and confused and his confession left me with absolutely no idea what to do. i'm still pregnant, with his third child, and he's still very much married. he left right after that conversation, and i've called and texted but the only response i've gotten is that he'll speak to me tomorrow night after work. his demeanor is so cold and unfamiliar that i'm terrified he's going to leave me to figure out this pregnancy on my own. another part of me doesn't want him anymore. if he's this good of a liar, what else has he lied about? what else could he lie about? i also would hate to break up a family like this. i feel disgusted in this whole situation, i've never felt more alone and confused. should i be preemptive and leave him or are there other ways i could go about this?

update: i think it's clear that i need to leave him, but that's about all that's clear for me right now. i want to be a mom, but these are the worst circumstances for that that i can imagine. i'm trying to think of ways to contact his wife and can't think of any. i do believe i was at the house where they once lived at one point, but he has moved since then (allegedly) so i have no idea what the new address is. i can't seem to piece this together at all. i don't understand how i was fooled for so long, i think i'm still in shock. to recap, i am leaving, i'm not sure if i want to abort, and as much as i want to tell his wife i have no way of doing that. i guess i'll wait until he speaks with me tomorrow. thank you guys, if you'd like updates i'll keep posting.

update 2: i found his wife through a website someone sent me. he wasn't lying when he said he had no social media, but she does. seeing the pictures of them made me realize i cannot keep our child, his family is beautiful and it breaks my heart to know he could do this to them, i cannot have the father of my child be someone like him. i still have no idea how to tell his wife.",7

"by probably ruining a girl's life, forever, via capture the flag.. today i fucked up. there's a girl in my ecology class. let's call her ""madge"". madge is your go-getting try-hard holier-than-thou know-it-all with an unchanging facial expression i can only describe as ""cat trying to shit a peach pit"". one of those constant-frowners, and constant-downers. 

i even tried to get along with madge at the start; i'd sit by her and try to engage her (read: humor her) with conversations in relevant topics about ecology, such as the thrilling handedness of apes or edge-of-your-seat songbird plumage complexity, but just trying to be civil was a futile endeavour. expecting madge to be civil with you because you were civil with her is like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn't eat it. madge was born to be an asshole.

everything you said to her was met with a ""pffft"", or a dramatic roll of the eyes, and a quick retort such as ""well, if you'd actually *read* carter et al. 2007, you would have known that..."" she had to be better and smarter than everyone, at everything, all the time. and boy, that shit got real old, real quick. so i stopped sitting by her. and began to loathe her. with a pre-occupied disposition. i thought about her twice today before even writing this, that's how much i don't like her.

fast forward to the first capture the flag game of the year. being a freshman, i thought i'd attend as a way to get out of my residence room and meet some people. the first game was at about 8:00pm, the campus was already dark, and i showed up just wearing shorts and a t-shirt. out of 150+ people (who knew capture the flag was so popular?) i ended up being possibly the most under-dressed person there. camouflage, ghillie suits, face-paint, and black morph costumes were just some of the norm. this was like capture the flag olympics. 

teams were divided into short sleeve vs. long sleeve, and the ""flags"" were two bicycle lights. i began to mingle with fellow short-sleeves... and that's when i saw her. madge. black boots, black pants, black turtleneck, black scarf, black cap, black gloves. she was going all call of duty for this game -- of course. why wouldn't she be a try-hard at capture the flag too? and i just knew i'd have to tag her the fuck out. this was my chance to prove i was better at something.

the first few rounds, us short-sleeves did terribly because no one stayed behind to defend, so we lost 3 rounds promptly. each time they blew the whistle, i could hear madge laughing. i could hear it. so i switched to defense. to prevent ""camping"", there was a 50 meter buffer around each ""flag"". conveniently for me, there was a group of hedges 50 meters away from my flag. so i hid in the hedges.

each time anyone from the other team tried to sneak up to our flag, i'd jump out of the hedges, startle the hell out of them, and that would give me the time i needed to run up and tag them out. i'd probably tagged out 8-10 people in about 15 minutes, when the stars aligned, and i saw her. madge. walking through the shadows along the side of a building, headed straight for our flag, thinking she was so sneaky with all her matching black gear. this was it. it was *my time to shine*.

but i was too excitable. i bounded from the hedges like sea biscuit while she was still a good 40-50 feet away. so i yelled ""aaaaarrgh!"" to try to emphasize the startling effect. she shrieked in surprise, but without missing a beat, she spun around 180 degrees and headed back for her ""side"" at a dead sprint. i then realized that if she got to her side before i caught her, she'd be ""out of play"" and i couldn't tag her out -- that was an impossible embarrassment, i couldn't allow it. i took off too, at a dead sprint. like gimli, i'm not so much for long runs, but dangerous across short distances. i was gaining on her, and now confidently puffed up, with a laugh i shouted ""you can run if you want, i'll just catch you when you're tired!""

the chase lasted probably 100-150 feet before she tripped on a tree root and fell pretty hard, but made no attempt to get back up. as i got closer, i realized she had stooped to a whole new low - playing the crying game, surely exaggerating an injury that would thus make my ""tagging"" of her distasteful. but then as i got closer still, i realized she was *really* crying, like *hysterically* crying. i was still mad, so as i got up to her i said ""crying won't fucking help"", at which point she rolled on to her back and looked up at me and shouted ""get the fuck away!"". i leaned down to make eye contact and said ""it's just a fucking game"", to which she cocked an eyebrow and said ""what the fuck are you talking about?!""

and then it hit me.

i did not recognize this girl.

*this was not madge.*

this was some girl walking to the bus station after a night class.

horrified, mouth hanging open, the rolodex of my mind spun as i suddenly imagined what it must have been like from her perspective: a large, strange, bearded, sweaty, under-dressed man jumped out of the bushes screaming ""aaarrrrrrrgh!"", and when she ran, he ran too, screaming ""you can run if you want, i'll just catch you when you're tired"", and when he saw her crying, said ""crying won't fucking help"".

i wanted to apologize, i wanted to introduce myself, i wanted to explain, but all i could get out was ""hey... sorry -- it was, it's just... hi, i'm... hey, you know, capture the flag?... please don't call the police, this was all a misunderstanding"" and then i ran away hoping she hadn't seen enough of my face to create a composite sketch for campus security.

i never ended up tagging her, or madge for that matter, and i never went back to capture the flag after that (i hear it may be getting cancelled) but i probably caused some seriously deep-seated anxieties about night classes that will haunt that poor girl forever.

dear night class girl, if you're a redditor, i am so sorry. i'm actually a pretty nice guy, really.

tl;dr - today i fucked up by wanting to get back at a snooty know-it-all from ecology class by chasing her down at a night game of capture the flag only to realize i'd chased down (and probably subsequently scarred) some girl from night class who wasn't even playing.

**edit:** wow, thanks for the reddit gold, guys - i'd say ""you surprised me and popped my gold cherry"" but that expression would seem to be in poor taste after my story. 

**edit:** i never realized how much i made it sound like she broke her neck at first. holy shit. also, i laughed my ass off at how many people say there's sexual tension between me and madge. fucking madge.      ... but maybe there is tension. maybe i am in love with her... holy shit my whole life has been a lie! jk lol i really still hate her.

"""don't bring your screaming kids to a movie for teens and adults"" should not be a controversial opinion.. i saw someone earlier today getting blasted on twitter for saying that parents should not bring their kids to avengers endgame if they can't keep them silent throughout the 3h runtime and i honestly have no understanding for this. 

movie theaters are a place where shutting up and not annoying others should be common decency and thinking that it's okay for your kids to disrupt that just because the movie running isn't schindler's list is just assholish behavior.

"just because the rich earn a lot of money doesn't mean you are entitled to any of it. seeing calls for a 70% tax rate on highest earners really pisses me off. it is disgusting. how would you like it if someone took 70% of your wages? you wouldn't. 

that money isn't yours to take, it isn't the government's to take, it is 100% owned by the person who earned it. should you pay tax for the government to protect you? yes. an absolute maximum of 45% for the highest earners should go to the taxman, ensuring that the country you earn your millions in is well defended and well built.

calling for a 70% tax rate is a horrible thing, called for only by the most selfish and envious of people who are jealous of those who have it better in life. what gives you the right to take nearly 3/4 of someone elses stuff?

and for context, i earn $22/hr at my job in australia. i don't earn an incredible amount of money, so no i'm not some rich asshole complaining about the help.

edit: i am seeing a lot of comments telling me i don't understand tax or i don't care about the poor. 

1. i agree with the idea that once you have a certain amount of capitol you should start spending your money as it's your responsibility to stimulate the economy. however, at the end of the day, it's your money and you choose whether or not to spend it. so no, you shouldn't have dormant money taxed.


2. the irony is some people with enough disposable income have thrown me platinum and silver. the system works.

"by not disconnecting from the bluetooth. i live with four roommates in college and we often throw big parties. tonight they had a ton of people over from their high school some of which i knew, some of which i didn't. i decided to chat for a few minutes, then turn in early for bed. 

i was talking to this one girl (amanda)(not her real name) who i'd met a few times before through my roommates. always thought she was cute, and especially tonight. we chatted for about an hour, and we really got along, i thought about asking her out. 

before i worked up the courage her friends arrived and she dipped to chat with them. i decided that'd be my cue to call it a night, and i went upstairs to bed. 

and, like many men out there on the internet, i often partake in a particular activity before sleeping, especially if i've been drinking, which i was. and i pulled up this girls ig for... inspiration. (call me a peeve, i don't care. i'm sure i'm about to be called everything by my friends)). she had a video showing herself jumping into a pool in a bikini. her friend counted down and then she jumped off the diving board. i watched it four or five times with the sound on low, and then switched over to a porn app that plays video. 

*but here's the thing.* as we were chatting, amanda borrowed my phone to connect to the houses bluetooth stereo and play one of her favorite songs. (i told you, our conversation had been going well.) and after that song was over i just put on a spotify playlist and didn't think anything more of it. 

except these videos were playing through the stereo now. so amanda's bikini video played 4 or 5 times, immediately followed by some pretty hardcore porn. i realized it after about 10 seconds into the second video, but everybody heard and stopped talking downstairs. and then about 10 seconds after that the conversation slowly picked up again.

so now i can just hope amanda doesn't recognize her own instagram video by audio. and that still doesn't really help me from the whole porn side of it. 

tdlr - didn't disconnect from the bluetooth and played girls ig and then porn over whole party. definitely ruined my chances with that girl, who i was chatting with. 



edit - gonna take some sleeping pills and chalk this one up to an l. gonna figure this shit out in the morning.

edit 2 - woke up to a bunch of texts, mostly people asking where i was, nobody directly asked me about the stereo thing. nothing from amanda.

edit 3 - casually asked my roommate about this morning as he was headed out the door. think i'm in the clear, at least with the general party - sounds like they figured it was one of my other roommates pulling a prank, which tbh this is in his wheelhouse for pranks. he denied it obviously but nobody believes him. think things are ok. i don't know what amanda thinks, since she took my phone and *shes* the one who connected to the bluetooth, and she's probably the only one who recognizes that video, if she even heard it. 

i have a general medium-grade anxiety from the whole thing but i guess if that's my punishment im ok.

edit 4 - she blocked me on ig.

edit 5 - aforementioned roommate found this post. he found it hilarious and told me to keep it up. we laughed about it for awhile. he's better connected to amanda and is going to try to ask around to see what she knows. nothing to lose at this point 🤷‍♂️

edit 6 - well, you guys aren't going to believe this one. turns out she was flattered, the ig block was an accident, and we have a date next week!!

lol, jk. she thinks i'm a fucking creep and probably won't be coming around anymore. told her friends, now that's my reputation with that whole group of people. leaving the post up cause i don't think i can fall any further and at least people are having fun here. i'm going to go for a walk.",4
"men an women are not, never have been, and never will be equals.. men and women are biological opposites, and therefore not possibly equals. i do believe in equal rights, ofc. but if youre telling me that i'm supposed to pretend that your average woman can match the average man's strength... or that your average man can a womans detailed memory, youre just out of your mind.

"if someone becomes immunized, and you receive their blood, do you then become immunized?. say i receive the yellow fever vaccine and have enough time to develop antibodies (ab) to the antigens there-within. then later, my friend, who happens to be the exact same blood type, is in a car accident and receives 2 units of my donated blood. 

would they then inherit my ab to defend themselves against yellow fever? or does their immune system immediately kill off my antibodies? 
(or does donated blood have ab filtered out somehow and i am ignorant of the process?)

if they do inherit my antibodies, is this just a temporary effect as they don't have the memory b cells to continue producing the antibodies for themselves? or do the b cells learn and my friend is super cool and avoided the yellow fever vaccine shortage?

"i've been lurking a long time and have learned a lot from this community. just wanted to give back a little!. \*edit: putting this closer to the top: to use it for yourself, go to ""file > make a copy"" or ""download"" if you would prefer it in excel.

made an amortization schedule to calculate a few specific things when throwing a little extra money here and there at loans. things like how much time the loan is reduced by, new last payment date, and the amount of interest saved over the life of the loan. (i know there's resources of a lot of this here already, but here it is anyway, all in one place.)

most calculators i've found only allow input for a set additional payment, assumed monthly. i wanted to be able to include inconsistent amounts for times i fall into a little more money than usual, like a tax return or work bonus, or times i might want to skip an additional payment for whatever reason. it includes side-by-side calculations of no-extra-principal-payments and extra-principal-payments for easy comparison and good feels. it also keeps track of where you're at in the schedule, with a simple highlight. duplicate tabs for multiple loans.

just fill in the grey ""inputs"" and the most-right column as necessary, everything else is done for you (: i hope this helps someone! thank you again for all the advice, insights, and general goodwill over the years! enjoy!

"if teenagers are not allowed to have a vasectomy they should not be allowed to go on hormone therapy before age 18. doctors can be incredibly patronizing towards young men and women, even those already in their twenties, when they decide to have have a vasectomy or have their tubes tied at an early age. especially when these people do not have a family already. /r/childfree is full of people who have a hard time getting sterilized despite being very clear about these desires.

however a sixteen year old can go on hormone treatment which also causes sterility and it's legally allowed and considered medically and ethnically correct. how is this not a double standard? one might argue that children cannot oversee the effects of their choices at a young age.

how many people haven't been young and wanted vastly different things in life from what they wanted later on? it's incredibly irresponsible to allow children to make irreversible choices for their future at an age where very few children are aware of the effects. for certain life changing decisions  you should be at least 18.",6
"for not consulting my roommate about some of the things i do to the dorm. hello! i posted here before about this girl before because she used to constantly have the heat on in summer. we got that worked out but now everything else is a problem.

i just started college as a freshman at an art school and they gave us the option to join dorms that had our interests and find people to live with who are like us. our dorm is like an apartment, with two rooms that two people share. the rooms are a bit small but the living room is a big empty space with a couch and a sad little table. 

me and 2 other girls got put into this dorm for gamers and then we had a guy as our 4th so they had to switch us for this last girl very quickly. she's nothing like us, which wouldn't be an issue if she wasn't how she is. 

the first issue that i had with her was the fact that she had the heat on in the dorm, but she got a heater for herself and that got worked out. 
the school has a wall in each dorm that they specifically let us draw on, it's strange but i like it. the 3 of us are illustration majors while this girl is a photography major. we started drawing on our wall and this girl made a fit about it, saying how we didn't ask if she'd be okay with it. 

she had a 'meeting' with us where she complained that we made the living room a 'gaming room' because my roommate brought her monitor out and plugged in my switch and we played super smash bros one night. it was super fun to me

this girl has had friends over but complains when i have mine over, and i heard her talking to her friends about us. i have a class with one of her friends and he just kinda gives me weird looks the whole time. when me and my roommate were walking, her friends were sitting on a bench talking and when we walked by they all stoped talking and gave us weird looks again. 

she's vegan, and yesterday sent a long message about how when we make meat we need to clean extremely well for her in the kitchen and stuff, which i understand but it was just so annoying how she she wrote it. 

well, last night i bought a fluffy black rug for the living room in our dorm. i thought it would look nice because of the big empty space. this girl went off. she said black is ugly and hides dirt, and i should have consulted everyone when getting a rug. i got this rug because me and the two other roommates went to target and she didn't wanna come with, and when we saw rugs we thought it would be cool to get one for the living room. when i was out, i picked one up with everyone's happiness in mind. i told her ""nobody consulted me over the dish soap"" and left. that was probably a bad thing to say but i was mad and sad.

she sent me a long text this morning about how i'm nasty for the soap and the black rug and immature and all these things. i'm just hurt honestly, but maybe i'm the asshole and she's reasonable.

am i the asshole?

update: i walked into the living room yesterday to the rug rolled up in a ball, so i just decided to put it in a corner as i didn't want to cause more drama. i sent her a message apologising and asking if we could talk like adults and she's been blatantly ignoring me and being very friendly in our roommate group chat as well as to the others in general. it's hard to just let this go as it makes me feel like trash. i genuinely miss living alone.

edit: i emailed the ra for my floor and he and i talked about the issues i was having, hopefully we'll have a dorm meeting with an ra to help and if she wants there's an option for her to move to a different dorm

edit 2: telling me to drop out of art school is not helpful in any way and your opinion is not wanted. i worked hard to get here and my college tuition was paid for by scholarships and the generosity of others. please respect my decision to be here.",3
"i was almost raped tonight.. i was just taking recycling out to the bins outside my apartment, maybe 7-8 feet from my back door. i didn't see which direction he came from, but suddenly there was a gun in my face and a man in a ski mask told me i was ""coming with him."" he pushed the gun into my back and ordered me to walk down the alleyway into my neighbors' backyard. i offered him my phone but he told me to shut up and keep walking. once in the dark space between the garbage bins and the garage, he told me to take my shoes off and get on the ground. the whole time, i stayed the calmest i think i've ever been. i have no idea how, but i think it's one of the things that saved my life. i didn't try to fight, and i did what he told me to do.

if it wasn't for the motion sensor lights on the garage, i know he would have raped and/or killed me. they were triggered by me stumbling, and he was scared off. i ran into the building, which was thankfully unlocked, and called 911. a woman came out of the nearest apartment because she heard me knocking and screaming. she and her so were really nice and helpful and kept their door open for me until after the police arrived. i spent almost two hours with officers and sensitive crimes detectives before finally coming back home. i'm still a bit in shock that it happened at all. i live in a decently sized city that people typically say is dangerous, but i stupidly thought my neighborhood was safe.

i posted this to get it off my chest but also as a warning to everyone to just always be careful. i was outside for maybe 30 seconds before this happened. i was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and i don't want anyone else to be in the same position. also, motion sensor lights are great. thank you for listening.",11

"20+ years later, still paying for the mistakes of my youth. i'm trying to figure out if there's anything i can do here short of applying for a pardon and hoping for the best.

i live in michigan, usa.  in 1996-97 when i was 18-19 years old, i was charged with a pair of felonies and a misdemeanor, all in separate incidents because i was young, stupid, and made poor decisions.  destruction of property, theft of items from a motor vehicle over $5.00, and retail fraud (forgot to pay for gas at the gas station).  the latter of the offenses was a legitimate mistake on my part but that really doesn't matter.  the court cases for all three went pretty much the same way.  court appointed attorney recommended a guilty plea and he would petition for the minimum sentence.  stupid decisions on my part all around, but he did what he said and i served no jail time, received no probation, no community service.  i paid restitution and court costs totaling less than $1000, much of which was restitution for the window that i broke.

none of these details matter much in the grand scheme of things.  the fact is that, because i have two felonies on my record, getting either of them expunged is out of the question.  i feel like i've more than paid my debt to society for these mistakes but i am constantly reminded that i will continue paying for these mistakes.

i work in it security as a consultant and while my employer is aware of my past, we will occasionally have clients request or perform their own background checks.  this creates a problem for me at work as i am unable to work with certain clients (law enforcement, government, gaming, etc.) and i can't help but feel at some point, my employer will become tired of dealing with this restriction.

i'm unable to officially be involved in anything school related with my two children.  what i mean by this is that coaching, chaperoning, or any other involvement is prohibited because of my felonies.  i was informed of this years ago when i simply picked my oldest son up from school and filled out paperwork to be able to do so, including fingerprints.  i received a letter a couple of weeks later stating that, while i was not restricted from picking my son up from school, dropping him off, or entering the school, i was not allowed to accompany him on class field trips, coach any sports, or be otherwise involved in any school functions as a volunteer due to my criminal history.  trying to explain to a 6 year old why his father can't coach his baseball team when he knows that i played baseball in college or that i can't go on his field trip to the zoo with him and watching his heart break each and every time kills me.  both of my boys are old enough that i've now explained things to them, but that doesn't repair the damage i feel like i caused during their childhood by not being able to do those things.

these are just a few of the many ways this impacts my life on what seems like a daily basis.  i guess this post really has two purposes.  1) to see if there's anything else i can do short of applying for a pardon and 2) to serve as a cautionary tale.  everyone makes mistakes.  some of them, no matter how insignificant they may seem at the time, will stick with you for the rest of your life.

edit:  thank you all for the wonderful comments and suggestions.  i have reached out to an attorney and will be working with them to try and clear this up.  i truly appreciate each and every one of your comments, advice, and words of encouragement.  i had no idea what to expect when i posted this.  i was hoping for, at the very least, a single piece of advice that i could use.  out of the well over 100 comments and messages i've received in response to this, exactly two have been negative responses.  everything else has been extremely positive and i thank each and every one of you for it.

"(update #2) that dude who used to be locked in chastity. ~~so, this will be my final post before i get rid of this throwaway account forever.~~ i'll make this short and simple. i found out my wife was cheating - multiple text messages, voicemails, emails... and pictures from her cell phone all confirming this. 

got a lawyer, made backups of all evidence, told her nothing of what i know. she cried and asked why i asked for a divorce. my answer ""i don't trust you and i do not love you anymore. my lawyer will be in contact with you."" i moved out to an efficiency apartment and left the car that was in her name. i'm taking the bus to work now.

i'll rebuild my life. my lawyer guarantees this will be the easiest alimony case he'll ever have (after the overwhelming evidence) but possibly not custody of my children. i never mentioned the chastity to the lawyer... it's the ace up my sleeve, but i've got audio of her demanding i put it on.... at the very least i'll have full visitation rights. (and her making 5 times what i make, she can't squeeze child support out of me more than she will be paying me).

so, i'm sitting in my living room on a folding chair watching hulu on my laptop and eating pizza out of the cardboard box. i've got a case of beer and a space heater next to me and i'm fucking happy.... i just wanted to thank all of you for helping me overcome my issues.

"i can't wait to propose to my gf. she sent me two selfies a little bit ago and i just stopped and stared at them for a while and everything hit me all at once.  all of the feelings of being with her.

"flmiamiupdatebeing sued for having topless photos of a minor in my bar who claimed to be 21. thank you very much to everyone who responded. i really appreciate your all giving up time to do this. this is part update (first chunk) and then answers to questions (second chunk). 

so i lawyered up with a decent firm i've used before, and a day or two subsequently i was officially served with notice i am being sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

i didn't state it in my first post because i thought it was not relevant but if any of the girls want to remove their poster they just need to let me know and it will be taken down immediately – although obviously they lose their free month of drinks. this is clearly written on the form they signed, which they all have a copy of. so i knew from the start it wasn't a case of regret and the girl wanting the poster down. 

one of the first things my lawyer did was check with the girl's firm if it was real and not a scam as several posters had suggested. unfortunately, it was a real case, they provided all the documentation and stuff. it gets worse. they also sent him a scan of the girl's passport and birth certificate when he asked, both confirming she is 16. they'll be brought up in the lawsuit so there's no question of them also being fakes. i checked her real info provided by the lawyers and compared it with the form and as i now know fake driving license she gave me. she used the same address on the fake id but just changed her last name. it is clearly the same girl in both photos. 

she doesn't want to bring the police into it and wants just a civil case. my lawyer met with hers and, just as /u/thewhitenashorne and other fl attorneys had suggested, made noise about how her possessing a fake id is a felony and how about she just drop the suit and we stay even stevens unless she wants the police involved, but her lawyer basically told mine that it would be far worse for me if we got the police involved because of it being a naked minor, and also the threat of having my liquor license taken away, like basically as my lawyer explained it they have two cards to play (photos of a minor naked, potential confiscation of liquor license) and i have one of a much lower value (girl has a fake id that's only a dl, not a passport or green card).  

anyway, i have removed the poster and have locked it and the memory card with all the photos in the safe. 

i have had warnings in the past at the first bar i owned to id more strictly (i'm from europe where we're more relaxed) and at this one too but we ask for a driving license/passport for everyone now so the police are happy. the guy telling me i accept fake ids is wrong: i just do the bare minimum when it comes to accepting licenses because my business is serving alcohol to college kids, not being border patrol.  to the poster who asked, i have no idea whether or not it is allowed but loads of fl clubs and bars confiscate fake id, particularly during spring break. 

to reiterate since some people were double checking this – yes, i collected and photocopied id from all of the girls concerned alongside the forms they filled out. it is easy to match the forms with the relevant posters since i can compare the id and the poster photo. 

i have notified the photographer although he is not named in the lawsuit. he told me he has insurance against this exactly for this sort of thing (he's an erotic photographer) so wasn't too bothered as i had done checks and asked for id. the photos weren't in his online portfolio as i had paid extra so i had sole ownership of the photos – he has no copies. 

i have checked with my insurers who will indeed cover this. the fact i have consent forms and proof of age made them and my lawyer a lot more happy. 

while some bars do indeed let younger people in, my bar's policy is always 21+ only. the only way that girl got in was with a fake id – she should not have been there legally. 

on an non legal point – i have received several abusive pms about this competition, calling me a paedo, a rapist, a ""scumsucking sleazoid"" and so on. this competition was completely legal and completely consensual. i have run these sorts of competitions before in my bar every couple of years and have never had any problems yet. i appreciate that the bars some of you may frequent are not run on the same model or are higher class that mine, but bars like mine work this way. cheap alcohol at a bar near frat and sorority houses means i make a killing and this just encourages business. if you disapprove that i don't own an expensive trendy hipster bar aimed at young professionals, serving pumpkin spiced craft beer with lena dunham quotes on the walls, just ignore the post. don't pm me a load of self moralising abusive bullshit.

i have also received two pms asking me where exactly my bar is in miami since they fancy coming for a drink. it doesn't seem wise to reveal this stuff on the web – particularly in the middle of all this -  so sorry, no. 

that's all for now. obviously if anything happens i will update at the end of the case. my lawyer has said i should hold fire on updating you till then. thank you all once again for your help.

"i 22f just found out my boyfriend 27f has been having sex with me when i'm sleeping after i've taken sleeping pills.. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bsfbde/update_i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27m_has/)

my boyfriend and i have been together for a couple of years now. our sex life is good. i have no complaints. don't think he does either. we sleep together multiple times a week. i hardly ever refuse him when he initiates because i have quite a high sex drive.  i rarely refuse him because i'm not in the mood. 

i do occasionally say no because i have insomnia and occasionally take medication. the medications knock me out so hard that you could probably do surgery on me and i wouldn't wake up. because of this, if i have taken my meds i'll not sleep with him because of the reaction i have. i wouldn't want to fall asleep on him.

well a couple of days ago i was feeling unwell and did refuse him. i went to sleep and all was well until i was awoken about an hour later with my boyfriend inside me and kissing my neck. i went into panic at first because i didn't realize it was him and i felt a little trapped.

when i asked what he was doing his response was that he thought i had taken my meds. when i asked again he admitted that he has done it before and didn't think it was a big deal because we have woken each other up with oral sex before (i will add that we have pretty much ongoing consent that either of us can wake the other up with oral sex in the mornings). i explicitly told him no before i went to to sleep. i was shocked and still am a little rattled.

he still doesn't think it's a big deal because i wasn't awake for it. he thinks i'm overreacting. but to me, if he thought it was okay then he would have outright told me he had one it the first time he did it. the fact that he's done it multiple time just doesn't sit right with me. and the fact that he pretty much waited until i drugged myself to do it as well. it makes me feel a little icky and gross. i can't describe it.

i don't know what to say to him. any advice?

tl;dr i have insomnia so have to take meds to help me sleep. these meds knock me out so hard that i'm pretty much dead to the world. while i've been drugged my boyfriend has been sleeping with me, even after i explicitly told him no before i fell asleep he thinks it's no big deal and that i'm overreacting.",7

"update: charged $1700 for lab work that insurance denied as medically unnecessary. fixed!. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az3yna/doctor_sent_me_to_get_bloodwork_at_an_innetwork/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

edit: this is in california

i just wanted to start of by saying thank you to everyone who commented and gave advice! i really appreciate all the help. 

here's what i ended up doing:

i called my own insurance company to find out why it was denied. i found out that, because of my dad's specific insurance plan, i was supposed to go to a specific doctor's office and lab for my yearly checkup and bloodwork that is near my parent's house because the insurance has a specific contract with them. i didn't go there because i live a few hundred miles away. however, my address is listed as my parent's address so the insurance company thought i lived nearby. they said i could appeal with an address change but the woman on the phone was very upfront and said that those never get approved. she said that, if i could get my doctor to change the billing code (just like all of you said!! you noble wonderful people) then the insurance company would review it. she also said that the old code had to be removed and a new one put in place. the new billing couldn't have both codes on it. 

so! i went to my doctors office and brought in my bill. the admin at the front was so sympathetic and understanding and promised to take care of it within the next few days. i told her everything hat the insurance lady told me, and she wrote it all down and clipped it to a copy of my bill. she said that the diagnostics place never even sent them my results! by that friday, she had gotten my results and had me come in to find what they were, resubmitted he claim to insurance, and put a hold on all payments until it was figured out. 

today, i got my new bill in the mail. all of the bloodwork was covered. my new bill is $0.00.  i cried all over the place, you guys. 

i'm planning on bringing that admin a thank-you card and maybe a starbucks card and flowers. hopefully she's allowed to take them. 

thank you all so much for all of your advice and help. you are all the best!! you literally helped me from having to pay 10% of my yearly wages! plus, i started saving up in preparation for having to pay this bill so now i have the beginnings of a little nest egg/emergency fund just in case something happens in the future. again, you guys rock.

"nc employer drug tested me, and also gave me a pregnancy test...?. i've been with my company for 2 years now. i recently applied for a different position, and got it. we're required to submit to a drug test any time we change positions, which is fine, i wasn't worried.

our drug tests are done in house. yesterday, i went to give my urine specimen, and was told by the hr woman to just leave it in the bathroom and go back to work, that she would check it in a second. 

today, i get to work and my supervisor congratulates me on being pregnant, and tells me they'll be speaking to me about the position later. bewildered, i asked what she meant. apparently i was not only tested for drugs, but given a pregnancy test (not sure how, unless they literally dipped a stick in or used a dropper after the fact?) without my consent/knowledge. 

i left work almost immediately and bought tests on the way home. i am indeed pregnant and have no desire to keep it, and will be scheduling an abortion asap. 

the other issue is that my supervisor knows. i don't know who else. unless i fake a miscarriage, they'll know i aborted and that seems like a ton of workplace drama i should have been able to avoid. 

is this legal? what are my options here? i'm afraid when i go back to work, it'll be all over the factory and i'll have to figure out a lie.",2

"friend got two charges for drinking in my yard. my friend left my house around 2am, said goodbye to another friend, then began to walk home. he noticed a cop and decided to stay put a second - he sat down on a couch we have outside. eventually, the cop comes up and begins questioning him. the cop even went as far as saying ""this isn't you"" when he showed him his id and verbally harassing him. two more cops come, they go back and forth, but they end up handcuffing him and booking him. 

he got two charges, ""disorderly prowling"" and ""open alcohol in public"". i'm helping him contest this because i think it's bullshit that these cops harassed him like that, there was 0 disorderly prowling (unless that's what you call a black man walking home) and this was all right outside of my house and in my yard, minutes after i went to bed.

"the three month rule. years ago, as i was first starting on my journey to financial stability, i had a problem with impulsive buying. not expensive things, but they would add up. so i came up with a rule for myself: i need to **want it** for more than three months before i would buy it.

this worked well, and i have since changed my behavior so much that i don't even need to follow the rule anymore. i can instantly sense when it's an impulsive buy, and when it's something i really believe would improve my life satisfaction.

so, after reading this sub for a while now, i'm curious if you have some similar rules of thumb for yourself. not necessarily for impulsive buys, but perhaps for other venues of personal finance management. something we could all learn from?
if so, please share.

---

edit: wow, so many different responses, i can't keep track anymore. thank you for all your feedback. so far i've gotten a lot of good comments.

in a nutshell, these are the best ideas i could find in the feed:

- for every 100 dollars spent do that amount of hours to do the research (100 dollars = 1 hour)

- walk around the store with the item before you buy it, called ""walking the item"" - this was the funniest one

- use wishlists to defer decision to a later time

- spending in terms of days of retirement (would i rather buy $100 item or retire two days early?)

- thinking in terms of hours worked (i need to work for x amount of hours to buy this. is it worth it?)

- a variation on the above one, where you first deduct your living expenses, what remains you calculate into hourly wage that you *really* have at your disposal and only then consider how many hours you need to work for it

- buying only after running x number of miles (works both for impulse buys and getting yourself in shape)

- the old 'if you can't afford two of those, you can't afford one' was very common and very popular (a variation on this with a 3x approach(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ktr6u/the_three_month_rule/djq4357/))

- a lot of jokes how you can't do this with food (teasing me about the three month thing)

- and other that said they do that for food as well (obviously not in terms of not eating, but rather in terms of eating certain junk foods they like)

- buy memories, not things

- practicing artificial scarcity. this one is a bit trickier to explain so i'll let the original comment speak for itself(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ktr6u/the_three_month_rule/djpaw4u/)

- think about the dollar per use ratio. so if it's something you won't use often, how expensive is it? is it worth it?

- take a picture of the item you want while shopping. at home look at the pictures and do the research. usually you realize you didn't really want it by then

i hoped i would get more that weren't for impulse buys, like i stated above... other personal finance life hacks, but i'm sure these rules of thumb can be used by others.

also, my mailbox is full, sorry i can't respond to all of you. i really tried :)

"by accidentally selling my boudoir photo shoot to a drunk pervert. edit #2: i can't handle all the requests to see the photos, so here(https://giphy.com/gifs/middle-finger-mister-rogers-fred-44eq3ab5lpyn6). they're not anything special. 

edit: jesus christ. 1) i admit i was dumb and fucked up, yo. hence this sub. 2) the officer said he wouldn't have gone if he had other things to do, so i didn't exactly waste his time. he said it was unsafe for a stranger to have the compromising photos of me so he understood why i wanted them back. 3) a boudoir shoot is actually a pretty common thing. it is not ""porn"" and i can't believe some of y'all are defending this creep. 

this happened a few months ago. sold our entire bedroom set because we were getting a new one to a nice man in his 60s. he picked up, paid, and all was well. 

a few hours later he messaged me on facebook asking if the pictures were of me. holy shit, i'd forgotten to clean everything out of the nightstand, which still contained a boudoir photo shoot i'd given my husband for our wedding. 

hella embarrassed, i explained what he'd found and that i would be willing to meet him to pick up the album. except now he starts being a creepy asshole and sending wink faces and saying he wants to keep it. the back and forth angry messaging was doing no good. he stopped responding after i threatened to get the cops involved. 

so i call the cops and they say there's not really anything they can do unless he starts actively harassing me; as i sold him the nightstand with the photos in it, they were technically his property. eventually an officer went to his house as a courtesy to me and asked if he'd be willing to return the pictures, which he did. the officer drove to my place and returned them, saying the man was quite drunk and upset that i'd sent the police over.

"for keeping a gift solely for my son rather than splitting it between him and my girlfriend's kids?. i've been with my girlfriend for four years now.  i have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her's.  my son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  her children are 12 and 14.  

pretty much since my son was born i've put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  when i first started i was never able to add much to it, but i worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what i could.  it now has over $40k in it.  i've been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  still i'm proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  i've daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  

my girlfriend knew about the account. there have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  she was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   now that my son will soon be graduating however we've come to a point where we are unable move past.   she doesn't want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. 

we are a great team usually.  it's almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  she's fighting dirty too, she's been making it out as if i don't really love her children. at least not as much as my son.  i do love her kids.  that's not in question, but the truth is of course i love my son more.  i feel like that shouldn't even be that controversial of a thought.  i truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she'd never admit it. 

i honestly don't even know if i would be able to split it up even if i chose too.  this is been something i broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  inside there's just a big ""no"" feeling that comes up when i try to consider it. 

i also feel like it's really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  in fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which i now help pay off) and i don't particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. 

neither of us have been backing down and it won't be too much longer until it's time to give him the money.  ",3

(previous accident the company of the truck that hit me paid for damages and a rental)  
now, to the price they are offering me because of the prior dent damage... $2,854 (tax included). is there anything i can do about this? i really needed at least $4,000.

edit: so i've gotten way more advice than i could have hoped for. a couple of things i have already done since posting.  
i've used both kbb and nada as well as looked at local postings of the same make, model, year of vehicles for sale. they are around and over $5,000 with well over 100k miles. so with the previous damage of a quoted ""$1,400"" i should still be getting close to $4,000 regardless.  
i have spoken to my insurance company and will make a claim with them if i do not get a reasonable offer from the city in response to my documentation and email. only reason i don't want to go initially through insurance is due to the fact that i will have to pay a deductible and risk my premium going up as some people have mentioned. also, i recently reduced coverage on the vehicle.   
.  
edit 2: also, for those stating to claim injury or speak to injury attorneys / lawyers. i was not in the vehicle at the time of the incident. garbage truck hit it, took off, then over an hour later came back down the other side of the street when the cop stopped him. he initially claimed to have not hit my car (grease and yellow paint all over my blue car) then claimed he didn't know he hit it even though the paint on his truck from my car seemed as if he tried scraping it off. usually garbage trucks do not take over 30min to come back down the other side of our street either...

edit 3: my state is texas. i will be looking into filing a loss of use claim for sure. i will also be making some more phone calls to my insurance company and going from there. i have read a lot of your comments with similar stories who have had great outcomes. hopefully i will report back with the same. thank you all again for the good (and bad) advice and the cold hard truths of the possible negative outcomes o_o thanks  
.  
edit 4: last update for today until i reach a milestone. for those saying i need to use my insurance company, i was told by my insurance company that they can't do anything since i recently changed my coverage to liability and personal injury. didn't include collision due to me selling the vehicle soon. just my shitty luck. so that's out of the question. on to fighting the city by myself with the help of reddit.",10

"update - i posted a bunch of creepy texts guys have sent me, onto facebook and instagram.. this is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9hqz2h/i_25f_posted_a_bunch_of_creepy_texts_guys_have/

 to recap my last submission, i posted an album of creepy texts i'd recieved from men in my field (computer engineering). some from classmates and a ta in college, some from people i met through internships and professional development activities, and some i know through my current job. i had been so fed up with the sense of shame and being silenced and not believed, about sexual harassment. and, for what it's worth, putting a large collection of harassing and threatening texts in the public eye, raw and unedited, made them difficult to ignore or explain away. after that post, i got a meeting invitation from my company's hr department, for this monday.

a lot happened over the weekend. i did a lot of research into employment law, i read through the whole company handbook again, and for each person i mentioned in my social media posts, i wrote out up a detailed account of their behavior towards me for my own reference, stuff that had not been said over text.

i also screenshot and backed up any angry or threatening texts towards me, that i received this weekend from the men whose old texts i'd posted online.

----

i think its worth giving some background on the four people included in my social media posts that i knew from my current job.

(coworker 1) a few months ago, i had reported him to hr for sexual harassment in the past, and he was moved off my team to another position in the company where he would not have any contact with me. he had signed a paper saying that he must not contact me for any reason, whether that is work related or not. i didn't sign anything during this process.

the messages from him that i posted on facebook were old texts from him, to my personal phone. making a comment about how i looked nice at work, and how i must have been dressing up for him. i'd replied that i was not. he asked me who i was dressing up for at work, if not him. because then he'd know who to be jealous of. i said 'myself' and told him to stop texting me on my personal phone. a few days later, he sent me a message telling me my new hair color was ""hot"" and asking me to drinks. that was a small snippet of creepy things he'd sent me, there was plenty more that i didn't post.

i found out today that he was the one who showed hr my posts, as i understand it, he had assumed i had signed a similar no-contact agreement that he'd had to. i had not ever made that agreement, in writing or vocally. i'd just not been talking to him because i had no desire to.

(coworker 2) he was married, and in the office, he didn't seem to do anything out of line. he had my number since i would be traveling for work and wanted my team members to be able to contact me. (we don't have work cell phones) 

out of the blue, he texted me asking me to join him at a fancy seafood restaurant when i returned from my work trip. it sounded like a date. i texted back ""uh you're married"" and he said some shit about how nobody would have to know, and how i seemed like a girl who could keep a secret. i told him to fuck off. 

he was fired a week later for unrelated reasons, so while i'd been thinking about going to hr, i never did. i haven't heard from him since, even after my social media post.

(coworker 3) he was also married. one time i was at a work happy hour and i left pretty early. he texted me on my work instant messaging platform, which i have on my phone, asking me to go party with him. i asked ""is your wife coming"" and didn't get a response. i didn't think it was bad enough to report to hr as sexual harassment, because something usually has to be done repeatedly to qualify as harassment, unless it is something egregious. (that was in the company handbook, in less concise words) 

that text exchange was included in my post.

after my post, he sent me a slew of threatening texts. apparently his wife had seen the post, and i had ""ruined his family"". he said that i was about to ""get what was coming 4 me real soon"", and to ""watch out"" which sounded like a threat. also called me a couple homophobic slurs. (i'm openly bisexual)

(coworker 4) he had just broken off an engagement. i didn't hear that from him, just through the rumor mill. he contacted me asking me if i wanted to go out, and i said that he wasn't really my type to date. he said that he wasn't looking for anything serious, just casual sex. i didn't reply for a few hours and then he sent me a second text saying ""well then go ahead and be a bitch and leave me on read""

since it happened outside of work, and was not any kind or repeated harassment, i also didn't think that it would be reasonable to bring it to hr unless i saw a pattern of similar behavior. he didn't contact me again, even after my post.

------

as for people from past jobs, internships, or classes...

my college contacted me about my old ta who had tried to hook up with me repeatedly, and stopped helping me with the course when it was clear he wasn't getting anywhere. they asked me if i'd give a statement. apparently he was still doing that shit, and someone else had reported him. and they saw from my post that i'd likely have something to report too.

a married guy who tried to get with me when i was an intern at another company sent me some really angry and threatening texts, i have to figure my instagram post (with his public instagram account tagged) caused problems in his marriage. i definitely have been taking extra steps to stay safe when i'm leaving my apartment or going anywhere. i'm considering reporting this to the police because it was the most overtly threatening thing i've received.

a few other people i tagged sent me texts telling me how shitty it was not to keep private conversations private, etc. i ignored all those.

-----

as for what happened this morning, in my hr meeting... i was all ready to go in with (metaphorical) guns blazing, defend everything i'd said or done with sources from the company handbook.

such as how i did not violate the company social media policy, as it only prohibited pretending to speak for the company as a whole if pr is not your job, or reveal confidential code or design or business contracts online. (i didn't mention my company in my post, or anywhere else on my social media)

i was also ready to defend how i followed the guidelines of what is considered sexual harassment and should be reported. how i reported repeated harassment, but didn't report isolated incidents that were not extreme. (the examples of extreme conduct included unwanted overtly sexual touching, or threats of violence. the handbook specifically mentioned that asking someone out once was not harassment)

but the meeting ended up being much more low-key than i had been expecting.

i'd taken down both posts sunday, as an act of good faith, though i doubted that would matter much.

when i went in, i sat down and asked if i could record the meeting. the hr representative (i'll call her beth here but that's not her real name of course) said ok. she wanted to talk about each of the specific people i'd posted screenshots from, who work at the company. (those made up less than a third of my screenshots fyi)

first was coworker 1. the guy i had previously reported to hr and who had been moved to a different team and told that he must not speak to me or contact me. beth said that he had brought the posts to her attention, as he was under the impression that the ""no contact"" agreement went both ways. i reminded her that i had not entered into a written or verbal agreement. i was surprised it was him who brought it up, but i didn't say anything. she asked if there had been continued harassment or contact from him after my initial report. i said no. she moved on to the next quickly.

coworker 2 had been fired a while back for unrelated reasons, but beth still asked if there had been any further conflict between us, while he was employed, other than the text messages. i said no.

she asked me the same question about coworker 3. i told her that i had received texts from him on saturday, that came across as threatening, and used several slurs about my sexuality. i gave her a printout of those messages. she read them, and immediately stepped out to show them to her manager. she came back after a few minutes to continue talking with me.

and again for coworker 4. i told her that he had not contacted me after he said i was a bitch for leaving him on read

beth asked me if i had any questions, and i basically asked what her next steps would be. she said that she would have asked me to remove the posts so that things could be handled with discretion, however i had already removed both prior to the meeting.  she also said that she would be meeting again with coworkers 1 and 4. she also said that due to coworker 3's threatening comments, he had been escorted out of the building while we had been speaking. fired. apparently he was already on record with them, for another issue relating to his temper, and this was the last straw.

she also asked me why i had not brought coworkers 2, 3, and 4 to her attention before. and i cited the section on harassment from the company handbook, saying that harassment was repeated unwanted comments or actions. and that a single event is not usually considered harassment unless it is extreme. the conversations with those three men had been isolated incidents.

she asked me if i would be more comfortable taking a personal day for the rest of the day, while she speaks to coworkers 1 and 4. she said she wanted to make it clear that i was not being dismissed or escorted out, i was not getting fired, it was only a precaution so that i would not be around coworkers 1 and 4, in case either of them wanted to confront me personally. i said i would.

so that's where i'm at right now.

she got all this on video - and she says i wasn't really attacking her. it was more like i was 'punching air'. i was glassy-eyed - and it was as if i didn't even see her or acknowledge her presence luckily, since i was sleeping my punches were very weak (so she says).

still, i am haunted by watching video of myself in a trance and haunted y losing 24 hours.

i feel terrible for punching and screaming at my wife.

she keeps trying to tell me it wasn't my fault, and she knows it wasn't me. that i was just sleepwalking.

i still feel terrible.

edit: i have checked myself into the hospital as of monday. thanks for your responses",12

"is extra muscle as hard on the heart as extra fat?. reading around i have seen suggestions that extra muscle can be as tough on the heart as carrying extra fat. this seems very unintuitive, i think of muscle as the good stuff and fat as bad (to an extent of course). but the logic is that muscle needs oxygen and nutrients and more of it strains the body. is this true or just a myth?",9
"by not remembering to breathe. *throwaway account, because i have no intention of memorializing this fuck up in my actual reddit history.*

this happened over the past weekend. 

so, there i am, masturbating in the shower. i was sharing a guest house with five other occupants. it wasn't a vacation. it was work accommodation. we were crew on an intense television series that was being filmed in various small town locations. lots of long days and late nights. the usual shit. 

it's 20:30pm. **fuck up time.**

it was the end of a long ass week. i had to purge. so, i smoked some weed with the crew/roomies, and then took a shower. i wasted no time getting down to nut busting business once i went nude. i didn't realize just how damn long it's been since i choked the chicken, until that first stroke. i damn near moaned. 

i up the speed. my hand is practically becoming a blur. i'm so deep in the moment, or you know, just too damn high to realize, that i'm actually holding my breath the entire time. my head's beginning to feel like it's spinning. i don't stop. i'm approaching the point of no return. it's close. i can feel it. just another stroke or two to unlock the jizz gates. at that moment, i pass the fuck out. 

i wake up within moments on the bathroom floor, bleeding. at the same time, the door swings open as two stoned colleagues of mine barge in to see if the crashing sound they heard wasn't all in their heads. for the record, it wasn't. when i collapsed, i fell, back first, through the fucking glass walls of the shower. 

thus, there i was, naked in front of the two dudes i work/live with, covered in minor cuts and a load of cum. 

what will no doubt scar us all forever was my damn dick remained rock hard and throbbing when i gained consciousness. which is how those motherfuckers found me on the floor. 

fuck you, life. **fuck. you.**

"tittyfucking is fraud, plain and simple. coffee and popcorn smell better than they taste. fine cheese tastes better than it smells. 

with that in mind, i feel like tittyfucking has a spot on the coveted go-to sex moves list that is wholly unearned and flat out fraudulent. it simply looks better than it feels, in an unforgivable way. tittyfucking is packaged and sold as a comparable experience, but it doesn't hold an erotic candle to a blowie or old fashioned hj. 

the mechanics are faulty at best. full disclosure, i prefer busty ladies. it's just who i am. even so, being properly tf'd without embarrassing and perhaps painful slippage has been a unicorn. my white whale. even girls with d cups don't seem to have the mass to properly and securely envelop the shaft for smooth, uninterrupted motions. that's not saying i'm hung, my penis is very average, i promise you. it just seems like women need watermelon sized flotation devices to achieve effect without an onslaught of mood-killing ebe's (early breast exits). 

you can imagine my frustration. on paper, tittyfucking should be a home run. it should be the vaccine for polio. in action, however, tittyfucking is like dr. sebi's aids cure. promised to work wonders but leaves you unsatisfied. 

i won't give up on tittyfucking, i will persevere and navigate these dark days. i just want to blow the lid off this conspiracy, and i finally have the courage to speak out and declare tittyfucking for what it really is. it's no better than communism. excellent in theory but never successful in practice.",6

"for keeping my marriage and child a secret from my mother, as well as refusing to let her see my son?. the secrecy started early. i am a gay woman. at 15 when i came out, my mom simply disagreed. she told me i wasn't gay. she said i was jealous. that these girls looked better than me and i was jealous of them, not attracted to them. she genuinely thinks it's impossible for me to be gay and never took it seriously. it got to a point where i didn't tell her if i met anyone.

skip to when i met my wife. when i'd finally let my mom know about her(we had been together two years now) the convo went like this:

me: we want to get married.
her, extremely disdainful: oh you do? well let me tell you something, throwawaygayallday, you're going to want a man. your car breaks down, you're screwed. you need heavy stuff moved? screwed. two women can't make love. you're going to want a man in bed with you.

i hung up on her, i was so fucking mad. i married my wife without telling my parents.

i never told my mom we wanted a child and never told her of his birth. when i visited for christmas, i went alone. i'm not sure when i planned to tell her or how. i just hadn't gotten around to doing it. serious procrastination and dread.

my wife and i live a few hours from my parents. they've never visited(they don't know my address) and when we spend time together, i go to them. they do pass through on the way to visit other family though. they had stopped at our wal-mart to get last-minute items and that's when they saw us.

i was there getting stuff for dinner and had my son in the cart seat. we were going down an aisle when i heard ""hey kiddo!"" from behind. i recognized my mom's voice and turned to face her, ready to do introductions. but damn man, the instant she saw my son, she gave him the dirtiest fucking look and said ""whose kid?""

me, now pissed: mine
her: what do you mean he's yours?
me: i mean he's mine
her: he can't be yours
me: ever heard of ivf?
her: so you went and spent god knows how much money to have a kid with your girlfriend
me: wife
her: and when were you going to tell me about all this?
me: i don't know, i don't want to talk about it in the middle of the store

i walked away and checked out, her following, still talking shit.

i put my son and food in the car and left. my mom called later. i tried to talk to her. i apologized for the secrecy, said she gets condescending when we talk about these things. she denied this. she then went on about how i didn't invite her to the wedding, that she'll never get that moment back and see me get married(which i do feel bad about).

she eventually asked when i would bring my son over. i said never. i said i wasn't going to bring him there when she's so negative toward us. i said she doesn't respect me or my family so she doesn't deserve to know my family. hung up on her and haven't answered her calls or texts. she has apologized for speaking to me the way she has but i don't care at this point. i'm too fucking mad. for not inviting her to the wedding and not allowing her to see my son? is ""never"" too harsh?",3

"chicago i was robbed by my airbnb host. looking for legal advice.. this all took place over the past weekend (friday/saturday, june 14-15) in chicago.  i already filed a police report, as well as brought this to the attention of airbnb both over the phone and on twitter.

unlike my posts about this incident elsewhere, i'll be as thorough in explaining the situation here as to get the most relevant advice possible.  i apologize in advance for the essay, but please read all of of it if you want to give advice, to make sure you get the whole story.

i was in chicago for the weekend for pokemon go fest - for those unfamiliar, it's an all-day paid event hosted at a park, this year it was at grant park.  my ticket date was for friday the 14th.

earlier that week (monday i think?) i went on airbnb to look for affordable options.  by this point, all the hotels in the area were close to $300 a night, and most airbnb's within a mile or two of grant park were either already booked or also that expensive.  i found what looked to be a good deal south of downtown for around $85 a night.  the host had mostly positive reviews, with the only negative review saying that he felt the price was too high for a single bed.  fine, nothing to really be concerned about there.  people said the host was nice, that he made them breakfast, really no reason to think there was anything fishy going on.

i requested thursday through sunday (checkout on sunday) through airbnb, and the host accepted my request later that day.  i put in the comments (where it says to tell the host about yourself, and they encourage you to share why you are traveling) that i was in town for pokemon go fest and would be gone most of the day, and just needed a place to sleep at night.  arrived in chicago, went to meet my host thursday evening.  the uber driver warned me that it wasn't the best place for an airbnb and that it was one of the unsafer neighborhoods in chicago.  well ok, nice to know, but i really didn't have any options at this point.

messaged the host that i was there, he came out to meet me and show me up to the room.  i took all of my belongings with me (i had a laptop worth about $2000, a suitcase with my nintendo switch among other things, phone chargers, clothes, medication), and said i would be back later, that i wanted to go get some dinner.  i asked him if there was a key for the place he could give me (as that's usually what airbnb hosts have done at past trips i've taken, even if it *is* just for a single room and not the entire place), and he said he doesn't have a spare key, but to just message him when i need to be let in and he'll come open the door.  again, he seemed friendly so i didn't think anything of it, and said i would be back later.

i got back, messaged him to let me in, and he came to open the door.  i went to bed, didn't talk to the guy at all.  he had the tv on all night, or at least until i fell asleep, i was lying in bed at 1:30am hearing his tv.

next morning (friday), i got up, showered, took my medication and left.  after all, that was the day of go fest, where i would be busy in the park from 9am-7pm.  the host knew this, i told him in my initial request to book that i would be gone all day.

so here i am in grant park at about 9:30, after just getting started with my day, when i got a message from airbnb support.  they told me ""your host is no longer able to accommodate you, let me know when i can call and discuss this with you.""   already pretty pissed off at this point as i was trying to enjoy my day, but i told them go ahead and call whenever.  i got a call from a ""resolution manager"" maybe 15 minutes after i sent that message, and the lady explained that, for whatever reason, the host was no longer able to host me and that, as compensation, they would give me a $200 voucher and give me links to other listings in the area.  great, i said, but what about all of my stuff?  i'm *busy all day*, i can't just go get my suitcase and laptop, having nowhere to take the stuff, nor can i check into some airbnb at 9:30 in the morning.  the lady said she'd check, and call me back.  she called back another 10-15 minutes later and said ""i talked to your host, he said he would be there all day so you can get your things when it's convenient."" i said great, then i won't leave the park and just go get my things after 7pm when the event is done.  i asked the lady if he gave a reason for cancelling my trip (at this time, i was too preoccupied to even ask *if he had a right to do this*, i just went along with it), and she said that he said something about ""not liking the communication"", whatever that means.  um, okay.

fast-forward to 12:30pm.  host messages me through airbnb (note that, the entire weekend i hadn't ever talked to the host outside of airbnb - i had his number and he had mine, but i didn't receive any text messages from him or any calls, and i didn't message/call him either.  given that the whole ""i don't have a key for you"" was already sketchy enough, i wanted all of my communications with him to be logged through airbnb so their staff could see it in case of incident.) saying ""your checkout time was noon and you didn't come to get your stuff.  i'm going to put it under the stairs."" i wrote back saying that airbnb support told me you would be home all day, what are you talking about? my checkout time was noon *on sunday*, not in the middle of the day on friday!  if he wanted to cut my trip short, that was on him, but he's not going to inconvenience me like this.  (okay, i didn't say all of that to him, just the first part about what support told me).  he wrote back saying ""i don't know what you two talked about but i definitely will not be home all day, i suggest you come get your stuff.""

well, considering that the front door to the building locks, i figured my stuff was safe under the stairs, only tenants of that building would be getting in anyway, and if he wasn't home later i could probably ask one of the other tenants to open the door for me.

so around 6pm when i had a bit of a break, i looked for another airbnb.  found something much closer that cost more money, since they were giving me a $200 voucher after all - tried to book one, but the voucher wasn't working.  i called them and they said they'd ""look into it"", and i basically said look, i'm running out of time, just give me $200 back to my credit card and i'll get a hotel, i'm done dealing with you guys.  they agreed, under the condition that i gave them the hotel receipt.  so i booked a hotel.

fast-forward to friday night around 8:30pm.  finished go fest, ate dinner, got an uber over to the place.  i actually told the uber driver i was going to get my stuff, and then need a ride to the hotel, he said he can just add a destination to our trip, and agreed to wait while i got my stuff.  the front door to the complex was locked, but the night before it had opened after i jiggled the knob a few times.  i'm standing there jiggling the knob and trying to push the door in when some lady gets out of her car with a young child.  she sees the uber driver parked there watching me, asks him what's going on, he explains to her that he's waiting on me, etc etc.  this lady's naturally a bit spooked, as she sees some strange guy trying to, what looks like, break into her apartment building while someone in a car is waiting for them.  definitely seems sketchy from her perspective.  i explain the situation to her and she's shocked that anyone would rent an airbnb in that building, but she agrees to open the door for me.  i get in, look under the stairs, and my luggage isn't there.  wanting answers immediately, i attempt to actually call my (former) host.  he doesn't answer.  she said she'd try to call since she lives across from him, i gave her the number - she calls, gets his voicemail, leaves a message.  oh, and meanwhile the uber driver alerted me that someone else was added to his queue so he has to leave.  i say thanks for the ride and that i'll book another when i'm ready.  now i'm by myself. 
 while we're waiting for a call back, i walk up to her apartment (which is directly across from his) - as she handed me a couple gallons of milk to carry for her while she unlocked the door for me.  i set the milk down in her apartment and, just for the heck of it, i open the tile app on my phone.

before i continue my story, let me explain real quickly what tile is and what it does.  tile is a small tracking device that you can attach to objects that you think you might misplace - in my case, my car keys and wallet.  i have one in my wallet and one on my key ring.  if your phone is within bluetooth range of these devices, you can make them play music to help you find the device - and if you ever lose it, the app will tell you where it's last seen.

so, anyway - much to my surprise, the tile app tells me *that my keyring is in range right now*!  literally, as i'm standing outside the guy's apartment that i can't get into, my car keys (which were in my luggage) are within a few hundred feet of my phone!  the guy calls her back and says ""look, i told the guest this too, i put his stuff under the stairs, if it's gone then someone probably stole it and it's his fault for not coming and getting it when i told him to."" she relays the message to me, but i say no... that's not true, the stuff is here *right now*, and i show her my phone.  she tells him this, and i hear loud yelling over the phone.  he starts cussing her out, saying it's none of her expletive business, and hangs up.  okay, now i'm starting to get the picture.  he probably saw this as a great opportunity - i said in my notes that i would be gone all day for an event, he sees that i have valuable items, what a great idea!  he can end my stay early, *know i can't get my stuff because i'm gone at an event*, claim he put it out for me and ""oh, it's gone, someone must have stolen it"".  meanwhile, he pockets all this valuable loot that he can do whatever with.  except... he wasn't planning on me being able to prove that my belongings were in his apartment that night when he wasn't home.  as soon as she tells him this, he flips out, realizing i'm onto him.  the lady calls the landlord.  landlord comes out, i explain this all to him.  he advises me to file a police report.  says that even though he has the key and *can* let me enter his apartment, he doesn't have the legal right to do so, and that the tenant (my airbnb host) could try to sue *him* for illegal entry.  the landlord also puts a notice on the guy's door, saying he's going to evict him, that it's totally against his lease to let guests stay there.  he was appalled that the place was even listed on airbnb.

we called the police, waited about half an hour for them to show up, making small talk in the meantime.  he told me he was gonna evict the guy soon anyway because of how shady he is, and that this whole airbnb thing suddenly makes sense, because the guy was always late paying the rent and kept coming up short, but that mysteriously a couple months ago he was able to pay it (after the landlord threatened to evict).  i keep telling the guy, look, that's all well and dandy but i just want my stuff back.  i do understand where he's coming from, and that's why i was glad to wait for the police.  if police can write up a warrant and let me in, great!  but after about half an hour of waiting, he said ""let's just go down to the station"" so he drives me there.

i run this by them, the cops basically say they can't issue a warrant off of that alone and that i have to attempt to get my stuff back directly from the person first, then i can file a report if he doesn't comply, *then* they can do something.  so the landlord tells me - the guy's usually home saturday mornings.  call him, call the police, they'll go up together and see what they can do.

so i'm staying completely empty handed at a hotel friday night, hoping i can resolve this matter in the morning.

saturday morning comes, i do exactly as instructed.  call landlord, call police.  police escorts come out, landlord comes out a bit later.  i call the host, who of course does not answer, so landlord gets his spare key and we start walking up to the place - me, landlord, and an officer.  knock on the door, no reply.  police knocks and says they're the cops, here with landlord and guest, the man opens the door ajar (leaving it chained so they couldn't force entry), starts filming and making this whole spiel about illegal entry and how they're infringing his rights.  he says to me ""i messaged you lots of times and you ignored me"", i say no you didn't, i don't have a single text from you and only the one message from airbnb and he says ""that's bulls*** and you know it"".  i say fine, show me your phone then where you sent me texts, and of course he refuses because that's not true at all.  the cop basically says look, at this point you tried, but you'll have to file a report for stolen belongings, we can't break into this guy's place.  meanwhile, i'm checking my phone while standing in front of his apartment like the night before, and the tile shows it's no longer there.  says it was last seen 10:30pm friday night (when we left to wait on the cops).

so, the guy moved my stuff elsewhere after realizing we were onto him, also took the notice off his door.  the landlord gave me all the information i needed to file my police report, and asked if he could see the airbnb listing just to see what i even agreed to with the guy.

would it shock anyone at this point when i learned that he used a fake name on airbnb?  the name i had for him wasn't even his real name.  huge surprise. /s

so anyway, i give the officer all this info, they write up a report.  i give them the itemized list of what was stolen, they estimate it at around $3000 (i actually forgot to tell them about my switch at this point), give me a ""victim notice"" and say an investigator will follow up with me in a week or so.  well, great, i won't even be there in a week, and he can easily sell my stuff before any of those serials i gave the cops get registered anywhere!

i called airbnb about this.  i said first of all, i didn't think hosts could just cancel a stay like that and kick a guest out.  they said ""they can't..."" and the guy on the phone said ""your stay wasn't cancelled at all, it shows a confirmed reservation from june 13-14 with you checking out on the 14th at noon."" i said no, that's not it, look at my original confirmation.  he checks and says ""oh, huh, i see that now."" digs into it and apparently some supervisor overrode something that should not have been overridden, as it shows in the airbnb app that i consented to the altered stay (i did not, and was simply *told*).  i don't know what lies he told the airbnb support people, but they somehow got their managers to override this and alter my trip to say i was checking out on the 14th instead of the 16th.

so at this point i'm considering my goods lost, and i called airbnb again and asked if there was any way they can take money from the guy (after all, if they deposit money into his bank account when people book stays with him, they can take it out too...) to reimburse me the $3000 he stole from me.  they said ""you can do that, but you have to fill out a request"" and they sent me a link.  the link only lets me request $87 back (one nights' stay, the other two were auto-refunded when the trip was altered).  i explain this to them, and they said ""just request the $87 back, the guy's not going to do it anyway, then after 72 hours you can escalate it to our claims division and they can go from there."" needless to say i'm less than pleased with airbnb's support by now, i've talked to several different ""case resolution managers"" who all just keep giving me links to things within the app, and none of them assuring me they will ban the guy from airbnb for being a fraud and stealing from his guests.

i sent the guy a message through airbnb saying, just fyi i gave the police all the serial numbers of what you stole, and i have gps tracking on my items should you try to sell them (the second part isn't entirely true, since tile requires a phone to be in-range of it to actually get the location.  since friday night it hasn't been picked up by any phones.  but he's not going to know that!) i said i'd be willing to drop the police report and airbnb claim i filed against him if he returns my stuff (again, not true, i'm absolutely still keeping that police report open) no reply of course, so i text him the same message.  still no reply.

sunday morning i figure what the heck, i'll try one last time.  i said something along the lines of ""if you don't return my belongings, i will sue you for at least $3000 which is the value of the items you stole from me.""  short and sweet.  he messaged back ""i filed a police report against you for phone harassment, don't contact me again""

i called the non-emergency police number and explained this all to them.  the lady said his supposed police report was complete bogus and that sending two messages asking for my stolen items back is absolutely not harassment, that it wouldn't hold up in court at all.  but either way, it's clear he's not going to return my stuff.

i'm now back in michigan without any of my belongings.  the guy's probably going to try to sell my stuff.  he's also probably being evicted from his apartment but that doesn't help me in the slightest.

airbnb is still ""working on the case and will contact you as soon as we can"", and i'm not expecting to hear anything from the police investigator for a week.

the lady at the police did say i can hire a lawyer in michigan to sue the man in chicago and not have to actually travel back to chicago myself.  though i'm not sure i'd trust that, i want to testify against the guy myself.

however, i've also never taken anyone to court before.  only times i've ever been to court were for jury duty and to contest traffic tickets.  hence why i'm asking for advice.  what can i really do at this point?  i've googled the subject and most people are saying airbnb just tells people to sue in incidents like this, they aren't a hotel and their insurance is to protect *hosts* from unruly *guests* and not vice-versa.  so i'm really not thinking they'll do anything either, and the guy's listings are still up as well.  half tempted to hire someone else to book the place and go looking for my stuff, lol.

but seriously, what should i do?  just sit and wait?  hire a lawyer? any advice is really appreciated.

a friend suggested i should sue for more than just what my stuff is worth, because of emotional trauma from the ordeal.  i believe the limit for small claims court is $5000, so i'm considering asking for the max.

tl;dr airbnb host who knew i would be gone and unable to come for my belongings bent rules and ended my stay early, kept all my items in his apartment and lied to me saying he left them out for me to collect.  tried to play it off as someone else stealing them, freaked when i confronted him on the lie and now refuses to cooperate with police nor give my stuff back.",2
"i faked a customer compliment to get myself a raise at work. i worked at a fast food restaurant for 7 years. i started working there at 14 and was part of the original staff when the store opened. i was really good at my job and worked well with the customers. nothing good i ever did was recognized, whether it was going above and beyond helping customers or constantly filling in for other staff when the store needed it, i felt under appreciated and my boss's were dicks. at this point i was 5 years in and not even a raise. i was one of two original staff still left. i saw an old couple come in and i made a plan. i went out of my way to give them the best service possible. even served them at their table like a sit down restaurant. after the very happy old couple left i went to our website where people would write complaints to head office. instead of a complaint i pretended to be the elderly man and gave myself a rave review to head office. i even noted the time they came in and saved a receipt to prove the validity of the comment. two days later i come into work and see my well worded compliment posted on the back board with some nice comments from head office and my boss gave me a raise. sometimes you gotta look out for yourself.

thanks everyone for the advice. i just paid off the loan this morning, it feels amazing. fairly certainly my mom would've wanted me to start down the path of being debt free. much love for you all.

"by causing about 40 people to fall down an escalator at the airport.. okay, it wasn't today but it was recent. that's all i can give you.

i was at a uk airport and as a perk of my job i had a business class ticket to fly to brazil. i'd never flown first class before and felt pretty giddy and excited, i mean, why wouldn't i?

i was going to brazil, for 3 weeks, busines class in a five star hotel i hadn't had to pay for. to make it even better as it was technically a business trip i was getting paid to be there.

i'm heading to the departure gate and i ended up on one of those long escalators, you know the kind they have in airports that you silently note to yourself ""hey, that's a big escalator.""

i'm going down, got my backpack on, my headphones in and i'm in a good mood, such a good mood i decide to jump the last few steps, just because i'm a little giddy thinking about all those brazilian girls, some sunshine, some cheap booze and absolutely no stuffy office and intolerable moody co-workers.

so i jump, hit the plate at the bottom and the fucking thing locks up and makes a high pitched noise. it doesn't gradually come to a stop, it just stops. 

it's a busy airport, it's a busy escalator too. i turn around and see people tumbling down this thing, crashing into people and more people falling. an alarm goes off and people in uniforms come running out shouting into walkie talkies.

i try my absolute best to disappear into the crowd, another shocked bistander wondering what's going on.

i see a lady bleeding from her nose, a man with a probably broken arm, kids crying and i know it's my fault. i feel horrible, but not just horrible, worried. worried i won't be going anywhere. what will work say?!

i head to the departure gate and bored my flight without issue, the business class is severely tainted. i spend the whole trip worried i'll be arrested at the other end, every possible scenario goes through my head.

i get off scot free but i'm still feeling bad about it so i thought i'd come and tell all of you about it, so you can judge me instead.

"for calling my fat friend fat after she called me a twig?. i am very self conscious about my weight. i am very skinny because of my fast metabolism and im very bony. it tears me apart when i hear people calling me a twig. i was eating lunch with some of my friends and the biggest one in the group said ""eat"" when i was throwing out half of my sandwich. i said ""im not hungry"" and she said ""you have to eat, your a twig"" they already know i have a fast metabolism because i told them before about it when they asked why i was so bony. i snapped back and said ""i'd rather be a twig then a whole tree"" and suddenly im the asshole. everyone in my group of friends hate me and i want to know if its my fault.

"by ripping my foreskin apart with a ceiling fan. mandatory not today but 20 years ago. 

i am 16 and horny. we didnt yet have the internet and this was still the days of searching nearby woods for scattered magazines held together by many long rains. it was also the days of waiting for your mom to go to the grocery store and using your free time to try to find literally anything new in the house to have sex with. this was one of those days. 

my mom left for the grocery store and i had an idea: duct tape a toilet paper roll filled with wet toilet paper to my penis. make sure it's really tight. then, create a rope from duct tape and wrap it around the blade of the ceiling fan. sit on one side of the ceiling fan and as the blades spin, it will pull and release the tube. brilliant. 

all starts well as i sit on a desk chair below the fan. a bit slow, but working so i turn it up. i start to notice that since there is no swivel, the duct tape is twisting and shortening. its pulling violently on my pubes and skin. i cant get the fucking thing off. fuck. i stand up to buy myself time. shut off the fan: pull the string and wait. oh fuck - still going. i'm on my tippy toes and my pubes are ripping. i pull the string and the fan begins to slow, but it's still twisting. i slam my hand into the fan to stop it. the fan breaks out of the ceiling, but i'm free.

as i unpackage my pleasure tube, i find i'd ripped a fist full of pubes out. my foreskin was twisted like an indian sunburn, checkered with blood and tears and the head of my penis is a ghostly grey.

it took 24 hours for the penis head to turn from mayonnaise to plum. my penis basically moulted over the next 3 weeks growing a new layer of penis over the old penis. i still have a long white scar down the shaft that has no feeling. 

good times. 

tl;dr: duct taped my penis to a ceiling fan and ripped my pubes and foreskin apart.

edit: changed some words.

edit: i want to be clear how this was supposed to work. i am sitting off center of the fan on a chair with my penis taped to the edge of one fan blade. the tape is slack. as the blade moves away, the take becomes taught and rips my dick right off. ",4
"by going down on my wife. one of my favorite things to do is go down on my wife. i have a talented tongue and i like to use it. last night i decided to make that experience even more mind-blowing for my wife by grabbing the dildo and fucking her with it at the same time. fun times were being had by all and things were getting very hot and very wet. then my wife started to orgasm and my hand slipped and the dildo shot out of her vagina and directly into my right eye. i pulled away and she asked what was wrong. not wanting to stop there i told her not to worry about it and i would tell her after. we finish and i go to the bathroom to rinse my face (and eye) and tell her what happened. we both are laughing hard at this but i tell her jokingly ""your vagina just gave me pink eye!""

well, today my eye was red, itchy, burning, and gross. i just left urgent care with drops for pink eye. my doctor thought it was hilarious and burned my ass on the way out saying ""now go to the pharmacy for your vagina drops!""

i always thought my first lesbian sex injury would be a broken finger.

"warren buffett just revealed the best investment most people can make. ""buffett's logic is that someone who invests in a s&p 500 index fund, by definition, will match the market's performance.

on the other hand, ""active investors"" as a group will also deliver average investment performance over time -- that is, some managers' investments will do well, and others won't. however, when you add in the cost of actively managed investment options, particularly hedge funds, the result is that the average hedge fund will underperform the market.

from the results of his bet, which competed against five funds-of-funds that represented hundreds of individual hedge funds, it appears his logic was sound. in fact, buffett estimates that 60% of all the fund-of-funds gains went toward management fees.

buffett's main point is that when managers charge high fees, the managers may earn tremendous profits -- but investors won't. therefore, the best investment most people can make, whether they're wealthy or just have a few hundred dollars to invest, is a low-cost index fund such as the one buffett used for his bet.""

"me 23 m with ex 23 f, we were high school sweethearts. she left me to ""have fun"" in college. now is out of school, back home and is pissed & has everyone else pissed at me because i wont take her back. sorry that title was super wordy.  but it kind of explains most of the problem here.  we had been together since we were juniors in high school.  we were each others first everything and i thought that we were going to be together forever.  but she went away to college and midway through her freshman year she comes home and tells me before she leaves that while she loves me with all of her heart and i am the one she wants to be with forever and marry that while she is in college she does not want to be tied down and needed to be able to have her fun.  she was telling me this as though she were explaining the directions to hooking up a computer.  in other words no emotion, just simply statements of facts and my thoughts and feelings on the situation did not matter.  she even went on to tell me that she wanted to make sure i knew she would always practice ""safe sex"" for our future together.
  
well my reaction i guess was not what she planned.  needless to say i'm not very proud of how i reacted at the time but i became very emotional with her.  i begged her not to do this and that under no circumstance would i ever consider this okay.  she basically said i was being immature and that once a couple of weeks passed i would be able to talk to her rationally.  oh and as a bonus she wanted to get my assurance that i would practice safe sex as well for when we got back together.

the two weeks went by and she called me and acted like no big deal.  but as we started to end the call she wanted to make sure that i was ""better"" about her sleeping with other guys.  i use the present tense because as she then informed me in that two weeks she had already slept with two other guys.  again not proud of this now but i broke down when she told me this.  she said she did not want to hurt me so she wouldn't be telling me anymore about what she does.  i told her that i had no desire to talk with her anymore period.  that i was willing to work on things before she slept with other people but that was the end of it for me and i told her i was done.  she said once again that i was being immature and that she would just wait on me to contact her when i was grown up enough to understand that there is a difference between sex and love.  that was the last time i spoke to her until about 1 month ago when she moved back home and showed up at my house one night acting like we had been together and not apart for three years.  she did not expect nor appreciate my reaction to her showing up.

i opened the door and there she was with a big smile on her face.  she immediately asked to come in and i said i would come outside which obviously caught her off guard.  i asked what she wanted and she said and i quote ""well that's a hell of a way to greet someone you love"".  to which i told her that she was delusional and that whatever love i had for her died the day she told me she had already started having sex with other men.  she honestly had a very confused look on her face and then said and i quote again ""are you still uptight about all of that"" and then said ""i would have thought by now you would have grow up about that"".  

i told her that not only was i not over it, that i would never be over it other than to be over us.  at which time she proceeds to say to me ""you mean to tell me you are throwing away everything that we are together because of some stupid physical issue"".  ""i know we love each other and are meant to be together so how do we fix this"".  

i was just dumbstruck.  how in the fuck can one person be this stupid.  i asked her what i was throwing away.  we have not spoken in almost 3 years other than via text and even then it was her texting me and not me replying.  

she left very disappointed and that should have been the end of it.  but here is the kick in the ass.  i have now been inundated by friends, her family and hell even some of my family wanting to know why i was throwing away someone so special.  

i ended up telling my family members the truth and after they heard about it they quickly recanted and told me to tell her to fuck off.  but to her family i just said she dumped me years ago and we hadn't been together for almost 3 years.  this came as a shock to them as she had been telling them all along that we were still a couple and even when she was home on breaks would tell them we planned on marrying.  at first they didn't believe me that we hadn't seen each other in years and i'm still not sure they do.

but the friends are the ones that piss me off the most.  they know the truth and yet they think i am being ""weird"" about all of this.  they said when you are young you are supposed to play the field but if you love someone you know that in the end you will be together.  i don't have enough time to write out all of the words i said to them but i can assure you it was laced with lots of curse words.  i am now down a few friends but imo they weren't friends really anyway.

here is why i'm here.  i feel good and confident about my decision.  however because i have had so many people question me i am here to ask anonymous strangers this.

am i wrong?  should i have just accepted that she was going to play around and now that she is older she wants to settle down and start a family?  am i just so out of touch that i don't i want to be with a person who would want to do that and then spend the rest of my life with them?

also just for info here, there is nobody else.  it's not like i'm saying no because there is another girl, which she is accusing me of to our friends btw.

edit:  wow i posted this and then went out for the evening not knowing if anyone would even respond.  i get up this morning and this thing has blown up.  there are lots of great comments and i want to thank almost everybody for making me not feel crazy.  there were some legitimate questions that were asked as well and i think i'll just answer them here instead of trying to chase down every post.

why did i not slam the door in her face?  that really is a legitimate question, one of which i do not have a good answer to.  all i can say is that i was caught completely off guard, i had not seen her in years and i had no idea she was even back home.  so i opened the door not knowing who it was and when i saw her i froze.  i thank god i have a screen door as well because i have a feeling had there not been a barrier between us she would have tried to hug me.

question 2 how the hell did she make her family think we were still together for three years even though we were never together, i never went to their house and there are no facebook photo's of us during that time?  well the answer to this is simple.  i have no idea.  from what i can tell she had them convinced, because i guess she also had herself convinced, that we both agreed to the ""open"" relationship during college but would be back together permanently when she got home.  personally i think the entire thing is fucking stupid because let's pretend for one minute that i would actually agree to this bullshit (never would in a million years) why the hell would we avoid each other for the three years whenever she was home on break.  so to be blunt either they are dumber than i thought or she has manipulated them to the point of not even questioning simple issues.

now the one thing i guess i did not mention in my original post is that her cousin, who actually is sane and has been level headed about all of this, did tell me that she had a complete and total meltdown after i booted her off of the porch.  she said that she cried for three straight days.  i just don't get it.  how in the name of god could she be this upset?  i mean she hasn't seen or spoken to me in three years, how could she even care?  i mean that, how do you even care about someone after three fucking years?",7
"today, i made the conscious decision to crap my pants.. light

two weeks ago i gave birth to a beautiful, premature baby girl. she spent some time in the nicu but is since home and doing very well. i however, suffered a pulmonary embolism and severe preeclampsia after her birth, not to mention that while i was heavily pregnant i was admitted to the hospital for a few weeks to be completely tube fed due to malnutrition from my hyperemesis. so, it's safe to say that now that i'm back to eating again, my guts don't really know what to do with themselves. 

two days after bringing the baby home, i was sitting in the rocker and trying desperately to get her to nurse while i was home alone with her for the first time. after so much frustration and many tears from both of us she finally latched and was going strong. after only a minute or two i felt that very telltale rumble in my guts. i knew shit was about to go down(so to speak) and that i only had moments to make it to the bathroom. i looked down at my sweet baby girl, who needed to put on weight to stay healthy and who had so much trouble in the beginning and thought to myself ""she'll never latch back on if i take it from her now and upset her""

and thus, i made the conscious decision to shit my pants. it simply had to be done. i sat there and fed my baby while i soiled myself. i'm so glad i was home alone. i sat there in my messed pants for half an hour while i finished feeding the baby. i then put her down for a nap and cleaned myself up. i will never tell a soul that i know irl this story, but i knew it was too funny to never see the light of day at all. so here we are.

"for asking my friends if their daughter has blue eyes?. one of my cousins, peter just had a baby with his girlfriend a few days ago. peter and all his siblings all have very stunning blue eyes which they inherited from their mom. they always get compliments on their eyes. peter and his girlfriend posted a picture on social media of their baby girl today saying she was born on the 23rd and i decided to give peter a call to congratulate him. when i called he was with his girlfriend and the phone was on speaker. i congratulated both of them and said their baby was gorgeous and that they'll be great parents. i then asked peter ""did she get your blue eyes?"" (in the picture they posted on social media the eye color wasn't visible) peter and his girlfriend's tone completely changed and his girlfriend said ""jesus, why are you so concerned by the eye color of my baby. it's fucking weird"" i was pretty taken aback by her reaction. i didn't mean anything by it i was just curious. i thought this was a normal conversation point. i tried to say i didn't mean to offend her and apologize but she kinda cut me off and said they were really busy and they had to go.

i told my mom what happened and she said that peter's girlfriend is a new mom and is probably just emotional and thought i was insulting her baby but that i didn't say anything wrong. however my sister said i was out of line and that the fascination people have with blue eyes is weird and there were racial implications since peter's girlfriend is biracial (half jamaican). this didn't make sense to me. i never said not having blue eyes was bad. my eyes are brown! i was just curious!

here?

edit: yeah ok peter called our family to thank my mom for a gift and we talked a bit. i apologized again for offending them. he accepted my apology but said his girlfriend is was really mad at me but she'll probably calm down in a day or 2. he explained that they've been harassed by family members from even before the baby was born about whether the baby would have blue eyes and his girlfriend is very annoyed by people's fixation on eye color and feels there's some racist undertone to it since blue eyes are ""white features"" and that people think her baby would be any less beautiful if it didn't have blue eyes. apparently his mom said during her pregnancy ""too bad she probably won't have blue eyes"" and his girlfriend started crying and refused to talk to her for weeks. i feel really bad now.

"ca i smashed a drone in my yard this morning. what can happen to me?. obligatory on mobile, etc. 

this morning, as per usual, i got up at 5, got ready, and left at around 5:15. ten minutes later, my wife calls me saying there's a drone hovering in our backyard and it's making her feel unsafe and violated, as if she's being watched. we have two dogs, but otherwise she was home alone early in the morning and scared. 

i drove back home and found it hovering about a foot off the ground in the middle of my yard, with a camera attached and i assume on. i walked outside with a baseball bat and tried to gesture to the camera for it to leave, and even brandished the bat a couple of times. after it still hasn't moved, i hit it with the bat, which broke the blades off a couple of motors and knocked the battery off. 

i brought it inside and left for work, and my wife was very grateful and felt much better after i left. 

i personally felt that the only reason someone would be flying a drone that close to the ground at that time of morning was to either harass my dogs, or to scope out my home for burglary, so i felt i made a safe and conscious decision to protect my family and pups. 

but now i'm curious about the liability and my research tells me there's a lot of debate about whether it's legal for someone to be on your property that low with a uav or whether i legally had the right to destroy it. 

can i be held liable for the damage? if the owners come to my door can i just give them the drone back and tell them to keep it off my property, or will be be expected to pay for the cost of a replacement? do i have any defense for protecting my home and dogs from invasive cameras and a nuisance danger for my dogs? 

in southern california, by the way.

edit: thank you guys so much for the reassurances, i promise i have read every comment. obviously, given that it was very early in the morning and i was already running late for work, coupled with the fact that my wife was deeply uncomfortable and felt unsafe, i reacted more emotionally than i probably should have. 

now that i know it was likely an accidental situation caused by a lost connection, when i get home i'm probably going to look into the device and see if i can determine its make, model, and potentially who owns it. i feel pretty guilty that i destroyed what was likely a fairly expensive piece of equipment, but i do stand by my decision to act in favor of my family's safety. i'm debating reaching out to the owner if i can find them to return the broken pieces but haven't decided if it's worth the risk of being sued especially considering the vague laws regarding shooting down an aircraft. thank you for all of your advice and i hope either way the pilot takes more care in ensuring their equipment stays in their line of sight and off private property.",2

"is it possible to 'store' light so it can be used as a form of energy?. year 12 student here. i recently learnt about superconductors and how they can essentially keep current running in a loop forever without losing energy. random idea just popped into my mind - since we've developed fibre optics - a way of transmitting data by sending light patterns with energy loss close to 0 - why can't we use principles such as tir (total internal reflection) to collect large amounts of light (sunlight) and then store it similar to how the superconductor bank works? 

if we could be able to store light as a form of energy - could be collected, amplified by using mirrors and be a source of sustainable energy much alike solar panels (quite inefficient).

"for being livid at my roommate for calling me an ambulance?. so thursday, i went to a party one of my friends threw. it was your pretty standard college party and i got pretty drunk yada yada. when i went back to my house, i was stumbling around trying to get to my room. one of my housemates helped me to my room and told me to sleep it off which i planned to do. 


i don't remember too much since i blacked out but this is what some of my housemates told me. my roommate was in the room when i came in and he said i kept falling off the bed and talking to myself. he ended up calling an ambulance for me and apparently the emts forced me to go to the hospital and threatened to call the police if i didn't go so i didn't have a choice. 

when i woke up in the hospital the next morning, the nurse gave me papers to sign and then let me leave. they also stuck me with a $1000 hospital bill for the ambulance. since i was basically dragged to the hospital, i left my keys and phone inside so i couldn't get in. none of my housemates were home so i ended up just waiting outside of the house for like an hour before one of them finally came back. on top of that, i missed my cad class which is a whole different story. 

i was absolutely pissed with my roommate for calling me an ambulance. not only did i end up spending the night at some hospital, i got a $1000 bill on top of it too. it's one thing if i had alcohol poisoning or something like that but i literally just slept at the hospital and left the next morning. the housemate who helped me inside was on my side, he said i was hammered but it wasn't that bad and i could just sleep it off. the roommate said he got scared and didn't know they would take me to the hospital but that just made me even more mad since there was like 5 other people in the house at the time and his first reaction was to call the police rather than ask the others. so aita?

edit: i'm not mad at my roommate for calling the ambulance. if i looked that ducked up, i would probably do the same. i'm upset about the fact that calling the cops was his first instinct rather than ask the other roommates. i mentioned my other housemate said i was super drunk but i could sleep it off and my roommate instantly decided to call the cops. i didn't get any tests at the hospital, i literally just slept there for the night and left when i woke up. some of the comments are correct in that the american healthcare system is unfortunately part of the issue here. i was willing to endanger myself rather than pay a $1000 bill i can't afford. if that makes me ta, then so be it.",3

a bit of background: alex is a vegan - and i mean that as literally as i can. he is a philosophy student and loves debating. i think he also has a bit of a superiority complex. alex talks constantly about the immorality of eating meat. he brings it up daily. he has posters of animated cows looking sadly at steaks hung in his bedroom. he has said, and i am directly quoting, that ""eating meat is the same thing as defending slavery because you don't think the lives of black people have meaning."" he has said ""eating meat is the equivalent of joining and supporting isis."" 

he is not joking. 

he calls anyone who eats meat ""carnist pigs"". he says this to their face while they eat. he believes it is his life's mission to educate people out of eating meat and awaken them to veganism. if we are in line together in a restaurant and someone else is ordering, he'll judge and mock them (out loud) for ordering anything meat or dairy related. he'll constantly say ""hey, check this out!"" and show you whatever vegan food he is eating, going into detail about the ingredients and where they come from. by constantly, i mean nearly every time he eats a meal, he does this. he'll come into your room to show you his plate. 

now, i don't disagree with him morally. we've had dozens of debates on the subject philosophically and i concede on many of his points. there's no doubt that eating meat is a morally fraut issue. where i take issue is that he deliberately tries to make people feel guilty for their dietary choices. i have started eating out, or at other people's houses. i've been packing my lunches in secret because i just don't want to deal with him. 

if anyone tells alex to piss off, he responds with ""cool, have fun murdering!"" or ""enjoy your death sandwich!"" 

so flash forward to today. we're in line at a burrito restaurant. i'm ordering my usual thing, and he makes a comment about how i could fill my tortilla with veggies rather than support systemic murder. similar to the crap he always says. 

i look him dead in the eye and tell him, ""man, if you don't stop doing this shit when we eat, i'm not going to eat with you anymore. the way you behave is inappropriate and hostile and frankly, i'm not interested in being friends with someone who makes it their mission to humiliate people like this."" 

he laughed and told me to chill. i said i was dead serious. he hasn't spoken to me since. not sure the best thing to do here since our lease doesn't expire until may. i'd love to be able to eat a pepperoni pizza in my home without being called a terrorist.

so, aita? how should i go about navigating this? 

edit #1: obligatory wow, this blew up comment! thank you for chiming in. for those of you saying this is pretty one-aided - like, yeah. i was mainly seeking advice on how to handle it going forward, and writing it down helps you clarify how crazy shit is when it happens. and i got a lot of helpful tips so thanks! 

for those asking why we are friends: he can be a great guy. we get along and agree on about 95% of other subjects. we have a history together now. i was used to him making jabs, but didn't know he was this insufferable until we lived together. 

for those saying this is fake - man, i wish. i constantly tell him not to behave like a meme of himself. so i get why it might read that way, but he's legit.",3
"for refusing to share my 4 seat table with 2 complete strangers at a restaurant?. so i was recently having lunch with a friend and we had decided to try a restaurant that neither of us had been to.  we had reserved a table but when we arrived, the waitress took us to a 4 person table. i told her that we only had made a reservation for 2 people, she said that this was the only table that they had available for us. 

the table was a small rectangular table, with 2 chairs on each of the longer sides, with one of the shorter sides against a wall. we sat facing one another, leaving an empty chair next to us on either side. 

anyway, about half way into our meal, the waitress comes up to us with 2 other people behind her and asks us if we wouldn't mind sharing our table with these 2 other people. 

at first i was a bit taken aback, and really felt obliged to say 'yes' because she was standing there with these 2 other customers. but my thinking was that we had made a reservation, we hadn't been told that this table would require us to share, we were already into our meals and no effort was made to discreetly inform us of this request or explain the situation. so i said (as politely as possible) that we were in the middle of our meal and would prefer not to share the table. i know this was taking a stand, but my view was that she had made no effort to be fair to us in this situation so why should i bend over backwards and ruin our meal by sharing a small 4 person table with 2 other strangers.

the waitress looked at me as if i had been incredibly rude and then proceeded to apologise to the other 2 people right in front of me saying something like: 'i'm so sorry but unfortunately they are unwilling to share their table we will have to find another place for you. i'm so sorry for the inconvenience'  (this was despite the fact that they had clearly heard me and were a little uncomfortable with the situation themselves). 

after this whole debacle, we were treated quite poorly by the waitress (she didn't top up the water, took a long time getting the cheque etc).

afterwards my friend told me that i should have just agreed to share the table and shouldn't have been so un-accommodating. but the way i see it, we should not have been put in this position by the waitress. if they had a policy of sharing tables (regardless of whether or not someone has made a reservation), then we should have been warned before we sat down.

am i the asshole for pushing back on the waitress' request and refusing to share our table?

tldr
we had a reservation for 2 people at a restaurant, but were sat at a small 4 person table when we arrived. half way through our meal, a waitress interrupted our meal (with 2 other customers)  and asked us if we could share our table - without any explanation as to why we were being asked. i politely said that we were half way through our meal and would prefer not to share. this was not taken well by the waitress and we were treated rather coldly after this encounter.

"seriously guys, invest in a dash cam for your vehicle. in my opinion, everyone should have a dash cam. it can potentially save you thousands of dollars if you get into an accident. it doesn't matter if you're a good driver, because guess what? other people aren't. and you're driving within inches and feet of those people every day, especially in the city.

one of my friends just got into an accident when another car ran a stop sign (along with speeding) and t-boned her on a country road. guess what? the guy is pointing the finger at her and there were no other people around so no witness'. i have never been in that situation before so i don't know what's going to happen, i'm assuming she'll be going to court over this. if she had a dash cam, it would be an easy win for her.

you can find a cheap dash cam on amazon for sub $100. the really nice ones are around $300 or so, still pretty cheap for what it does. the one i have is around $150, hd recording, starts automatically when the car turns on. records in a 90 minute loop.

so if you don't have a dash cam in your vehicle, i highly recommend you invest in one asap.

/r/dashcam

**edit:** man, this blew up overnight. i'll try and go through my inbox and respond. been getting a lot of questions on how dash cams work and how to ""wire"" them. there is no ""wiring"" needed, you don't need to be a mechanic to do this. i know absolutely nothing about cars. **all you do is take it out of the box, attach the camera to the mount that comes with it. put the mount (suction cup) to your wind shield. plug it into the lighter charger and you're done. it's really that simple. when you turn on the car it will start recording automatically. you don't need to touch it. it records on a 90 minute loop and stores 18 five minute videos on a sd card that comes with it. what if it gets stolen? well, i live in a safe area so i never have to worry about that. if i lived in the city i would definitely take it off and store it in the glove box or out of sight somewhere**

the dash cam that i have is the **kd links x1**. so everything that i said is specific to that camera. i'd post the link here but people would probably get upset and accuse me of trying to make money. so just go to amazon and look it up. it's a great camera and awesome customer service.",10

"i say my parents and boyfriend down to have a long and much needed talk.. my last post talks about how my dad and mom bully my boyfriend. i've been keeping my boyfriend away because of it. 

okay here's what happened. mom made a huge dinner wednesday night and said she wished she had more people to enjoy it. i took the opportunity to get this over with. i called up my boyfriend and told him to come over. boyfriend showed up, we sat at the table to eat. here's the conversation that followed. 

dad: ""well look who decided to finally show.""

me: ""dad, i'm tired of this.""

dad: ""tired of what, i'm just kidding, gosh!""

boyfriend cut in and shut it all down. it was amazing. i thought i was going to do most of the talking but here boyfriend does this wonderful thing. my parents faces were a mix of shock and sadness. 

boyfriend: ""no it's not joking. it's not just kidding around. it hurts when you single me out. it hurts when you both laugh at me. why? what could i have possibly done to deserve this? i've treated you all, including your daughter, with respect and this is the thanks i get. i've been staying away because i always get talked down to. yes i'm a landscaper, yes i have anxiety, yes i'm human and i don't need you both to act like i'm not.""

"for setting a timer next to me when i was being served at applebee's?. i went to applebee's with a friend and noticed a promotion on the menu where you get your food free if it doesn't come out in 10 minutes or less. i thought that this was a bold claim and decided to put it to the test. after the waitress took our order, i put a timer on my phone and put it in front of me on the table. it felt weird to do it, but i wanted to have some sort of proof so that they didn't think i was trying to scam them. sure enough, 18 minutes passed before we got our food. i showed the waitress my timer and she apologized and said that she'd waive the bill. after we finished, i made sure to tip double of what it would've been without the promotion. aita? and how would you deal with a promotion like this?

"i just paid off my first student loan!. i graduated this past may, and have a history of struggling with money (i was disowned while in college). today, i paid off one of my student loans in full (around $7500)! i don't want to bring it up to my friends (a lot of them are still in school or living at home post grad), but i'm really happy and excited! it's been a lot of budgeting and stress, but i feel like i'm in a really good spot going forward.

edit: wow this blew up way more than i thought. thank you all for the kind words and wishes! still a long road to go ($~65,000 after this loan i believe), but i'm hoping that i can make as much progress as possible and pay it off in under 5 years.

"after 18 months, my wife and i paid off $93k in student loans and are now debt free. time to save for a house!. i don't really have any particularly interesting methods to share, just the tried and true stuff you've seen on here a million times. i will share none the less, because it never hurts to hear good advice more than once! also, i think getting everyone's unique perspective on the situation can be interesting. and who doesn't like a feel good story? right?

so to start with, some background about us. i'm 30, she's 27, and we've been together for over 12 years, married for 3. we started dating in high school! so i guess based on that fun fact alone we're already beating the odds. all of the student loans were hers. when i went to college i was in a bad place in my life, struggling with depression, living with an alcoholic father after an insanely long and bitter divorce of my parents, and generally feeling unmotivated to do anything. so... i didn't, and my grades in college were proof of that. i was put on academic probation after my first semester. my grades didn't improve in my second semester, and i was asked to take a semester off. i just never went back. this was probably the lowest point of my life. 

luckily for me, the only thing i was ever truly passionate about was computers, and i had taken up programming as a hobby in my spare time which would ultimately become my career. i guess when you're depressed it's easy to hide in the basement playing on the computer all day every day. shortly after dropping out of college a very lucky series of events occurred. one of my dad's good friends who just happened to be in charge of hiring software developers for a small business gave me an opportunity to come in and interview for a full-time software developer position. so in i went, barely 20 years old, with my only experience being working for a grocery store, fresh from dropping out of college. the interview was a bit awkward to say the least. but... just kidding. no but. they didn't hire me. i was told they hired some hot-shot self-starter with tons of experience instead who was going to hit the ground running and that sounded more appealing than training me as the greenest programmer in the world i suppose. needless to say i was pretty bummed about this, but (here's the *real* but) if memory serves me, i believe it was no more than about 6 weeks later that i got a call back from the company. they told me that the other guy wasn't working out, he was a bad fit culturally and wound up not being as much of a self-starter as advertised. point is, he was out, and i was given the opportunity -- literally -- of a lifetime.

i think i received that call on a friday, and started the next monday... at $12 per hour. oh yeah, you read that right. this isn't one of those ""i'm a software engineer making $180k straight out of college"" stories. i grinded this career out to get to where i am now 10 years later, and i'm not exactly the highest paid software engineer even today. i developed a work ethic almost immediately and made a point to always be the nicest guy in the office having heard all the things everybody said about the previous hire. doing the work was easy since i was naturally interested in programming and had been doing it for fun. that company treated me extremely well. i worked there for 9 years, and only quit about a year ago. when i quit i was making $19/hr, but was making *substantial* profit sharing bonus every year in the range of $20k+. leaving was one of the hardest decisions of my life because they treated me so well personally and the office culture was so great, but the finances just didn't work out. i had more than earned a fair market value with my years of service, and $19/hr wasn't cutting it, even with the massive profit sharing bonuses. those bonuses were actually one of the primary motivations for me to leave, because having a bonus sounds nice, but when your bonus comes on a monthly basis and represents ~35% of your take-home pay, it stops feeling like a bonus and starts feeling like a necessity. when the company finally stopped growing and i saw my pay checks dwindle, i knew it was time to go searching for a more fair market value, and i found one. so now i have a stable salary of $72k instead of an incredibly volatile salary of anywhere from $40k-$65k depending on the year, and i feel like i have plenty of room to grow. i should mention i live in nebraska, so money goes a long way here. $72k is above the curve in general.

my wife's story is basically the polar opposite of mine, so this is going to be short. she has a loving family that are all the nicest most supportive people ever, and she is an absolutely phenomenal student who was always a hard worker with perfect grades. she earned her undergraduate degree in psychology, and attended graduate school where she earned an educational specialist degree, which apparently is slightly more school than a masters degree, but not as much as a phd. she just started her career 2 years ago working as a school psychologist for the local school district here earning about $48k. she worked through school before that doing various jobs like waiting tables and fast food. so until she started her career job, we basically lived on my income.

so the finances as of today are that we have a combined income (gross) of $120k, and we live in the midwest where it's cheap to live. so it hasn't exactly been difficult to destroy this pile of student loans as quickly as we did.

one big aspect that helped us tremendously is that we've always been a team. i've always earned significantly more than she did, meanwhile all $93k of those student loans were in her name, but this has never for a second been a point of contention for us. we've always been on the same team, and we both are very naturally frugal. 

we of course set a budget, and stuck to it. we cook all our own meals and rarely eat out. we cut the cable 6+ years ago and have been paying only for internet. both of us have reasonable cars that we paid cash for with no car payments. we both have cheap hobbies, and are in general just allergic to spending money. we joke about how silly it is for us to ""go shopping"" because usually what happens is we'll be bored on a weekend and head to the store knowing that we want to buy something. then we'll get to the store and scoff at the price tags, and resolve to go home and buy it on amazon instead. then we'll sleep on it, and never buy it. 

oh yeah, and not having kids of course has helped. probably should have mentioned that earlier.

i've been contributing to a retirement account since i started my career at age 20 and my wife did the same just a few years ago. i'm almost to 6 figures in my retirement!

when she graduated there was immense pressure from friends and family to just rush into buying a house. this was before i got my new job with a more stable salary, but we made the choice to eliminate all the debt first, especially with all the uncertainty with my job.

we've paid navient apparently ~$5k per month for 18 months. it hurt. but it's done. here is my favorite screenshot ever(http://i.imgur.com/wyeqke4.png)

it feels great to be debt free! now we're hoping to put that same saving power towards a down payment on a house when our lease is up in ~10 months. and with our new found purchasing power thanks to not having debt, we'll be able to afford any house we could possibly imagine. but of course, we're still going to pick something that's well below our means. here in nebraska the most extravagant house i could possibly imagine living in would be in the ~$350k range, so we're shooting for no more than $250k instead.

if you have any other questions, ask away. i'm sure i skipped something.

chet is really close with my girlfriend. when i go to sleep (i go to bed really early), she goes and hangs out in his room. when i ask her about it, she tells me what good friends they are, and goes into detail about how she just could never even imagine his lips touching hers, that it makes her sick to think about. part of me believes me, but part of me wonders why she goes into such detail about how repulsed she is by this idea.

recently, they got into a fight because his girlfriend doesn't like my girlfriend. this fight ended in him buying her her favorite snacks and leaving them on our bed.

this seems like way intimate to be just a friendship to me, but i'm afraid to flat out ask her if they're sleeping together. i don't want to ruin our relationship over them just having a nice friendship. i don't know what to do.

update: thanks for all the comments and encouragement. no, i did not set up a spy cam or try to walk in on them. 

i chickened out i think because i deep down didn't want to catch them in the act. turns out i didn't need to.

i stayed quiet about it, which wasn't too hard because i was really busy with school this week anyway. last night, my girlfriend told me we should throw a party at our apartment. i didn't really want to, but figured why the hell not, i could stand to get pretty drunk anyway. so last night we invited a ton of people over, which is not out of the ordinary for us, and my girlfriend invited her best friend. it started out as just a normal party, until chet got raging drunk and announced to everyone that he had just broken up with his girlfriend of 3 years. so, i did something sort of manipulative that i'm not totally proud of.

i told my girlfriend's best friend, i'll call her kim, that she should hook up with chet. we had all been drinking a lot, and i sort of suspected she was down for chet anyway, and she agreed enthusiastically. 

cut to chet sitting on our couch with kim quite literally on top of him making out.

i pointed this out to my girlfriend, telling her it would be so great if our bestfriends dated eachother.

my girlfriend lost it. like completely lost it. she started screaming and pushing kim off of chet, telling her she couldn't believe both of them would do that. she ended stopping the whole party because she made such a scene, and i just stood there and watched. when she finally snapped out of it and realized everyone was staring at her, i thanked her for confirming what i already knew, and told her to get the fuck out of my house.

that was last night. i'm still sort of in shock it went down like that. i went to bed right after, and haven't talked to anyone about it yet this morning. i don't really know how i can look chet in the face after this, so i haven't left my room yet. ",7

"i did things online at age 12 that i shouldn't have. i discovered omegle when i was around 11. my friends and i liked to go on video chat and talk to people. i don't know why it interested us so much.

anyone who's ever used omegle knows that there is an abundance of nudity on the site; its main use is essentially masturbation. this intrigued me, too, as i'd never been exposed to that before.

i started to visit the site without the company of my friends. i'd talk to people; i especially liked having conversations with older guys. having their attention made me feel important. by the time i was 12, these men started asking things of me. and i complied.

i started showing my breasts first. i didn't have much to show, but the guys still seemed to like them. i told them i was 18, and they somehow believed me, despite the fact that i hadn't even gotten my first period yet.

soon, my breasts weren't enough for people; they wanted to see more. i showed them, of course, because i didn't want to lose their interest. i started mutually masturbating with men, even though i didn't know how to do it properly so i wasn't really getting any pleasure out of it. i didn't even know what a clitoris was.

i feel incredibly guilty that i made these men unknowingly masturbate to someone who hadn't even gone through puberty. how were they supposed to know? i had started to develop breasts and hips by that point, so i probably just looked like a thin woman.

these men are obviously not at fault; they had no idea. but am i at fault? at the time, i was just a preteen who desperately craved attention and found a way to receive it. i didn't fully realize how awful the situation was until later in life.

as a side note, i know this post is kind of teetering on the edge of being against the rules, but i tried my best to describe this in the least graphic way. i just really needed to get this out. i'm not quite sure how to feel about the whole thing.

edit: thank you so much, everyone! i really appreciate the comments. i never knew how common this actually was for young girls; it's not something i ever talked to my friends about doing so i had no idea. i've always wondered whether those men knew i was lying about my age, but it seems most of you think they were aware. anyway, i didn't expect to get this much feedback, so i'm both overwhelmed and thankful.",12

"agreed to front money for a trip that had to be cancelled, now friends are refusing to pay the non-refundable costs (new york). let me preface this by saying that i'm not sure if my grievance has any legal standing, but i have evidence of it in the form of texts and facebook messages.

last year, three friends and i attempted to plan a week-long vacation abroad to iceland, where they had been before but i had not. 

two of them were fresh out of grad school and i was currently earning the biggest wage out of the four, so i agreed to book the flights and airbnb house on the promise of reimbursement for their shares. this was to have taken place in the fall of 2018.

prior to the trip taking place, one of them informed me that she had changed jobs in the interim and had not accrued enough leave time to make the trip. another told me that his boss had demanded that he chair a meeting that coincided with the trip, and threatened his promotion if he took the leave time. the third would not agree to come if their boyfriend (the second one) wasn't coming. 

so one by one they dropped out, after i had already spent some $2,800 in bookings. in spite of this, they assured me that they'd still recompense me the loss, since i was forced to cancel the whole thing, not wanting to travel solo to a place i had no experience in. 

airbnb fortunately refunded me most of the money, but the airline would only offer me non-transferrable credit with hefty rebooking fees and a strict time limit, which rendered the credit more or less useless. i wound up visiting the uk in february and plan to visit again this summer, but the airline that holds the credit doesn't offer a viable uk itinerary that i can use.

so it's been roughly seven months since the trip was due to take place, and i'm still owed roughly $1,200. the two who owe the bulk of it are increasingly avoiding me, in spite of their repeated promises to pay me back. i understand that their bosses were inflexible, if that's indeed what happened, but the deal was always that they would pay me back, trip or no trip.

i'm wondering if i have any legal avenues to pursue recompense if they continue to kick the can over this, and whether or not text and facebook messages are admissible evidence in this situation.",2

"for not tipping the pizza place on an order for 35 pizzas?. not my story, but my brother's, and i'm really unsure where i stand on it.

my little brother, is doing an internship with a large corporation. he organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins free pizza for lunch on a friday. 

at the conclusion of the food drive, my brother called the pizza place on a monday and asked about the logistics of ordering 35 pizzas, on a friday, during lunch hour. they said it wouldn't be a problem, and to place the order wednesday morning. 

he calls back wednesday, and speaks with the same manager. the manager tells him they can no longer do the order, as it's too big of an order to do during their friday lunch rush. he recommends my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following tuesday.

monday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the corporate credit card to pay over the phone. the manager then tells him they cannot have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready at 12:45. my brother tells him that would work. when asked what to put on the line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.

noon on tuesday, my brother shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to the winning office floor lunch room. then, he returns to the store to pick up the remaining 17 pizzas. 

while waiting for the second round of pizzas at the store, the following exchange occurs:

manager: ""are you going to leave a tip?""

brother: ""no.""

manager: ""usually with large orders like this you are required to leave a tip""

brother: ""you aren't delivering or serving these pizzas. when we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip"".

manager: ""it's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity"". 

brother: ""that isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. i'm not leaving a tip"".

manager: ""well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas"". 

at this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small tip (5%). my brother relents. he tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he wants to choose the amount. he hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead of $40).

my brother then gets into a yelling match with the manager, and is escorted out of the restaurant by his coworker.

"by applying for jobs with the windows 10 mail app for a year.. finally, i get to post one of these! and bonus, it happened today! this is pretty much the only bright side to the whole thing, sadly.

because i am human, i enjoy money, and i decided quite a while ago that i wanted more of it, so i started applying for other jobs. also, because i live in the 21st century, and you can't just wander into a building and instantly become the manager anymore, i've been doing all of these applications online. so, being the good little applicant that i am, i made sure my cv was perfect and up-to-date, and made sure to write a personalised cover letter for every single job i applied for. i thought i was doing a pretty good job, except for the fact that over the past few months, i haven't even been getting any rejections any more, much less positive replies or interviews.

this continued on for several months, and all the while, my self-esteem started to plummet. a whole bunch of idiots from my high school have decent jobs! i see them on facebook! how come i can't get one? last week, trying to be a little less direct in my approach, i decided to email a whole bunch of recruitment agencies too...and even they didn't reply. what? i could be making you money, guys! don't just ignore me! what are you, every girl i ever knew until age 17?

the fact that they didn't reply stirred up my curiosity. my cv is saved as a word document, but i use an alternative program. maybe the formatting is getting messed up and making me look unprofessional, and i can't see it on my pc? so, i decided to email my girlfriend to test it...using the windows 10 mail app. as i have been since probably last july.

i sent her an email with the cv attached, and the subject ""test"". this is what she received.(http://i.imgur.com/0vgvady.jpg) no attachments or anything. i then decided to try using the browser version of gmail, which i haven't done in a long time. it worked perfectly.

"for not letting my wife borrow my car anymore. hello redditors

me and my wife are both in our 40s and we've been married for about 15 years. i'm very passionated about sports cars and i own for the time being only a sports car. this led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6 months whenever she needed to get somewhere. i care for the car a lot as it was both expensive and was bought as a ""milestone"" in life that i've worked very hard for. well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent) that i was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. now, one week ago she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this part which comes out to about 2-3k.

so i told her that she will no be allowed to drive it anymore as i neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair the car as it will affect the value when i sell it if it has been repaired a lot etc.

so she got really upset about this and i told her that she should get her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. this blew into a pretty big fight and even though i didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out i still feel like she is pissed at me. so..

edit: to clarify: the sports car is the only car that i currently own, i used to have another car but i sold it. i've planned on getting another car for her to use as we had before in the future.

context update:  it's not like we barely have any money to spare. she makes over $100k a year (she makes a bit more than i do). and could go and buy a car today if she wanted to. the problem is just the fact that i don't let her drive my car which is pissing her off.

edit 2: saw this post blow up and thanks for all the replies. some made me think again on how this played out and i just wanted to answer a few questions here instead of replying to every single comment on the post.

1. my wife do not use the car to get to work, she gets picked up by her driver. yes driver. lol. (provided by her work).
2. she only uses the car when she wants to go shopping, we live in the city so it is only used when she is shopping ""heavy things"".
3. we've talked several times about her getting a car which she always postpones for some reason.
4. yes, i did ""warn"" her that i would not want her to be driving the car the first time she dented it.
5. i do no treat my wife as a child.
6. we have our own personal things that we own, she has a horse. the horse is hers not mine. the car is mine not hers. i'm not sure where all of you are from where everything in a marriage is splitted 50/50. we also own things together of course.
7. the reason i sold my ""other"" car is that i felt i already spent so much on this new car and i didn't want to have two cars when we do not use them for anything else but me hobby driving and her occasional shopping and some other minor things.
8. a lot of people wanna know, the car is a 2017 911 991 turbo
9. i'm not a multimillionaire and neither is she. that is the reason for why i'm not (as some people suggests) ""go out and buy her a car and get over with it"". i saved up for many many years for the car. i don't have money to buy another decent car for her to use without stretching my budget very very far.
10. a lot of people asking regarding the ""driver who picks her up"" and it not making sense earning 100k. i'm not sure it is normal at other companies but at hers they offer this service. my wife makes well over 100k, the reason i said 100k is because it thought it would be enough to prove my point that she can afford a car. she makes somewhere around 250. i make around 175. we have a lot of expenses, 5 kids all going to go to uni at some point so we're also saving for these types of things and therefore a lot of the money we make is automatically put into these funds and only a small portion goes into ""our own"" saving accounts. this is where i during the course of many many years saved up for my car, also we did not earn this much our entire lives. 
11. both the times she damaged the car it was in our parking garage, her fault. nobody else but her and the concrete pillars involved.

"by giving a dude head and texting my mom about it. final edit: i never thought this would get so popular, but apparently the thing to do is address some comments. first, i said in the op that i obviously stopped when i realized he was asleep. second, i do realize the irony of calling him a mess. it is what it is. 

this happened about 10 minutes ago.... 

i'm recently single living with my sister and her family. my mom and i talk every day, but i don't tell her about the dumb shit i do. anyway, i've been spending time with this guy that's definitely bad news. he works a ton, but he's a goddamn mess. 

my mom knows that i've been ""seeing"" this guy because my sister told her. she interrogated me about it tonight. i tried to say good things about him because otherwise it reflects badly on me...

anyway, dude and i are hanging out tonight drinking whiskey and beer. we have sex. i get off, but he doesn't. i decide to go down on him... and he fucking falls asleep. in. the. middle. 

obviously, i stop and text my best friend about it. except i text my mom and say ""he fell asleep with his dick in my mouth"" 😩😩😩😩 immediately text her back saying that wasn't meant for her... 

so, she's going to wake up tomorrow, to go to yoga, and see how i had some drunk dudes dick in my mouth who passed out. i don't know if she'll be more upset that i text her in the middle of the night or that i'm apparently so shitty that dudes pass out on me....

"by letting brain go automatic at the gym.. obligatory this-happened-last-week disclosure.

when i go to the gym, i put in my earphones and let the music absorb me. it eases the rest of the workout because it all feels like one swift process, and my brain goes on automatic, reflexively doing everything without strong conscious focus from me. that's usually not an issue, but, well...

it was time for my chest workout and i spotted a pair of benches lined up together, with the heads right against one another. one of them was free, and the other was occupied by a dude. now, this man was something. he looked like he was the sole supreme warrior of all the lands of pakistan. biceps and triceps bulging so much they look like they aboutta spill onto the ground and start lifting weights themselves. likely eats the equivalent of a hindu holy cow in his daily protein shakes.

fully absorbed by sia's chanting in my ears, i walk over. routinely, i remove the clamps and weights of the previous user on my bar and start searching for some 5kg weights. i take a few steps around, eyes scanning the floor and many racks for them, and my eyes finally set on a nice, jungle-green pair sitting on a rack. dutifully, i start removing the clamp on the rack as to reach the 5kg weight, with only a small, nagging voice in the back of my head wondering, *""why is there a clamp on this rack?""* and began to pull out the weight.

and then, it happened.

the enchanting harmony of sia's voice was penetrated by a booming, **hey!**

my hands freeze, and my neck cranes upwards to see commander pakistan himself lying down on his bench, looking ready to start his bench press with his hands gripping the bar above him, which just so happened to line up perfectly with the rack i was dealing wi— oh. that's when it dawned on me. the ""rack"" i was pulling weights off was, in fact, the bar he was using, and i was about to casually give this guy a serious injury had he lifted the bar, ignorant to my oblivious meddling.

i ripped out my earphones, threw my hands back, and immediately started to apologize. initially, i saw only trickles of smoke toot out the ears of our south asian demi-god—indicating he was only slightly pissed; later he seemed to find it funny, even cordially giving me tips for my workout. very chill guy.

but damn, boys and girls. my automatism could've seriously injured someone, and boy did i fu.

"for running through neighborhoods in the early morning, making security lights come on and dogs bark?. i (26f) like to go for a run in the morning before i go to work. i usually set out around 5:00 am so i can make sure to get at least 5 miles in at a time before having to get ready for work. well depending on the time of year, i'm either running around sunrise or wrap up before, which means that people in the neighborhood have those security lights that pop up if you're in the area.

well people started complaining about their lights being triggered and their dogs flipping out at early times, and people on their stupid doorbell cameras will look at people going by and several people posted videos of me running by. i'm identifiable because i have a headlamp and flashers to make sure cars see me.

this was on that nextdoor app so i chimed in to say hey, sorry about that! and got dogpiled by people telling me to change up my route, or have more respect. some people told me to go to a gym, why don't i run in the afternoon or evening etc etc. i told them i had no way of remembering whose house has what lights or what dogs and that it's just something we all have to deal with. i'm not going around complaining about the sprinklers that come on and drench me because they aren't calibrated right! and then said that i love to run in the morning because it makes me feel good through the day to which someone said ""yeah try getting woken up by some smartass who won't be neighborly enough to just go to the gym!""

anyway i've gotten some really nasty notes and people keep posting videos of me and comments saying that i should really get a gym membership and other people calling me rude because the dog barks and wakes up the baby or something. i don't enjoy running on a treadmill. never have, never will. besides why pay out the ass to be leered at and hit on by gross dudes when i can run in the darkness and watch the sun rise? seems like a no-brainer, right?

1 - there are no parks nearby large enough for me to run in. the only one around here is about one block, and it is surrounded by houses. i pass this park already. there are no ""trail systems"" or anything like that either. 

2 - i don't run the same exact path every day. no matter which street i run on, there's inevitably security lights and dogs. i have 5 or 6 different routes i'll take. i don't think it's even the same dogs barking at me on those routes. 

3 - i don't have a car, so i can't just drive out somewhere else. 

4 - again, i'm not getting a gym membership. my budget doesn't include that kind of luxury, and the closest affordable gym here is about 6 miles away to begin with. 

5 - i can't run later in the morning. i have to be out the door at a certain time to get my full 5 miles in.  5:00-630, exercise (warm up and cool down included). 6:30-7:30, getting ready (shower, coffee, breakfast, put together lunch or it's already made, makeup, hair, getting dressed). if i don't leave for the bus at 7:45, i will not get to work on time.

"i just found out i waste around 400$ a month because of improper food management.. i've been a cook from 16 to 23 and i usually ate at my job and bought some quick meal at the grocery store because i was too lazy to actually cook when i was at home. meanwhile, i was also a college student with not enough money to actually buy in bulk and i didn't have the will to organize my life properly. in other words, it was : many trips to fast-food restaurants, coffee machines/shops, bunch of trips to the overpriced convenience stores, etc.


lately, i've graduated from college and i now live in a rural area with my girlfriend. the rent is cheap (350$ / month for a rented house, so 700 overall), i have a good 8-5 job, and the overall cost of living is pretty cheap. but i noticed i didn't have the money i *should* have. i did a quick budget and i noticed i barely had to spend 50% of my income in all the essential stuff. and yet, i had a hard time gathering money.



well, apparently, i still had the same ""life"" i did during college, except that i bought more expensive things. i looked up my debit card record and i noticed how brutal my expenses were.


about 100-150$ monthly went to convenience stores.

about 150$ went to non-social restaurants (grabbing a subway for lunch or ordering pizza for example).


about 300$ went to the grocery store (gf spends about 150-200). way too much, considering it's for about 20 days worth of food.


it doesn't even include trips where we'd eat at the restaurant. 



so yeah, this was an eye-opener to me. it took me 5 months to realize i didn't adapt to a more serious and organized ""adult"" life. thanks god it was only 5 months, though. but ever since, i've tried making efforts at cooking food at home, buying in bulk (now that i can afford it), making my own coffee, making my own lunch for work, etc. it's not about being cheap, really. i'm still eating tasty and healthy food. it's all about being intelligent about it... and man, i'm saving a crapload of money!

"by riding horses, having long hair and labia.. i am spooked and mortified right now. 

so i'm a female with rather long hair who rides horses - i have 3, compete regularly etc. 

anyway, yesterday i was happily riding my first of two horses for the day, when about half way through i thought i had a *front* wedgie. no big deal, pull/shuffle it out and move on, yeah? a little while later i felt it again and pulled it out again. 

i finished my ride, tacked up the second horse, then rode him. again i kept feeling this discomfort wedgie, they weren't even the right pants to give me a wedgie! 

anyway i shook it off as no biggie, finished the horses for the night, went home, showered, then went out to see some friends. 

this morning, i awoke at around 6.30am with intense labial pain. yep. so i grab a mirror and have a look and oh jeez it's a horror. there is a dark red lump. a big one. perhaps fingernail sized. at first i thought my clit was inflamed. nope, not that... std? googled them all. nope. a moment later i realise *there is a hair hanging off it*. yep. i think i have given myself a labial hair tourniquet.

with my hair length i often end up with hair on my clothing *edit: my hair is always tied back when i ride, the hair must have slithered into my pants beforehand* so i'm thinking the friction from riding caused the hair to get looped around. apparently showering means the hair gets looser and when it dries it tightens... so uh. i'm on my way to a &amp; e as i can't remove it myself. there is definitely a hair dangling down. maybe around 4 inches. i didn't notice anything last night. 

my hair is between waist and butt length.

i can't wait to have some doctors look at my poorly labia ): 

**edit**: just confirming its hair from my head that is looped around. 

**update 1**
doctor number one has looked at my foofie and referred me to a gynaecologist on a ward. she agrees it's a hair tourniquet... they need specialist equipment and numbing things. it's rather swollen. f my luck. 

**update 2**
the nurses at gynaecology managed to untie and cut the hair after some fiddling about. they'd never had a case like it before... so it's pretty rare my fellow gals. still be careful and vaginalant. they said i definitely did the best thing going to them rather than trying to do it myself, i'm blonde as well so it was almost invisible! plus the swelling made it difficult to see. 

also i must've caught it quick, none of the tissue has died or anything but i need to keep an eye on it. feeling a bit bruised. 

**update 3**
thank you for gold omg, at least i got something good out of this hahaha, trying to respond to comments but sorry if i lose track <3 

**update 4**
clarifying location for some confused redditors! it was to the right then lower of the urethra and the ball was almost spherical and the size of a fingernail. it was a human head hair, and though it first became caught while riding the real fu was when i showered and didn't notice the hair that must have been caught, then it became further tangled through the night and evening. i finished riding at around 7.30pm. 

**update 5** 
we have made the front page... brilliant... 😂

**update 6** 
(removed - there are pictures similar to my case but there are concerns about the medical file due to the potential age of the case study)

i've gotta get on with my life for a few hours, but i'll make a point of responding to comments directed at me this evening. lots of love fellows.

"many people seem to have lots of money on here. i have an income of ~30k a year, i have bills like anyone else, and would like to financially progress to the point that i am more financially secure. i am not opposed to hard work and dedication, i have ~90 credits in college but haven't gone in 1 year. most of these credits are in social sciences towards my associates degree in criminal justice.

my steps i can infer myself are:

find a better paying job as is

learn a skill to improve job hours, regularity and open my schedule for schooling.

find an affordable school in south east pennsylvania where i will be eligible for in state tuition in 10 months

i am aware of mit's advertised free online courseware and have an interest in computer science, health/nutrition as well as math. i just don't know the path of achieving and completing these steps so to apply them in my overall goal of financial progress. what are my options to advance my career away from retail management, and educate myself into a position where i can choose a career path that is more fulfilling and financially secure? 

i am aware many people are on here trading tips on stocks, putting away for retirement, playing with amounts of money i don't make in a year and that's great, i can strive for that but first and foremost my goal is to continue to feel stable on my feet, as i currently feel that something like my car breaking down, or substantial speeding ticket for instance would result in financial ruin.

"i (28m) ruined my girlfriends (23f) family's favorite movie and now they hate me. for the last year and a half i've been dating a girl i met through a friend. we get along extremely well- we both love movies, the same music, stand up
comedians, i'm an avid filmmaker and she likes to edit- everything has been great. 
she's not from around here and we decided to fly out and have me meet her family for the first time. it's been going relatively well in my opinion, but tonight we decided to watch their favorite movie: the fourth kind.
for those that don't know, it's an alien abduction movie that tries to act like all of the events are 110% true. i'd never seen it so they wanted to show me. halfway through the movie her dad said something along the lines of ""i wonder why this wasn't a big deal when it happened?"" to which i said ""well the movie is fake- them saying the events were real is a bunch of shit."" 
apparently for the last 10 or so years they've believed that the movie was true. the whole family immediately freaked out at me- her dad kicked me out of the house and now i'm waiting to fly back home a week and a half early. i've tried to call my girlfriend but she hasn't said anything to me yet. what should i do to remedy the situation?


update nearly 24 hours later: girlfriend and i have talked- her and her family got in a huge fight after i left and came home. apparently her dad was mainly upset of my polish heritage (they're swedish so i guess there's bad blood there? i'm not too caught up on that) and me pointing out that the fourth kind is fake was just kind of the tipping off point. she agrees that her family is kind of crazy too. i guess we won't see them that often!",7
"update hit another milestone today. after 1,000 days of not smoking here are my stats!. original post https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3fay73/i_hit_a_milestone_today_ive_officially_saved_800/

**assumptions**

* 16 cigarettes per day (this is where it was when i quit, i'd probably be over a pack by now if i let the trend continue)

* $7 per pack. (i initially used $6.50 but prices have increased significantly since i quit, $7 is probably still a lowball)

**results**

* days quit: 1001

* cigarettes not smoked: 16,016

* money saved: $5,606

* time not spent smoking: 66 days, 17 hours, and 36 minutes

* 54% of the way to being at the same risk of lung cancer as a non-smoker

last time i posted regarding this i had talked about being excited that we could use the money saved to buy a bed. well unfortunately the apartment complex got bedbugs so that is long gone. however we have since been able to save up enough to purchase a house, where my fiance and i now live. i'm also glad to report that she has also been smoke free for almost 2 years. 

quitting smoking has drastically increased my productivity at work. it turns out that your social circle actually expands pretty significantly when you no longer smell like an ashtray constantly. i also qualify for much cheaper supplemental life insurance through my employer now that i don't have to list myself as having smoked in the past 12 months. i cannot stress the intangible benefits of quitting enough.

"by orgasming so hard i broke my vagina.. by orgasming so hard i broke my vagina

happened a couple of days ago, as is tradition. throwaway because some irl folks know my normal handle on here.


so a couple of months ago my doctor put me on a new ssri to help with my chronic depression. it didn't work that well and made me super-dazed, and on top of that my sex drive dried up to a level that can only be described as ""sahara-like."" now, it's not like i'm in a relationship or anything, but i still enjoyed getting off at least a couple times a week, and found myself very wound up without my normal release.


i told my doctor that the medication just kind of put me in a fog, so she switched me to an snri and holy horniness my sex drive came back with a vengeance. after work one day, i came home and decided to treat myself to a round or two with my vibrator, to celebrate. well, it had been building up so long in me that i went to town and had one of the most intense orgasms of my life. i should note at this point that i didn't use lube, because i was so..worked up..i figured i didn't need it.


sounds great, right? eh..not so much, because right after finishing the deed, i realized i had a shooting pain in my vagina, like i had badly pulled a muscle. after spending a couple of minutes laying in state, praying to every god and deity out there to make the pain subside, i made the long, labored waddle to the toilet, only to realize i was dripping a lot of blood, too. 


before you ask, no, it was not shark week for me, so needless to say, i was surprised. upon further inspection, i realized that i not only pulled a muscle deep in my lady parts that had me walking funny for a day, i suffered a vaginal tear due to my..vigor..as well. however, it was a lot more blood than any little tears i had had in the past, and prior to this, i never tore from masturbating, so i was convinced i really badly injured myself, and may need stitches.


i called my ob's office and made an appointment, and i explained what happened, all while turning shade of purple that barney the dinosaur would envy. my doctor took a look and welp, i was right, i needed stitches, and instructed me that in the future during any particularly-intense sessions, i should probably use lube, just to be safe. ironically, now i now have to once again abstain from all sexual activity for a period of time, so i'm back to square one. 


needless to say, the whole experience was not what i was expecting, and has been something i would prefer to not experience, ever again.


tl;dr got super horny, overdid it during a solo session, and broke my vagina.

edit: thanks for all the lube tips, guys. just ordered (look up the drum of lube on amazon, was apparently inadvertently linking to my wishlist, too) so i think i'm good to go for future sexytimes! (not really, but i did order a few different brands suggested and really appreciate it!)

edit 3: gold! holy crap, thank you, internet stranger! who knew my most read post would ever be about injuring my vajayjay...i'll take this opportunity to throw out a lube, lube, and lube some more! also, know if you pull a muscle while orgasming, the pain is intense but it should only last a day or so.",4
"update md condo assoc. sent a letter citing inappropriate bylaws to restrict my kid from doing basically anything.. op: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c1ft6g/md_condo_assoc_sent_a_letter_citing_inappropriate/

the board meeting was yesterday. when the floor was opened to owner commentary, i raised my hand and told them that we'd moved in about 6 months ago and what i liked about the community before telling them about the letter and what it said. i ended with, ""when i got this letter, it made me feel like community isn't a welcoming place for young families."" 

it turns out that the letter was sent out without the full knowledge and consent of the board. in fact, they had no idea that it was sent out. the president of the board was livid that i and 6 other families that i know of received this letter and told us that our kids were allowed and encouraged to play on their scooters and bikes on the sidewalk. they don't want the kids to play in the parking lots for their safety. they also ask that kids stay out of plantings and off the grass. then she referred us to the playground that has several safety concerns and mentions the new layers of wood-chips that had been put down at the beginning of summer. 

i told her that while we appreciate the new layer of wood-chips i still had some safety concerns. 

* the end of the slide is about two feet off the ground and when my three year old goes down she shoots off the end like a cannon.

*the nylon covering on the climbing structure has come off and i'm worried my kids fingers could get hurt. 

*there's a strange lurid green fungus the size of a hockey puck by the swings. when you poke it it lets off spores and oozes. 

they'll have a contractor come out to give an estimate to fix the playground. 

the person that sent the letter was counting on us to be intimidated by official stationary, not to talk to each other, and discouraged by the inconvenient board meetings. i'm especially upset that six or seven families that i know of received this letter and four of them were renters/people of color. one person is a single man whose nephew visited him for a weekend and brought his bike. i plan on joining the board once i've been here a bit longer and implementing community-building events so that people don't feel so alone. 

hope you all have a wonderful day!",2
"update: my (21m) best friend (20f) found out that i have self harm scars and has told our entire friendship group (19-21). they are now excluding me from almost everything.. you can find my original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csy8ds/my_21m_best_friend_20f_found_out_that_i_have_self/)

i know since the internet doesn't like to be left hanging, so i thought i'd give you guys the update on my situation. it's sadly not the happy ending that i was hoping for.

after i read all the advice on my original post, and responded to pms and answered questions, i decided i'd message each friend individually to ask if the general consensus of the group was really what allie said it was (with everyone being uncomfortable, and preferring that i didn't come to the beach).

through doing this, i sadly found out that allie was telling the truth. every single person in my friend group except for 2 said that my scars would make them uncomfortable at the beach (keeping in mind, i never said i'd go to the beach), and they'd rather i didn't come.

i told them all how much it hurt that they'd say this to me, and how upset i was that i was basically being abandoned by my friends, and that i didn't want to associate with them anymore because of how hurt i felt, and those messages were met with either no reply, or simply ""i'm sorry, i don't know what you want me to do about that.""

as for the 2 friends who weren't uncomfortable, they both confided in me that they have also struggled with self-harm in the past and were disgusted by the behaviour of the others in the group. one of people has chosen to stay with the group, and the other has told me that she'd like to remain friends, but still hang out with those people on occasion

so in conclusion, i lost 9 friends, i feel like shit, and i don't know if my self esteem will ever make a recovery from this.

have a wonderful day, wherever you are.

**edit: for those commenting ""you didn't lose 9 friends, you lost 9 people who didn't care about you"". i understand that they weren't my friends, my wording was poor.**",7

"by enraging the parents of my girlfriend by pretending not to know what a potato is.. let me tell you that i have made a bad mistake this evening. 

my girlfriend (who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time) said i am ""invited to dinner"" with her and her parents. i was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. but i knew it must be done. 

i met them nicely, i should tell you, and it started off in a good way. the idea slapped my mind that i should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing. 

when i saw that baked potatoes were served i got the idea that it would be very good if i pretended i did not know what potatoes was. that would be funny.

well let me tell you: backfired on my face. i'll tell you how. 

so first when the potato became on my plate, i acted very interesting. i showed an expression on my face so as to seem that i was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. they did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. so i asked ""this looks very interesting. what is this?"" 

they stared at me and the mother said ""it's a baked potato.""  and i was saying ""oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?"" 

and she was like ""a potato."" 

and i was like ""a 'potato', oh interesting. never heard of a potato, looks pretty good."" 

and then they didn't see i was clowning, but thought i really did not know what is a potato. so i knew i would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if i admitted to making a bad joke, so what i did was to act as if it was not a joke but i committed to the act of pretending i didn't know what a potato is. 

they asked me, very incredulous, did i really not know what a potato is? that i never heard of a potato. i went with it and told them, yes, i did not ever even hear of a potato. not only had i never eaten a potato i had never heard the word potato. 

this went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my ""fucked up antics"", and then the more insistent i was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking i did know what a potato was.

well let me tell you i had to commit 100% at this point. when i would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. at one point he said something like ""enough is enough. you're fucking with us. admit it.""  and i said ""sir, before today i never heard of a potato. i still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. i don't know what to tell you."" 

well let me tell you he got very annoyed. i decided to take a bite of the potato, and when i did i made a high pitched noise and said ""taste's very strange!"" 

that is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying ""what are you doing?"" and my girlfriend went to some other room. 

finally the father said i should ""get the fuck out of his house"" and i said it was irrational to treat me like this just because i never heard of a potato before. well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. 

now in text messages i have been telling my girlfriend i really don't know what a potato is. the only way i can ever get out of this is for them to buy that i don't know what a potato is. 

i wish i never started it but i can't go back. i think she will break up with me anyway. ",4

"can my dad really hire a bounty hunter to kidnap me from college and take me home? (ms/tn). i'm a freshman at a good school in tennessee. my dad is a really difficult guy and has just gotten worse since i left for school. to make a long story short, when i stopped checking in every day he started calling the dean, and when the dean's office stopped taking his calls he started showing up here. the school really had my back and banned him from campus. 

now he's calling my friends and their parents and saying i have to come home (my mom won't take his calls anymore and the court won't make her). my dad says that i ""lack the legal standing for self-determination"" because i'm a minor, since in mississippi you're a minor until you're 21. he says that he's hired a ""youth transportation service"" to ""escort"" me home. like those people who kidnap gay kids in the middle of the night and take them to conversation camps. bounty hunters for kids. 

i told him that the fugitive slave act is a goner and that i only have to obey the laws of the state i'm in, which designates me an adult with the right to remain unkidnapped. he said that i'm bound by the ""long arm statute"" and that i haven't even established residency in tennessee because i've only been here since mid-august and i'm still registered to vote in mississippi. 

so i guess my main question is my title: is he right, can he really send someone to kidnap me and take me back to mississippi? my mom says this is just him being crazy and trying to intimidate me but obviously i want to cover all my bases.

if he's wrong, what can i do if that actually does happen? if some guy comes up to me and zipties my hands and says i have to go with him, do i? can i fight back? if my friends are nearby and see me being kidnapped, can they help me? since the episode that got my dad banned from campus, i've had a couple hefty guy friends offer to walk me back and forth from class. if one of them is with me and someone tries to take me, do they have to just let it happen, or do they have a right to help me not get kidnapped?

i think that's all my questions for now. thanks!

"2nd update for ""my teenage son is being sexually groomed"". original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/62hwid/my_teenage_son_is_being_sexually_groomed/)
first update(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/69aro6/update_my_teenage_son_is_being_sexually_groomed/)

this is to carry on the timeline and process for anyone else in a similar predicament. it's insanely long but hopefully thorough. 


we got an update from the detective a couple of days ago and i think things have come to a conclusion. i am so impressed with him and all he has done for us. i don't know if y'all will like how this is going to play out but we very much understand the ""reality"" of this situation. it's infuriating but indicative of the society we live in, especially in the south.


i want to clarify some details for ease of understanding the big picture. the person who was grooming my son is a woman around age 40. my son is age 15, turning 16 later this year. 


we've learned that predators have specific victims that they exploit; absent parents, kids with troubled backgrounds, low self esteem, access to the child, etc. on the surface, my son seemed perfect to groom.


we adopted him when he was 14 years old after only knowing him one month. he is black and we are white. he had a completely shitty childhood concerning his environment and people who raised him. thank whatever higher power that he is the complete opposite of his upbringing. he has busted his ass to climb out of that hellhole and has succeeded every step of the way. this child has raised himself, we just give him the tools he needs to succeed faster. we gave him a complete fresh start with no attachments to his old life. we are not, by any fucking stretch, knights in shining armor, all accolades go to him. all we did was throw him a life preserver, he has done all the swimming. it is a privilege and joy to share his life, he is extremely humble, kind, generous, and stunningly well adjusted. he conducts himself with more grace and tact then any person i've ever known. 


he loves us and his new siblings fiercely, loyally, and very protectively. we feel the exact same towards him. this is our child, he is from our hearts, if not our bodies.


see, that's where sick bitch fucked up. she mistook his independence and our trust in him as indifference. despite circumstances, our kid is a far, far cry from a 'troubled youth'. if anything, he is vulnerable, not an aggressor. she had no fucking clue of the depth and strength of our family. she didn't know the private side of our family life, only the public. she thought he was easy picking and, in a way, he was an ideal target. he has had to learn what is appropriate from parental figures and learn how healthy family relationships operate. he never had that growing up, he didn't know what is ""normal"" so he was easy to manipulate using a maternal approach. this is how he missed so many blatant red flags.


her life: very attractive white woman, happily married for quite a while, strong leadership and ties in the local church, college degree, works with children... you get the picture.


here's what it comes down to and i'll attempt to explain it accurately. in order to charge her with sexual exploitation of a minor, there has to be ""intent"".the detective was unable to prove ""intent"". from what i understand, all of the grooming that she was doing must be for the purpose to promote a sexual relationship. since there was no physical contact or her asking, saying, or obvious instigation that her actions were towards establishing sexual contact, ""intent"" can not be proven.  she was interrupted with her toe on the line. if this hadn't been caught at the precise point that it was, the detective is positive that she would have progressed much further. i am counting blessings over here.


both sides of their stories, timeline, and events matched up perfectly. her defense? she says that she had a huge lapse in judgement and it's being horribly misconstrued. she claims that she was acting as a friend, got caught up in a teenage mentality, feels horrible about the whole thing, blah, fucking blah, fucking blah.  everybody agrees that she was grooming our kid, no shadow of a doubt, it just didn't go far enough to prove sexual intent. we couldn't prove that she wanted to have sexual relations, only that she was viewing sexual material with him and discussing sexual subjects. of course that is a relief but at the same time, i'm infuriated.


hopefully someone with a better grasp of the law can explain this and make it easier to understand. we understand, it's just hard to put into words!


we were told that the da's decision to move forward would heavily depend on our wishes. moving forward would be weighed on proven evidence and on my son's testimony. the detective very tactfully and compassionately voiced our unspoken thoughts (my summation not his); it would be so fucking easy for a defense lawyer to make this my son's fault. black, athletically fit, minor with a broken history, alone with a white woman who was scared or coerced into playing along. upstanding white woman, relentlessly apologetic with hordes of people to testify of her integrity. deep community ties up against the new kid in town.


it would be a breeze to turn preconceptions and insinuations into the ""truth"".


i cannot elaborate on this anymore it is too fucking enraging and horribly corrupt. i will leave all the rage to be explored in the comments... i could fill a novel.


if this were my decision to make, i'd do my best to destroy the bitch. however, this is my son's life - he would effectively be blamed during a trial, his life and history up for display, our family and parenting gutted and picked apart, and once again, he would live with constant stress and humiliation. right now this is a private situation. if it became public, he is terrified of the teasing, hatred, condemnation, and frustration of exposing this person. plus, we all know how this situation plays out in regards to older woman ""fantasies"" and the hypocrisy of how female predators are perceived.


at this point, kiddo's life has never been better and he is terrified to jeopardize his security and happiness. he has already paid dearly for shitty adults that abused him and he is adamant that he does not want to be the sacrificial lamb. he says does not want to give up his hard fought peace in the name of justice. we completely understand and support his decision.


we have spoken with the da and have mutually decided to not pursue this due to the detriment it would cause our son.


during the conversation, the detective walked me through the steps in his investigation. he works the second shift so the majority of his legwork is conducted during the early evening hours. he asked me to read between the lines and understand that he had to remain professional and unbiased. he is a family man.


- she was provided a ride for all 3 of the interviews, conducted at times of his choosing and convenience



- all phones, personal computers, and other evidence was collected by several officers during late afternoon, early evening hours. it took around two hours. all of the spouses electronics were confiscated as well.



- interviews were very intense and very very thorough. he elaborated more than this and it was very satisfying to hear.



- she was asked and had to account for every single video, message, and other evidence that was found on her devices. all the evidence corroborated my son's story perfectly, no discrepancies at all.



there were some more things but this is already insanely long. if anyone has experience with police investigations and can add anymore to this, please do!


all things said, more good came from this than harm. though her actions were deliberate efforts to cause pain and destroy, the outcome brought forth love, compassion, and knowledge. my son now has even more strong, kind, and resourceful mentors in his life. fuck her, she lost.


thank you all so very much. your kindness, support, and advice has been a huge source of comfort for me. much love to all.

"by losing weight and hanging out the washing.. so this actually happened maybe ten minutes ago.

bit of context. my neighbours are extreme curtain twitchers. our back gardens are currently open to each other since a fence blew down and neither of us has the money to replace it just yet.

i'm a big guy, about 6ft1 (186cm) and i've been heavy for some time but when the scales touched 25 stone (350 lbs, 160kg ) i figured it was time to do something. so i've been eating better and losing some weight. i haven't lost much but it's enough to make my clothes' waistbands irritatingly unable to stay put.

today i'm lounging in some loose comfortable pants (soft material made for lounging or sleeping - decorated with dangermouse for anyone who cares) which are quite old with little elastic left in the waist. the wife is out with the kids and i'm getting on with some work. i've already had a strange interaction with next door neighbour (check it out over on choosingbeggars if u like.)

this being britain, the sun quickly disappears and i hear the rain begin. ""oh no"" i think, ""the washing is out on the line and if it gets wet again i won't hear the end of it."" so i head out and go to bring in the washing, i reach up for the first piece and my slightly smaller than usual waist betrays me. my arms are in the air unclipping pegs and my pants slide down. now the unfortunate side is that i am also blessed with an arse and hips unable to keep pants up (thanks mam). i can't stop them without dropping washing on the now wet ground. 

you guessed it, those soft comfy pants are now heading for my knees, taking my also loose boxer shorts with them. my package is now floating free and easy in the late summer breeze.

i rapidly fold up the item of clothing and shove it in the bag, and go to yank my pants up, when i suddenly lock eyes with my neighbour. she's there at her window, twitching aside her blinds, ogling my junk. might have only been a fraction of a second but it felt like hours we looked at each other through that window for.

now this woman is in her sixties and lives next door with her son, both of whom i'm fairly sure have learning disabilities. we've had several strange interactions with them over the years, but i think her viewing my cold-shrivelled pecker dangling in her window is possibly the worst.

i'm sure the wife will howl with laughter when i tell her. 

tldr: lost weight recently causing my pants to fall down while collecting hung washing, exposing myself to a nosy neighbour.

edited to fix an autocorrect.

update: well this seems to have entertained far more people than i was expecting. thanks for the silvers. i find it amusing my first awards are for public indecency. just happy i could brighten so many people's day. i tried to reply to as many as i could but it's bed time now.

for those who are wondering, the wife laughed just as i suspected she would. many thanks for all the kind words for the weight loss, and the pointers to the belts (not that they go with lounge pants but work trousers or jeans are just as disobedient right now).

finally, i'm sorry i can't tell you where to get dangermouse pants these days. i bought mine from asda (uk version of walmart) around 4 or 5 years ago and haven't seen them anywhere since.",4

i haven't seen him or his kids for over 10 years now as i've gone no contact with the family for my own reasons. today both of his kids reached out to me. they both told me that they know i'm their real dad and want me to meet with them. i respectfully declined and told them that while they are biologically mine, i'm not their dad. since then i've been getting texts and calls from the family telling me im terrible. both of his kids seem to be devastated for some reason and really want to meet me and are acting like i'm rejecting them.

"car got towed from both designated spot and visitor's spot at apartment complex, other tenants having same problem, 3 days still no response from property management.. i've been living in the same apartment complex (college park, md) with parents for the past almost five years. we always used the same parking passes, just like everyone else, but suddenly one morning my car gets towed from our designated spot. towing company reasoning is ""your passes are no longer valid. you need to speak with your property manager."" neither my parents or i were ever informed about any new parking passes or anything. met other tenants in the same building who also got their cars towed despite having a pass, and were never informed about new passes.

i try to get in contact with property management, call their company number and not even a receptionist answers. end up going down the extension list, trying to get a hold of anyone, still no answers. property management's emergency line is the only one where somebody answers, and every time it's just an operator who says will pass on my message to a manager. the operator was at least helpful and said she's passing on my message to multiple managers. still no call back, and every time i call back there never seems to be any manager available, regardless of time of day. i tell operator to mention in the message that i'm going to go pick up my car, because otherwise the fees will keep piling up, but i demand to be paid back for this. emphasis on the fact that other tenants including me are getting towed despite never being informed about new parking passes.

pick up my car in the morning, figure well if my pass is now no longer valid that means i can't park in my own designated spot, so i'll just park in a visitor's spot. four hours later, my car gets towed again. reason? ""you need a pass for visitor spots now, too."" at this point i'm absolutely livid, we suddenly can't park in our designated spots or visitor spots with out some new parking passes, and i'm now $450 down the drain. we were never informed about new passes, and we can't even get new passes because property management is being unresponsive.

what can the other tenants and i possibly do about this?

\*\*update\*\*: wow i can't believe my most popular post on reddit is me being pissed about my car getting towed lol also for people asking, no i don't got to umd, and no the apartment is not in anyway affiliated with the school. alright so me and two other tenants (just for clarification, my parents legally own our apartment, the two other tenants are renting their apartment from somebody) tried going to the address provided by the emergency line, turns out it's wrong and they haven't been in that address in years. great start. we're finally able to get the new address, head there, and was able to get a hold of the property manager of our complex. he does give us all the new parking passes, which is good i guess. he claims that a (1) notice was sent out via mail back on march 28, and he handed all three of us a copy of them. neither my parents or i ever received this notice in the mail, and the two other tenants' landlord claims he never received the notice either. he also claims, and is also stated in the notice, that on may 2nd he and a member of the board of directors were in the parking lot between 5:30-7:30pm handing out the new parking passes as a courtesy. not going door to door, or even entering the actual apartment complex, just hanging around the parking lot. he also claims that he is not involved with or personally authorized the towing company. when asked who was responsible, he said the board of directors. when asked for the board of directors' contact information, he said that he can only give that information to the property owners (aka my parents and the two other tenants' landlord). the property manager was also overall pretty snarky and rude with us, kept deflecting the fact that i wasn't getting any responses from the 3 days worth of phone calls, saying that isn't his responsibility, and then telling the three of us ""you kids need to learn how to control your tempers.""

it's great that we got the new parking passes while we were there, but this is still absurd. at this point, what should be our best course of action? and could we still possibly take this court? the other two tenants did say they were gonna get in contact with their lawyer and would definitely keep in touch for this.",2

"family left me (18m) when they thought i wasn't my dad's son but now they want to get back in touch. bunch of friends reddit, so alt

i don't think the technical details will matter a lot, so i'll get right down to business.

4 years ago, dad found out my mom had a life long affair (more than one, but that's another story). he knew about a couple of affairs she had in the past and forgave her, hanging in there for the kids, moving on, yada yada 

but that time (4 years ago), he found out me and my two siblings might not be his kids, considering time of affair.

this was the first time we all heard of mom's, well, everything really.

there was a whole dna thing and it turned out my siblings were my dad's, and i was not.

cool right. so dad leaves mom, divorces her, moves out, takes both my siblings with him. not me tho

i stay behind with mom, who hits a new low finding herself alone, and we both become pretty much outcasts as far as most of the family is concerned. my older brother was particularly mean to me. we were really tight before, and the shit he did to me, i swear, had i been bigger at the time, i would have punched him hard, more than once.

i don't wanna get into details because i can't since i could be recognized, but stuff happened and i got dna again and as it turns the fuck out, dna #1 was messed up and and i am my dad's kid.

now, i don't need legal advice on this. grandpa is the man, always had my back, we got a lawyer and are looking to settle. 

but dad wants back in my life. brother is calling and wanting to meet up and talk shit.

i don't fucking want to.

i want these people out of my life.

mom already forgave everyone, she is going on a ""date"" with my dad and i feel sick, but not my business right

i wish them both good fucking luck, but i want none of it. only nobody leaves me be. i keep hearing that they're family, and i ought to hear them out and give them a chance or i'll regret it later, and that the only reason i wont talk to them is cause i'm a teen and stupid or some other shitty explanation. 

so, give me some perspective here, please. do i sound unreasonable when i say, thanks, but fuck no, thanks?

"update an employee has obtained a personal video of me and is showing it to others.. since my last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az3vqw/an_employee_has_obtained_a_personal_video_of_me/) gained some attention i'm posting an update. 

after i submitted the post on saturday i called my director. he has been my mentor and a trusted friend since i started at the company three years ago, and was already aware that the relationship between myself and my ex was a thing that happened. i'd been told that my employee had gone directly to him, i'm assuming to smear me, so i knew i had to speak to him about it directly. i was expecting an i-told-you-so type conversation, but he was kind, understanding, and completely nonjudgmental. he told me he doesn't look at me any differently and no one else does either who matters. he also made my decision about whether or not to go to hr much easier. since he's a director and she brought it to him he was obligated to report it. this was basically the best case scenario for me. i'd had several of her friends come to me and ask me not to go to hr and to let her work it out of her system. now i can say that the decision to bring it to them was completely out of my hands. 

i got a phone call from hr this morning asking me to report immediately to them. i asked if i could go to my building first to clock in and change, and they told me nope - asap. i sat down with them and they were also totally kind and completely nonjudgmental and supportive. they got the full story, the names of everyone involved, and asked a lot of good questions. they also confirmed what commentors on the last post told me, that i'd done nothing wrong and had nothing to be ashamed of. they even told me that they will do whatever they can to protect my reputation as the investigation moves forward. from what i've heard both the avp and the director of hr have dedicated their entire day today to interviews with people so i feel confident that this is being handled as it should. 

they called her in this afternoon to get her story and suspended her with pay pending the investigation. as an aside, as my manager drove her to the corporate office for the meeting she told him how she's ""the real victim here."" the mental gymnastics just totally baffles me. i've been advised to document everything, including any interactions with her friends, in case there is any hostile workplace environment concerns.

"do firefighters have to tackle electric car fires differently?. compared to petrol or diesel car fires. i can think of several potential hazards with an electric car fire - electrocution, hazardous chemicals released from the batteries, reactions between battery chemicals and water, lithium battery explosions. on the other hand an all-electric car doesn't have flammable liquid fuel.

but do the different hazards actually affect firefighting practice, or do firefighters have a generic approach anyway?

update 19 june: wow. thanks for awesome answers everyone. i'll attempt to do a brief summary:

* it's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. water can still be used. a spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* it *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. but non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

* it's a concern for removing and storing the wreck. li-ion batteries can reignite after seemingly being extinguished and this can go on for days.

* vehicle manufacturers provide fire departments with safety information, for example diagrams of where not to cut a vehicle.",9

late august of 2017, it is to my belief, that i was drugged, raped & nearly strangled to death by two people i worked with. 

upon escaping the apartment i was in, i had to find someone in the complex to call 911 for me. the two people in question fled the scene, & the local pd took 20 minutes to arrive.* 

    *i awoke completely nude, groggy. i quickly found my clothes & got dressed. i heard the shower running, & i noticed white powder around the cup of hot choc. i had been drinking. i light a cigarette & grab my phone. the female in question comes out of the bedroom, & asks what i'm doing. i tell her i'm leaving, that i don't care what happened & that i just want to leave & go home. she makes a slick move for my car keys & i'm like ?? i'm just trying to leave dude. i turned around to grab my phone purse & she jumped onto my back & began strangling me. she puts me on the ground & i go in & out of consciousness. i literally thought i was going to die, i'm crying ""why me, why me"" saying my hail marys... i catch a moment to breathe & my fight/flight kicks in. i take my cig & burn her arm & face.. she released & i turned over & grabbed my purse.. pulled out pepper spray & sprayed her. i kicked her & took off running with my purse out her apartment door. i'm screaming, ""help call 911!"" ... it took me forever to get someone to come out & call 911. i was bare foot, in a flannel w no bra & panties w some cloth shorts...


i was transported to a local hospital where i waited an hour & a half for a sane nurse. i was told she was on her way(aprox. 45 mins-90 mins) but i had a panic attack/existential crisis & requested i be taken back to my car. *

  * the two people took off in the mans car. they locked the apartment & therefore the police had to wait for a search warrant before entering the apartment to retrieve my phone & keys. after getting the warrant, they go in & my phone is gone but my keys are there. theres dildos, collars, drugs, blood & a bunch of other weird ass shit i dont wanna talk about. they inform the officer thats with me & thats when i decided to leave bc i needed to get ahold of my friends mom or someone. i was completely alone & estranged from my family.. i was 18 years old at this time.

once i get my keys & a way to contact my friends family, i go back to the hospital & wait 14 hours to do a rape kit. i completed but once the sane nurse left, i left. i didnt fully check out because it had been nearly 24 hours & i wanted to go back to my friends & shower & fucking sleep. 

the days following, i have no contact with my detective. a full statement is never taken from me, & the two people are still mia. i end having to quit my job bc coworkers hear about what has happened. they think im lying, even thothe two people in question are shady with criminal records. i phone my detective 5 days later asking for an update, to which he responds hes, ""been very busy withchild abuse & domestic violence cases."" & he would, ""do his best to try & prioritize my case"" i mentally shut down after this... i was 900$ in the hole with my phone being stolen & had 200$ to my name after having to leave my job. 

for months i hear nothing, i leave voicemails with the pd & det. & i get no response.. email inquires never go far & it was hard to get anything going. when i went to file restraining orders they didnt go thru because the charges had been dropped. the male cleared his name & claimed i was on a consensual, rape fantasy esque lesbian escapade. that he tried to pull the female off me & we got in a ""cat fight"" because, ""you know how crazy lesbians are."" (i am not a lesbian, & had a boyfriend at the time) i was under the impression the female was suppose to be my friend, not a romantic interest. 
the whole case is apparently dropped, i'm considered a washed up, lesbian drug addict & the dna is whatever.

today, october 1st of 2018, i received a voicemail from a det. at the pd claiming there was a hit on the male dna found near my peri anal, neck, & thighs.. & that they want to purse the case further....

"for telling my best friend ""are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?"" or did i say it in front of the wrong group of people?. some back story. i'm white, my best friend since middle school is a black dude named rob. i'm not a white guy who says ""i have lots of black friends"" because i don't, but rob and i have been thick as thieves since we went to jr nationals for wrestling. i literally love the guy like a brother.

we are in second semester of freshman year at our state university. since we both hope to apply to professional grad schools, we've been searching around for community service groups in order to make contacts, get experience and maybe even help the community. we both volunteered for a veterans service organization where we go around and make sure that elderly veterans have thier basic services covered and aren't living in a dirty house. so far it's been kind of a waste of time because everyone we check has thier shit together and seem to resent us as busy bodies. whatever, the leader of this group thinks she's saving the world and rob and i are gong to stick it out to spring break and then find something else.

so the group had this dinner on wednesday night at a restaurant and we went because, why not free food. i have no idea what robs deal was but i looked across the table and rob was cutting and eating his hamburger with a knife and fork. i about died laughing because it looked so ridiculous and i had no idea what he was doing and i've eaten meals with him thousands of times and i've never seen him do such a thing. it was hysterically funny.

so i looked at him and i said ""hey rob are you eating your burger with a fork because you don't like black people touching your food?""  rob literally laughed so hard that he coughed up the piece in had in his mouth. we say stuff like this to each other all the time. 

but the reaction from everyone else was the most ridiculous ""clutch the pearls"" shocked white people reaction you've ever seen. i may as well have shot rob in the face. i was scolded by the head of of the volunteer group in person, while literally every other person present came over to rob to make sure he was ""ok.""  i knew i fucked up but as we were leaving we got a huge laugh about it and rob told me that some of the cuter volunteer chicks might actually feel sorry for him enough to have sex with him. i thought it was over and done with.

well yesterday director lady sent out a group email talking about the ""horrors of racism"" and how words have power and how racism must be ripped out by its roots wherever we see it and at the end she said ""u/monsterof will be apologizing to the entire group at friday's meeting."" not apologizing to rob who my joke was directed towards...but apparently to the group of angry white peoples who were sleepless over the mean words (not directed at them) i said to my best friend ok the planet.

again, rob and i got a big laugh but i'm really pissed she said i would be apologizing when i hadn't even been consulted yet. i think i should just quit and leave her hanging. rob wants me to get up there and make a mockery of her apology but i don't even want to do that. 

not necessarily looking for advice because i have until 3 when the meeting starts, but am looking for am i the asshole or not?


edit: well group meeting came and went. they didn't want to allow rob into the meeting to hear the apology lest he have to hear the offending words again or some such absolute horseshit, rob's a pretty chill dude but i think that really bothered him. we didn't make a huge scene like i guess we could of, we both basically said ""no thank you"" and we'll take our services elsewhere. rob says hello...",3

then a mother and her 3 sons arrive, the youngest of whom apparently looked like he could be 11. mom sits herself at the nearby sitting area facing away from the sprinklers so she can play on her phone. the boys start roughhousing, wind up hitting one kid and almost hitting our daughter. the family of the kid who got hit don't notice and don't care, but my daughter is scared and runs to her dad. 

her dad, understandably upset, goes up to the mother and says, ""excuse me, your sons hit one kid and almost hit my daughter. could you watch your children?""

as the title says her response was, ""why don't you mind your own fucking business?""

"for being unsympathetic to a trans guy that's mad at being dominated by cis guys on the swim team?. using a throwaway. 

so, there's a ftm trans guy at my school, let's call him don (since i'm watching mad men, lol) who recently came out as trans. he says he isn't transitioning using harmone therapy or anything of the sort to transition. as a girl, he was a pretty good swimmer on the team who did the 100m. he switched over to the male team. the coach casually told him the competition might be a little stiff (not in a harsh or transphobic way, more just 'you might want to be aware/prepare yourself' way). don nodded along and said that's okay.

but the way he's been acting recently shows he thinks it's anything except fair. since our swim team is pretty competitive (we're won state just last year), his times for the 100m fell to near the bottom of the pack. and he's been whining about this, calling it unfair and saying he should get a handicap of some sort. 

i disagree with this, partially. i do agree that it's unfair that he has to swim with cis guys as a biological female not undergoing transition. but he decided to join the male team, knowing the competition would be stiff. i know it may be have been triggering for him to stay on the girls team, but it's a trade-off: if he wants to be on the male team, he can hardly expect to be given advantages over other guys. 

one time, after practice when don was complaining, i civilly shared my opinion. he got offended at this.

disclaimer: i have only been to one memorial/ funeral (i'm unsure if there's a distinction) and even so, we were only permitted to be there partially.  m grandfather's funeral was a fairly simple affair since he was cremated, and there wasn't much by way of memorial. just a simple table at the church with a few photos of him. this unpopular opinion is about the non-cremated dead

maybe i'm in the minourity here, but.. i've come to be very confused about funerals. i just don't get it. yes, respect the dead. give them some respect (to a point). don't be disrespectful, i agree.

but the whole process of a funeral? what even is the point of that? i understand if some people wish to pay respects to a body (even if it's just an empty shell now), but we waste so many resources on these... for lack of a better term, death ceremonies. we're spending tens of thousands of dollars on caskets! body preservations! suits, makeup and clothes!

... just to.. you know... shut the lid on the box and bury the damn thing completely, never to be seen or touched again. all of that preparation taken. all of that money spent. just to.. throw a corpse in a box and smother it in earth. large caskets, carefully carved, wood-stained and sanded/ smoothed... fancy pillow for the lifeless corpse to put its head on and making it seem 'bed-like'. the corpse actually having had people take the time to dress it, and cover it in makeup to hide the usual deathly pallor.we even have the body preserved!! but... literally -why-? we're going to see the dead body maybe... one last time and that's it.

to reiterate and be clear: i agree that we should to a point, give a modicum of respect for the dead. don't just toss a dead body naked in a ditch. but to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on a funeral, casket, and such? that just feels.. gaudy and incredibly wasteful. particularly when one realizes that you just spent all that money, just to literally have it buried under several feet of dirt (or mud, depending on if its rainy).",6
"my mom suddenly had a brain aneurysm friday and in a matter of 4 days went from fine to brain-dead today at 12:30 mtn. i'm 23, have a sister, and my dad died when we were young so her and i are 'in charge'. reddit, what the hell do i do?. she doesn't have a will, she was in the probationary period of her new job and didn't have health insurance. unsure about life insurance but i think she had it (just don't know for how much). yup i know how bad this is. also what would have been my dad's pension kicks in in like 4 years and i have no idea what to do for that.  
she has a house that was re-morgaged (haven't figured out how much is left yet), about 22,000 in retirement, not sure about money in checking/savings but i don't think it's a lot.  

she donates her organs tomorrow. i'm so lost as to where to go logistically from here. i'm the calm, analytical type and my sister is the rash, emotional type so at least one of us has a head on our shoulders right now but i still don't have any knowledge of situations like this?! please help. 


edited to add more detail  


edit 2: thanks so much everyone for your caring words and advice or experience. i haven't been able to check this very often because we're planning her service for tomorrow and as you can imagine i'm busy with all that entails. 


thank you so much for your words - i will read every single response after tomorrow once things calm down a little.  
i thought everyone would be glad to know she was able to donate both kidneys and her liver - giving the gift of life to three people like she gave it me and my sister. knowing that makes this whole thing a tiny bit easier",10

"warning regarding capital one 360. i'm writing to warn you about capital one 360. i also posted this warning in /r/mortgages. 

the short of it is that they lost our ""cash to close"" by wiring our money to the wrong bank.

my husband and i had the money that we'd saved for a down payment in a capital one 360 account. as our closing date approached, we were sure to do everything correctly. i even called capital one well in advance (over 10 days) to tell them that we would be transferring cash to close.

the day of the closing, **capital one wired our down payment of almost $20,000 to the entirely wrong bank** –and they didn't even figure out what they had done incorrectly until i pieced it together.

even though they admitted liability (in writing!) they refused to cover the cash to close. if i hadn't been able to take an emergency loan from my parents, we would have lost the house.

capitalone didn't even return the funds to us until i sent them a demand letter (after i'd spent several hours researching the relevant laws).

to ""make up"" for what they did, they offered to send a ""housewarming gift."" i still get sick to my stomach when i think about capital one.

stay far, far away. they acted with gross negligence and treated me and my husband like garbage.

***edit: just to clarify: 

(1) they didn't just key a digit or two incorrectly. they switched our wire transfer instructions with those of another customer. our money was sent to a valid (but incorrect) account.

(2) there was never an option within our account for us to key in the information. i called to give instructions, and then they insisted on written instructions on our attorney's letterhead (which he sent).

(3) they said that they destroyed the source documents shortly after they received them. this only compounded the problem.

(4) i understand that mistakes happen, but **the way that capital one chose to treat us following their mistake is worth a warning.**",10
"by having my son clean his room.. to start off this is my wife's story and  it happened at the beginning of the year. 

some back story we have 2 kids a 10 year old and a 2 year old. why 8 years apart well me and the mrs tried having a kid for 7 years before she became pregnant.  so the 10 year old helps out a lot and is a great kid. we are truly lucky to have this child. 

well at the beginning of the year the two year old had started to potty train him self. telling us he had to go potty and then going potty. so we get him some pull ups and start that phase. we also have a 3 bedroom home and the boys share a room (the 10 year olds idea not mine). 

cue the day of said fu. the 2 year old had been playing in their room just out of ear shot of the wife. she would check on him every few minutes just to make sure he was all right. well he comes to her and says (we think) mommie slim yucky. 

oh no my wife thinks and calls for the oldest. hey, oldest the 2 year old got into your slime can you clean it up for me while i make lunch. so the oldest goes into the room to clean it up and my wife picks up the two tear old to clean him up. it's at this time she sees the 2 year old doesn't have his pull up on, and after a few minutes my oldest calls out, ""mom! can slime go bad?"" she walks into the room to she my 10 year old trying to clean up a huge pile of runny poo that is all over the floor with his bare hands. 

so after a few screams and laughs from my wife she tells him to go take a hot shower and she cleans the mess her self. then let's him play on the switch for the rest of the day. 

tldr: 10 year old tries to clean up runny poo with hands thinking it was slime.

edit. holy shit ( no pun intended) this blew up. you guys have me in tears laughing on my lunch break. thanks so much. 

but to answer a question or statement i have gotten in dms. no my oldest doesn't baby sit but does help out around the house. keeping his toys picked up and out of reach of the little one. normally he does a great job. is just one of said responsibilities.

edit #2 got gold? thanks it means a lot. you guys have made my day. 

also my wife and kids did this diy slime thing and at one part you add food coloring to make it the color you want. my son made his brown. cause he added multiple colors. so when the little one runs in saying slime yucky it wasn't a weird thing and he has gotten into it  before. my oldest wasn't playing in it. he was trying to clean it up.  and the whole thing was over the span of a few minutes. so he wasn't in there for that long trying to clean it up. 

and i forget not everyone knows things. but if you google slime it should clear up confusion.",4
"fl transmission shop destroyed my girlfriends center console, and is completely outing her life in google reviews. my girlfriend took her car to this transmission shop to get it fixed and they ended up spending like $4k on a brand new transmission to be put in. 

two weeks later, the tranny started acting up again with the exact same issue so she took it back and when she came back to retrieve the car after it was repaired, she found her entire center console was destroyed. 

when she said something to the owner, he completely denied it and said they didn't do it, and it was completely destroyed and for sure wasn't like that before it was brought in. my girlfriend didn't want to get into a confrontation, so when he proceeded to call her a bitch for the accusations, she said fuck you and walked out and slammed the door.

the guy ended up chasing her out of the shop, screaming in her face which is when his wife came running out and got in between them. my girlfriend then got in the car, and left and called the cops. they sent an officer out there and he told her, if she wants the parts replaced, her best chance is to write a letter to the shop. like wtf. 

we then left 1 star google reviews, and less than 24 hours later, six or seven 5 star reviews popped up with the most generic reviews of the shop, and then at the end of the reviews, they would completely blast me and my girlfriend calling us dumb college kids and saying we were lying about the entire situation, even though there is photos of the center console attached to my girlfriends review.

one guy even said he was there while it happened and watched it go down, when it was just my gf and the owner! 

the weirdest thing that triggered me to post this, was that today we noticed another review. it's written like one of her friends wrote it, and they completely dropped every piece of information of her life, saying shes crazy because of certain things, so don't trust her reviews and that it's a really good place. it was weirdly specific, stating places she used to live 4 years ago and stuff about her father and step father. 

we have lived in this city for like 4 months, and havent met anyone that would know any of that information which is leading me to believe they hired a pi or maybe have connections to the cops in this city to pull all of that information. 

can anyone provide insight into what can legally be done, if anything at all?",2

"for calling my brothers girlfriend ""miss piggy"" for eating our food after we told her not too?. so last year my brother moved in with me and my roommate. when he moved in his girlfriend started spending a lot of time at our place. this isn't a problem as my roommates girl friend comes over too. here's the thing though. my brothers gf pretty much eats all our food. no matter who's it it she will eat it. me and roommate have told her multiple times to stop eating the food we buy and only eat the food brother buys but she ignores us and eats our food anyway.

&#x200b;

we have confronted her and my brother multiple times and told them she needs to stop but she just says ""tee hee, sorry but it's so good"" and he refuses to say anything about it. we both have tried to talk him into going to her house insted of bringing her over but he doesn't want too. it's gotten to the point where both of us are considering getting a second fridge to put a lock on. 

&#x200b;

well, we're both sick of it. brothers gf is a heavy girl and weight is a very touchy issue with her. well, recently both of us have taken to calling her miss piggy when she eats our food. if we ever see her eating our food or after she has we confront her and call her it. she hates it and has freaks out each time she hears us refer to her as it. honestly though, she still eats our food and so we kept doing it. 

&#x200b;

well, today when i got home from work his gf was there eating leftovers i had cooked last night. i told her ""wow, i love to come home to see miss piggy eating my leftovers that i was looking forward too."" before i started oinking at her. she broke down crying and ran out.  she's been calling my brother furiously since and is refusing to come here anymore because i'm an ""asshole"".

&#x200b;

am i? like, we asked her so much to stop and she didn't that i honestly just lost it. we all buy our own food and we have a rule never to touch each others stuff. she knows this and she still did it so i think she deserved it.",3

"18 and about to be homeless. i need financial advice on how to get a job, get myself back on track financially. (hk). update : i woke up this morning to a flurry of responses. i am taking my time to carefully read through and consider each piece of advice. people have suggested reconciling with my parents. i will wait for a week or so for things to calm down, and simultaneously show that i can be a responsible adult through my actions. thank you all for the amazing responses. this thread has been as much a source of comfort as it has been a great resource.

hey everyone. using my throwaway account because i don't want to be recognised by potential peers. 

i am an 18 year old student from hong kong. because of plagiarism, i will not graduate from high school. my parents, and rightfully so, have decided to kick me out of the house in six month's time. i am at a loss and completely regret my actions, but am ready to do whatever it takes to get myself back on track. i've got a few questions. 

1. how do i find a job? i have no qualifications except for a high school education (of which i did not graduate), so i'm referring to low-pay jobs like janitorial work perhaps.

2. where can i find a place to live? this isn't a plea for someone to take me in. rather, does anyone know of a way to acquire cheap shelter.

3. how am i supposed to set up a bank account, manage money etc. my school never offered a course that gave advice on how to handle money. i know as much about this as a 12 year old would.

i understand that some of the questions i have posted may have answers online. i will be doing my own research whilst waiting for replies on this thread. additionally, the position i am in isn't the most common, so i thought it would be a better idea to post it on a forum like reddit where i could explain my circumstance.

i am not asking for pity, i deserve these consequences and understand i have to live with them. rather, i am looking to get on my feet.

thank you so much for any responses


edit : i refrained from stating the type of education i'd received, as i did not want to provide another opportunity to be identified. however, enough kind people have suggested looking for a transfer. i am not in a position to transfer schools because i received a private school education, and thus a transfer would mean having the financial means necessary to pay for the education. on another note, posting this thread has been a great decision. i've just been feeling lost for the whole day, but the advice given has shown that with enough work i can get back on my feet. thank you so much everyone.

"i don't want my twin sister in my wedding party and my mom can't handle it.. my twin sister and i have had a horrible relationship for the last 23 years of our life. the kind of relationship that people said ""oh you'll get over when you're older"". except i'm not over it. she physically and verbally abused me my entire life and continues to do so over trivial things now. 

when i was 18 i ended up moving 44 hours away from my family, but it was to get away from her. she's ruined most of my friendships and i just couldn't handle her anymore. after moving, her and i have been for the most part nc. when we do talk it's always for her to start a fight. either making me feel bad for not coming home for a holiday, or just something. 

most of my family understands our relationship but my mom, as she has for my entire life continues to be oblivious to it. ""oh it's not that bad"" or ""all siblings fight"". she's the kind of  mom you see in those movies saying ""my baby would never do that"", as the child is getting hauled away for murder ... yep that would be her.  i've been in therapy for the last 5 year to try and get over our relationship.

 but aside from the whole woe is me...

two months ago i got engaged to the most amazing person. and as one would, i called my parents, then called my older sister and finally i called my twin. hoping that she would be happy for me, or idk just something..... welp, she was not. she told me how selfish i was for getting engaged to a man who lived so far away and how she already knows i'm never going to come back home. how selfish that is to my mother and went on like that until i hung up about 30 minutes later. she told me that i should be ashamed for asking guests and my family to come to my wedding so far away. which i had already planned to offer at least half the cost of plane tickets. even more for my family.. but whatever. 


this month we have begun to plan the first details of the wedding. the guest maximum for the ceremony would be 100 and i think that's even more than i was thinking originally. as i'm really just wanting it to be close friends and family. we were planning to invite more people to the reception (is that normal? i've never been to a wedding before), people with kids and friends that i'm not as close to. 

we have decided that at most each of us would have 4 bridesmaids/groomsmen. i'm still trying to figure out who will be it as well. however, already i know that the last person i want to be my moh is my sister. i don't really even want her being in my bridal party. that decision has all but crushed my mother. she's really really upset about it. calling me names and telling me how selfish i am for not being able to let go of our childhood. 

i hate to see her upset. however i know that having my sister in one of those roles will for sure lead to fights and i really don't want to be judged for every decision i make. 

would it ruin my relationship with my sister forever if i don't have her in my wedding? i would like to have some sort of relationship one day. what can i do and how would i even tell her that she's not in the party without causing a fight

*** update****

thank you for the support everyone! it's been quite a busy couple of weeks for my fiance and i. i have decided not to have my sister in my party and invite her to the reception only. my fiance's groomsmen/ brothers understand the situation and will be playing security. i will keep you all updated as things progress. haven't yet talked to my mom about the decision.",7
"by wearing reflective glasses to a poker game. mandatory this didn't happen today, it happened saturday night.

so me and my friends have a saturday night poker game, and this time we decided to spice it up and play for money. we all brought in 100$ to  start. now this is where i fucked up. i bought these new pair of aviators that i really liked and made me look really cool. so i decided to wear them to the game, which was inside. i hoped it would improve my poker face, which is lacking. it was also sunset, and the sun was hurting my eyes as i was facing the window. i proceed to have the worst game of my life. they knew exactly when to call my bluff and when to fold. it was like magic, i couldn't get it. i went out super quickly. they continued playing until the end, and as we were leaving i told my friends ""you guys have balls of steel!"" my friends started laughing like crazy, and i asked them what gives. they said, ""you know those glasses are reflective, right?"" and i realize they could see every hand i had through my glasses. they laughed and handed me 50$ as compensation.

"by asking my wife to initiate sex. this just happened a few days ago. i've told my wife that i wished she would initiate sex more often, and last thursday she decided to oblige. i was sitting on the couch watching tv when she came out of the bedroom looking sexy the way she does. she grabbed my hands and pulled me up and started kissing me, taking a few steps back towards the doorway to go to the bedroom. we stopped a little and started undressing each other, and when it was my turn to get her pants off i dropped down real quick to get them off asap.

the next thing i felt wasn't joy in getting my wife naked, but searing pain! it turns out that i was too close to the corner of an endtable. i immediately stood up and clenched my cheeks while my wife, god bless her soul, was laughing hysterically trying to squeeze out the words, ""you took off part of your butt!""  

i ended up leaving a nice sized chunk of skin on the corner of the table. fortunately it missed my poop chute, but i have a nice inch or so long gouge near my butt bone. that hurts, in addition to the bruising of the buttocks from hitting the table so hard. my wife continued to be double\-over laughing while i was trying to stick kleenex in my crack to stop the bleeding. 4 days later and showers still suck, and i need to be careful when i'm sitting down.

tl;dr asked my wife to initiate sex, ended up taking off part of my butt on a table",4

"lpt - have a look at a map of the area you live in. pick 52 spots you've never visited, or are not familiar with. write them down on individual scraps of paper, and drop them in a hat/nag/whatever. commit to going to a random spot every week for a year.. this works if you're alone, with a partner, a friend, dog, etc.   you'll get a new appreciation for your city, and you'll get some exercise.   the wife and i started this   a few weeks ago, and it's been awesome.

*edit* for aditional ideas.  what i did when i set this up was to pick 26 nature type places, and 26 commercial ones.  so depending on our mood and the weather we dip into the relevant hat and off we go.  all you need is a pair of shoes, and  raincoat or umbrella for wet days.  a camera is awesome too.  outside is beautiful if you're out for a stroll and keep your eyes away from your phone.

there are are 2 groups of very hesitant people in the comments. the 'my city is too dangerous' group and the 'my area is too boring' group.  please don't put yourselves in danger.  the areas you pick should obviously be relatively safe.  and i realize density of 'interesting' spots will vary.  the spots you pick don't need to stand out as interesting though.   just spots you haven't really explored, other than mindlessly passing through.  
here's what i'm getting at.  you may have walked down a street a bunch of times on your way to x, y, or z.   when you did that you were on a mission, and likely didn't take in your surroundings.   go without a specific end point in mind, and with a sense of curiosity.   curiosity is the key.

here's how i picked spots.  used google maps on map view.  i looked for green areas, and zoomed in a bit to make sure they weren't private, then maybe switched to see if there were trees, or just fields, any water features, etc before deciding to add them.  then i looked for yellow stretches along roads that denote commercial areas.  and added those.   commercial areas are great, especially in quieter, or run down neighborhoods because you get mom 'n pop type places and never know what interesting things or people you might run into.   

*alright, another edit*
lots of people are suggesting geocaching, or pokemon go.  both are fun, and a great way to get off the  couch.  so is running, and strenuous hiking.  i think this is different because there is no specific thing to look for, or destination to reach.  we stroll to get a little air, and to give ourselves a chance to observe, interact with, and appreciate the details in our surroundings.

"can't believe i was so stupid, got scammed out of 1000$.  just made a  account to write this, i haven't been feeling well these past few days, i'm trying to be a bit vague about what happened because i haven't told anyone else yet (aside from the cops).

 i'm usually doing all my online payments throw paypal, i don't know what the fuck was wrong with me this time and pushed me to do it through banking transfer (at my bank) .

 how it happened : a few weeks ago i make a online post on a website about looking for a place to rent   , a few days after i get a phone message from a person saying that he has a place for a xxx$ price (the price was kinda low and was the first signal that i ignored, though i've seen similar priced apartments online but very few) and gives me a mail address for more info about the apartment . i mail him that and by the evening he sends me the info and a few  photos, all looks great and i'm excited, he also says that he only rents through airbnb, and i'm like sure (i've never used it before , so i go and make a account). then he sends me the ""airbnb"" link using bitly , i've seen people using it online to shorten links before and don't think much about it, i see airbnb in the link the page looks legit, especially since i've never used airbnb before. 

 i go to the payment options and since i didn't have enough on my credit card i use the banking transfer option (it was to a different country: ireland) , get 4 pages everything looks alright (have to stress again that i never used airbnb before) , didn't even notice that it was arnb ats instead of air bnb above iban, and next day i make the payment, the i send a scanned copy of the payment to the fake airbnb mail address, after getting the ""confirmation"" the owner of the place says that he will come friday with the keys.

thursday i get a mail with the time when we should meet, then friday comes and i get a mail that he can't come and if i can wait until monday if not i can ask for my money back (his excuse was another red flag that i ignored and chose to believe). i reply that i can wait until monday, monday comes and he tells me that he can't come and i should ask for a refund. i mail again to the fake air bnb support account and they say i'll get my money back in 24-48 h, as the days pass and i'm not seeing my money back i'm starting to do research in to scams regarding airbnb, then i go to my bank and they tell me they can't do anything and if the money are not back soon after the 48h i should go to the police.

 by this point i should be drowning in red flags, i downloaded the airbnb app and there were no payments, i logged in the account and there were no payments made, but i still chose to believe that everything will be fine. even after going to the police and being told that i got fucked, i still believed until today when i saw the fake airbnb page disappeared.

 the police told me that they are gonna try, but since the payment was done to a bank in another country , their hands are tied and won't be able to do much, i'm 99.9% sure that i won't get my money back.

 the past few days have been really awful : couldn't sleep properly , couldn't eat ... i just don't know how to deal with this anymore, i haven't told anyone yet and i'm to afraid to do so, i just feel everything is gonna break in to pieces when it gets out...
 
tl;dr: got scammed with a fake airbnb page, made a banking transfer to another country, went to the police and they told me i'm fucked.
 
 edit 10/03 : thanks for support, you don't know how much this means to me , i don't have many friends, so i don't really have anyone to talk with . i saw many suggestions and will try to do everything possible to help me get my money back (i'm just trying to not raise my hopes up) , when i said i spoke with police i meant with the unit specialized in fraud cases, i will go again monday to them and to the bank, i will also try to contact the bank in ireland and the anti fraud unit there.

anyway thanks for everyone's advice. you guys are the best and i appreciate all the messages i got. i will not waste anymore time on her

tbh i am a very passionate guy, i would never cheat on a girl or mistreat her. when i make a girl my girlfriend, like another comment said, that means she's a potential wife. i don't take that shit lightly. i love intensely and with all my heart, as cheesy as it sounds. and i'm sure a girl is out there who wants a guy who is obsessed with the relationship like i am lol. if i love a girl, i am all hers but i refuse to be disrespected and stepped on like what the fuck. spending the night at some random jersey shore pauly d lookin ass guy's bed and then crying to my mf mother that i dumped her for no reason?? that shit was embarrassing, my fucking dog got in the middle and was staring like ""wtf some shit is going on, i have to see this."" got damn. first of all i would never even go on a vacation without my girlfriend, what's the point. that shit is boring. drinking and dancing at a club and then going to an empty hotel room alone while everyone else is hooking up , how the fuck is that even fun, i'd need my girl there to have some fun with. that's like torture, not a vacation. idk anyway i'm fucking over it

"boyfriend (21m) sent me porn to learn how to be better at sex.... so today  we were going to have sex and i got on top of him and he told me he'd go on top. i was confused and asked him why, since that was his favorite. so he just randomly says that honestly i'm not good at it. yeah... at that point, i was not into it anymore and just wanted him to explain what he meant.

he said i'm too slow and i should go really fast and i should also put on a show for him because it's more fun that way.

i just told him i didn't wanna do anything anymore. i'll be honest, i cried in the bathroom for an hour. it was actually so embarrassing being told that...

then, he sent me some videos saying ""this is what i meant. see how they're flipping their hair and look good.""

he's such an ass and he thinks he's being nice by educating me on what he likes so i can be better next time. and those videos involved some serious core strength that i don't have

tl;dr boyfriend basically told me my username 

edit: damn this really blew up, didn't expect that. i was just looking for a bit of a comforting virtual hug. thank you to all the comments, everyone is so overwhelmingly nice",7
"update for not wanting my fiancee to dance to a love song dedicated to her late fiance at our wedding?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/aoadwq/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiancee_to_dance_to_a/

two months ago, i married the love of my life. i was thinking about this thread the other day, how it went, and where my head was at when i made it, and i thought you guys might like an update.

a little anticlimactically, the thing i was stressing about was a bit of a miscommunication, which probably happens a lot here. kayla wanted to dance with her late fiance's (i'll go ahead and just call him luke from now on) father at our wedding, and vanilla twilight was an example of a song along the lines of what she wanted, not the set-in-stone top choice like i had thought. i (and a lot of commenters in the original thread) spent a lot of time over-analyzing the lyrics to that song looking for hidden meaning in every word, while it turns out she hadn't put much more thought into the suggestion than ""this is a kind of sad song that i like.""

we got together that night and she had made several playlists of possible first dance songs for us, songs for when she walks down the aisle, music to play at the reception, and song choices for her dance with luke's father. we spent hours listening to them all and talking about the wedding. we even made a tournament-style bracket for our first dance song in her journal and put songs head to head against each other until the victor emerged. and at the end, we talked about the wedding and our relationship, luke and their relationship, and grief, what it was like when she lost him and what it was like for me when i lost my mom at a young age, what a family is, and all the things we're hopeful for for the future. we stayed up until three in the morning just talking and planning and laughing and crying a little, and i'm so glad for it. after getting bombarded by dozens of different opinions from dozens of different people earlier that day, i had been worried that i was going to have a conflict with my fiancee shortly before our wedding. but there was no conflict, just a pure memory.

after that night, i starting putting in more effort to be involved with the wedding planning process and actually ask for the things i wanted, which kayla actually really appreciated. we also took a long weekend a couple of weeks before the wedding to go on a camping trip together for just the two of us, which i highly recommend to anyone who is getting married. overall, there was a complete flip in my feelings leading up to the wedding from being somewhat insecure and excited but nervous to being completely at ease, excited, and feeling stronger about my relationship than ever.

the wedding day itself was really wonderful and worth the wait. kayla and luke's father had their dance to lean on me, and i also had a dance with kayla's mom and it was very emotional in a good way. i really felt that the day was a celebration of our love, and i was genuinely happy that luke's parents were there to celebrate along with us because they are very much members of our family and i wish i had the space to describe all the ways they've been there for us through the years.

my amazing wife is who she is because of all the experiences that she has had in her life, and i don't want to be the kind of man who asks her to pretend that she has never loved before me or pretend that her grief is something that is or should be done with forever now that she has me. i just want to say how glad i am that we shared that night together and that the wedding was nothing but love and celebration. i never thought i could be so happy.",3

"when i was 6, i killed my baby brother. when i was 6, he was on the kitchen counter and my mom went to the other room and i pushed him down. i didn't hate him, i didn't dislike him, i just remember doing it. he hit his head and ended up dying. everyone thought that he fell. my mom became a different person, she blamed herself, dad blamed her. lots of screaming and fighting until divorce. because of my actions i grew up without a father, a brother, and a mom who spiralled out of control with depression. the worst part is i never got to have a brother. i grew up alone without many friends and i always kept it inside me. even now, as an adult, every day i feel a purposeless loneliness. now that the holidays are coming up, it's the time of year i always think what life would have been like and it is a whole alternate universe. i hope that my brother would forgive me for robbing him of a life and if my parents would know they would forgive me for ruining their lives, but i'll never know.

"i like the sensation of finding a hair in my food while i'm chewing.. i love the sensation of of pulling the long hair out slowly, as it moves through my food, caressing my tongue and the sides of my mouth, then it slides through my pursed lips for what feels like an hour.

what really makes my day is when i'm in the middle of swallowing, and i can feel the hair stretch from my tongue to my esophagus, and i take my time pulling it out, savoring every inch.

but this whole experience is blown if i know before hand there's a hair. it needs to surprise me as i'm chewing.",6
"for admitting to my boyfriend that i think he's bad in bed?.  i did not bring this up but when ""what makes someone good in bed"" came up in conversation, my boyfriend asked me point-blank if i think he's good in bed, and i said no. he's angry because it's not his fault i don't get off, which is true. i can't get off just from piv sex, and he doesn't like the things that do get me off (oral, kissing, foreplay). 

i've told him twice now, politely, that i'm unsatisfied and i'd like him to do x, y, and z to fix that (initiate, show some passion/lust, occasionally offer to do the things that might help me get off, like play with me with a toy). he agrees he knows how to please me, he just doesn't make the effort because he doesn't get anything out of it. so i said ""well yeah that's literally the definition of 'bad in bed'"". he got angry and said it's my job to ""make"" him do those things. i said ""well i can't enjoy it if i have to force you, that's not sexy at all"" and he got huffy and left. 

obviously i'm very grateful that he's wants to sleep with me at all (i dated my last boyfriend for five years and he really only wanted it once every month or two), but i don't think that that alone makes someone ""good in bed"". i put a ton of effort into my appearance/fitness, i show initiative and enjoyment in our sex life, i compliment him and make him feel sexy…he does none of those things. otherwise our relationship is good though, so of course i'd never tank it over this. was i supposed to just lie to my boyfriend? am i the asshole here?",3
"my(23f) sister(25f) and friends(20s) talked about how i'm not good enough for my boyfriend(25m). they don't know i heard and i don't know what to do. firstly, my sister and this group of friends are what i would consider my closest friends. i love this girls to death. i literally tried to donate a kidney for one of them. i am 100% heart broken

my bf is an amazing guy, kind, funny, smart as hell and pretty much a model. he's just gorgeous. and asexual.

this isn't a problem to me and we worked it out. he's also very open to it and everyone knows(which i entirely support!).

we were supposed to hang out a week ago but after spending about half an hour his job called him and he had to leave. this didn't bother me a lot bc i had a killer headache and went home.

my sister and i share an ap. to save money and we have a year long lease so i guess i'm screwed.

long story short, i closed my door, didn't light up and got a nap. next thing i know i wake up to my sister voice. she and those friends were at our house(from what i heard they were going to a club and were drinking a bit/waiting for the others).


i didn't get up bc i was lazy and would have to put pants. then they started talking about me. i'm not proud but i was curious.

they were talking aboyt how they couldn't believe i was dating my bf, how he was too good for me, how i was too ugly to get a guy like him. my sister then started telling how being asexual is obviously a excuse to not have sex with me.

i'm not pretty and while it does makes me insecure i know i have other good characteristics but it was very hard hearing that.

they also made fun of my learning disability(they calle the r-word, which i can't even fucking write it). that i wasn't even financially stable, made fun of my job. they said i had to beg to be fucked.

all of my friends laughed and all of them shit talked me. i was crying pretty hard at that point. they left and i didn't know what to do.

i went to bed and basically made myself scarce this week. i get up earlier, get home later or stay at my bf. i have answered their messages but was somewhat cold.

i know i have to talk with them, even if it's to just cut off contact but i can't open my mouth right now. i feel so ashamed and sad.

my bf is also worried but i can't get what they said from my head. i know it's not true and my bf *is* asexual but i feel like i'm not worth being with him.

my sister is my best friend. i fucking told her how i feel too ugly and stupid to be with him. i showed her our messages and we spoke about his asexuality. i love her so much it hurts. i can't stand looking at her knowing she was saying those on my back, and that none of my friends said anything.

i just don't know what to do. i could break my lease, i guess(even tho it would be very expensive) but i don't know how to say why i'm doing it or how i can face them. i don't know if i should tell my bf.

tl;dr: my sister and friends mocked me for not being good enough for my bf. they don't know i heard them and i don't know what to do

i'm trying to respond to all the comments but if i haven't please know i have read it and and considered!

i promise i will talk with my boyfriend tomorrow, we are going to his place and i'll probably just show him this post

"long fake nails (in my opinion) are not pretty or sexy.. the long acrilic nails that obstruct daily functions for fashion, in my opinion are ugly. never once have i every thought ""i wish my girl had bright vilocirapter talons"" and i don't really get why other people like them.
 it also does help that most people i see with long fake nails are ""thots"".
now i just what to say i'm not against long nails in fact my nails are quite long for a male, i think nails should get maybe at most half of a centimeter.

"my mom is in hospital and my brothers took her dog to the animal shelter.. my mom is in the hospital with a broken hip. she is due to be released this week. my brothers dropped off her 15 year old yorkie at the animal shelter on their way out of town yesterday. they are going to the cottage and didn't want the hassle of her dog.  today i'm going to try and get him out of the shelter. i really hate them.

edit: thank you all! it was a big help being reminded  that i'm not wrong or crazy being so upset at my brothers for doing this. to give you an update - the shelter considered it a 'change of mind' and released my mom's dog to me without further paperwork. he's had a really hard time, poor guy! he's deaf and a little senile so his one night at the shelter was not good. i'm going to keep him here with me for now and keep a close eye on my dogs when they are together. he's just not doing well enough for another change. 
as for my brothers... i was almost at the point of stroke this morning because i was so upset thinking about what they'd done. i don't want to think about it anymore because it's not helping me or my mom when i get this upset. so, screw them! i'm going to watch out for my mom and do what i need to do so that she is treated right.",11

"by treating my horse like a dog. technically, my fuck up was last night. let me start by saying, i rent a beautiful home in the country on 200 acres of land. i have a horse, dog, and 3 cats. my horse lives in a field in my backyard. 6 acres of beautiful grass, hills, a stream, and a huge 20x10ft stall, all properly fenced.

last week, my horse bruised his foot and was limping. i decided to put up a temporary fence in my yard and keep my lame horse in my backyard where the ground is soft and the grass is greener. he could barely walk so there was really no concern over him escaping. he was beyond over joyed.

yesterday, i had the ferrier come and fix his shoes as he was no longer limping. here's where the fuck up  begins. i loved having my horse in the backyard. it was like having a giant dog hanging out with me. so i figured, what's the harm in one more night?

6 am, my phone is ringing. it's my landlord. there are 12 state trooper at my house trying to wrangle my horse who is leisurely strolling down the main road. he was fine, they had fun, my horse made friends with a super sweet lady trooper who was giggling the whole time she was walking him back home while he was nuzzling her face.

not nearly the worst of fuck ups but i thought everyone might enjoy something that doesn't involve sex.

tldr: treated my horse like a dog for a week while he was injured, only to have him escape when he felt better, causing a closed road and a bunch of state troopers a fun morning playing cowboy.

"for demanding that my 15 year old son's girlfriend get a paternity test for their alleged baby.. one more edit: wow this got big. so we've been doing a lot of research over night (obviously i haven't slept well) and found how non invasive the procedure could be, and the results come back in a week or so. we're gonna go to the girls parents with this information and try to explain why it's important for all of us to know. thank you all for your input, i'll try and post an update when i know more. also, as a side note, i wouldn't consider myself overly controlling or a ""helicopter parent"". as i said, my son knows about safe sex, knows sex is normal, and has even asked my husband for condoms in the past, as we told him he should do whenever he needed to. the constant supervision we kept them under only applies to what happens in our house, and i don't think that's an outlandish rule. just because we're sex positive doesn't mean we're celebratory or encouraging of it. 

it's almost comical that this of all things would be what made me get a reddit account, even more comical that i'm turning to the internet for input, but i just wanna put it out there that i'm set in my thinking. i just wanna know if i'm an asshole for it. 

my 15 year old son came to my husband and i last week, telling us that his girlfriend is 7 months pregnant. as someone who became a mother very young, i am devastated and so deeply disappointed. they've been together for about a year, but we always thought it was a kids thing, nothing harmless. regardless, when under our watch, we kept them under constant supervision, so this was all a shock. we know the girls parents and believed we were all on the same page about our kids. 

turns out we were wrong. when we called them, they spun some bullshit about how their daughter had already told us, basically placing the blame on their child for us not knowing she's been pregnant for seven months. on top of this, they've only known for about a month or two meaning she's had basically no prenatal care. 

we were trying to figure out what our next steps should be, so i called my older brother. not wanting him to keep a secret from his family, i told him i'd individually call his wife and two daughters to tell them myself. when i called the youngest one, 16, who is close to my son, her first reaction was ""i wonder if it's even his.""

upon hearing this, i immediately questioned my son, who then informed me of their very... colorful relationship. she's apparently a serial cheater, even though i didn't even think that was a factor in a 15yo's relationship. i've never felt like such a bad mother listening to all that was going on in my sons life that i didn't know about, knowing he's never trusted me enough 

after this i contacted the parents of his girlfriend, and as gently as i could, informed them that we wanted a paternity test done. they flipped, they were pissed about what i was accusing their daughter of, and saying the trauma of even bringing that up to her is too much for a heavily pregnant child. while i might agree, this is my child's life that's gonna be deeply impacted too. 

so my husband and i decided we're gonna keep trying to get a paternity test done no matter what it takes. for demanding this? am i being unreasonable? as bad of a parent as i feel like i am right now for letting this happen, i feel i'm no where near as bad as the girls parents...

edit: just to clarify, weve gone over this with my son and he's on board and understands why a paternity test is important.

another edit: we have definitely discussed safe sex with our son, as i said i was a very young mother and it was important to me to make sure they're educated. i in no way blame the girl, i just want to protect my son.",3
"by explaining to my 9 year old what prostitution is. so this happened yesterday. wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. i decided to let my 9 year old watch the original dukes of hazzard tv show lastnight. it was genuine, as he has a couple die cast general lee's and he seemed real interested in watching it. adult me thought "" heck yeah, i'm totally winning as a dad right now"". so, episode one, only a few minutes in boss hog and roscoe are talking, and the word prostitution comes up, thankfully it's subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. in that instant i saw the look of curious cross his face and i immediately ,in my mind was saying ""oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit"" as i was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says ""dad, what's prostitution?"" to which i responded ""oh, it's just a form of business that some people choose to do""....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. son looks at mother and says ""mom, i think when i get older i want to get into prostitution"" my face flushed red and i could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. now, if i am to correct this, i will need to explain a:sex and b:sex for money to my son. the only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.

"i pretended to be gay so i wouldnt get arrested. no regrets alright so my town has a super strict curfew. (i live in arizona which doesnt use daylight savings time which means the sun comes up earlier than in other places) and me and my homie were out one night from like 9pm to about 5am when the sun started to come up. we were at a park just chillin and a cop comes up. (we were 15 at the time) the cop walks up to us and starts to ask us what we were doing out so late. 

without another thought i make my voice go as high as possible and say. ""im sorry officer for being out so early but you'll never believe it! todays me and his 3 month anniversary! he just came to my house a half hour ago and woke me up so we can watch the sunrise together! hes just the perfect boyfriend isnt he!"" i then proceeded to hug my friend all tight and the cop just looked at us and said ok and without another word he went back to his car and drove away with the weirdest look on his face. 

my friend then punched me as hard as he could and we both swore to never tell anyone. ",12

"for telling my brother-in-law that he ruined me and my husband's wedding night?. a bit of backstory, my husband's brother (we'll call him tony) is the youngest in their sibling trio. tony is 29 and got married about 3 years ago. when tony married his wife, before my now husband and i met, my husband (larry) did a little ""prank"" on tony's wedding night. larry got some of that washable car window paint and wrote ""just married"" on the back and put balloons under a tarp in the bed of the trunk to be lifted. larry also placed a few boxes of condoms in the truck to be funny. i've seen pictures of this myself, if i can find them, i will attach them in an edit. 

flash forward to my husband and i's wedding night, as we were returning to my husbands truck, we noticed tony did a ""prank"" of his own. he covered my husbands truck in pink washable paint, put personal lubricant all over the outside and stuck feminine hygiene products all over it. he also threw condoms out of the package inside the truck, threw glitter on both the inside and the outside of the truck, and confetti. 

my husband and i were outraged, we saw this as going too far and also made my 11 year old daughter very uncomfortable. tony didn't see the problem and neither did the family, they all thought it was hilarious. we drove the truck back to the hotel and spent hours cleaning the inside. 

while we were cleaning, i called tony and very calmly explained to him that he upset larry and i and that we had to spend hours cleaning it. i also explained that the wash on the outside of the truck wasn't going to be cheap, to which tony said, ""use the money i gave you guys for your wedding present for that then."" which angered me more and i hung up on him. i did not cuss at him nor did i yell. 

after we spent nearly $50 cleaning the exterior of the truck, i got a very nasty call from tony in which he called me a b*tch, couldn't take a joke, and worst of all, felt bad for my daughter that i had an uptight woman like me as her mother. i didn't say anything back, i just hung up. 

the next day, i wake up to texts from his family saying that i was too harsh on tony, that tony drove 7hrs for our wedding, and he was just ""getting larry back"" for what happened at his wedding. larry told me that he actually deleted texts that tony sent me over night because he was ""embarrassed by what his brother said."" 

i refuse to talk to tony and so does my husband until we get an apology for what he did and said. i apologized to tony for perhaps being too harsh, which i admit, wasn't a genuine apology. but, i expected an apology back. instead i got more ""poor me"" from tony. larry &amp;amp; tony's parents texted me saying i need to ""stop creating drama"" and step back and think about how this makes tony feel. but, i think my ignoring tony is valid as what he said before was very hurtful. 

i've been called an asshole by tony himself. and i'm wondering if there's something here that i'm missing

aita?


**update: brother-in-law posted to facebook with a totally false story**

and here's what he posted(https://m.imgur.com/a/t6qglj8) 

so, i thought there were two photos according to my mother posted on facebook but it's just this one. that only shows the front of the truck before the vaseline/pink paint/rest of the sanitary products were added. brother-in-law posted that ""i tony welcomed op to the family with open arms and she cussed me out then insulted me!""

yeah, *i'm sorry, what?* i did **not** cuss him out nor did i insult him as my young daughter was around. he also added, ""op should get over herself as it wasn't even that bad."" yeah, good job cherry picking what you wanted everyone to see. only his wife, their sister, and their father saw the actual final product with us when we did. everyone else in the family, this is all their seeing and they now have the perspective that i cussed out *poor tony*. 

i asked larry what the deleted messages said and larry told me the gist of it was, ""op and her daughter will never really be apart of this family."" and larry said thats the less insulting way to put it. 

i'm sorry if this seems rude but i am very upset as tony just threw more gasoline at an already ignited flame. larry said that he's going to take care of it from here and that if i get involved more, tony is just going to make more lies up. 

anyway, i appreciate everyone's replies! a lot were very helpful, larry and i are definitely going to apply some of the advice given. i'm still refusing to speak to tony until he apologizes to what he said about myself and my daughter including embarrassing her when a condom fell on her in the truck. hopefully things work out soon! i don't want to start off my entrance to this family badly, either. thanks again!

edit: you can see one of the condoms in the truck actually and some of the streamers and glitter. it might not be high-res, sorry. there is two tampons and a pad visible in the photo.

edit 2: i'm sorry, i did not take any photos of the final product of the truck, i should've. i was still pretty fuming from everything else though, i didnt really think of it. i'm going to ask larry if he has any screenshots of the texts.",3

"should i call the cops on my parents?. so my parents are pretty shitty but definitely not the worst. they've been doing hard drugs since before i was born and have done so most of my life(i think they still are) causing us to move around a bunch (we now live in north carolina and originally in pennsylvania). and i understand that addiction is hard to overcome but i feel that since they have 3 kids they need to stop and become better people

 currently they live in a decent sized house but it's completely trashed. i mean there is literal garbage everywhere, tons of mice in every room, dog shit and piss in some places. the mice problem is so bad we can't really even have food in the house or else they will eat it and we don't have a working fridge so that's not an option either. we would get fed fast food once a day outside a school. i recently dropped out of school and moved to my brother's house(i'm 16 my brother is 20). and it wouldn't be my concern that they lived like that if it was just them but my 12 year old brother lives there and so do their two dogs. i just feel so bad for them and they don't deserve to be living in that house. 

my parents are completely neglectful to me and my brothers. they get drunk almost every night, they smoke weed and are possibly doing more drugs than that. we haven't been to any sort of doctors in 5 years because we don't have medical insurance for whatever reason. 

we have tons of family members but they live in a different state but any one of them would be happy to take my brother if absolutely necessary so i'm not worried about what would happen to him if the police were involved. i've tried calling cps several times but everytime that happens they let me parents know they're coming before hand and somehow make the place decent so they see nothing wrong with our living situation. 

so i guess i just want some people's opinions on if i should call the police

edit: i now have tons of pictures of what the house looks like 99% of the time. so i have actual proof of it. 

edit 2: i do plan on going back to school. i only dropped out because i have really bad depression and anxiety and couldn't deal with living at my parents and also the stress of keeping my grades up and having a social life

"for cussing out my in-laws for going through my luggage?. i recently got engaged and took some time off to visit our parents and start planning. first stop was mine and then his.

i suffer from chronic pain and take a variety of meds which cause a decrease in appetite and nausea. i haven't disclosed my illness to my in-laws, but a few nights ago i could hear her complaining about how i'm too good to eat what they cook. i let it go.

yesterday, fiance took me around his hometown. on the way back, he remembered to get beer, but we were already pulling into the driveway. i was tired, so he dropped me off. his parents were waiting for me in the living room, angry.

future mother-in-law - fmil: you really think you can pull the wool over our eyes, don't you? you think you can bring drugs into our house?!

me: *motioning to a seat because my legs hurt*

fmil: no no! you stand! how dare you bring this disgusting bullshit into our house!

i reach for my cellphone and she yells at me to keep my hands at my side.

fmil: i don't care how legal this stuff is. we don't allow this garbage in our house! *she pulls out a plastic wrapped package and i immediately know what it is.* my husband took a bite out of it and got sick! 

i'm pissed off right now because this was at the bottom of my luggage! and then she starts going off about how many pills i take (again, wouldn't know if you hadn't gone through my stuff) and how her son doesn't deserve a druggie. she takes my package and shows me where ffil took a few bites and threw up soon after.

it's been 10 minutes and my fiance is back. his mom asks him if he knows all the medication i'm on and how i brought pot into their house. he can't get a straight answer about how they know about my medicine, but then he glances at the package and just sighs.

fiance: mom, it's soap. even says african black soap.

he broke off a piece, headed to the kitchen, and washed his hands with it, showing them the lather. fmil fired back saying that she's never seen soap like that and that this doesn't explain the amount of meds i take. they say they're justified in what they did because they want the best for their son and since it's their house they can go through personal belongings at will.

i let them have it. i start screaming and cussing because i'm exhausted and tired. i can't remember everything i said, but my throat has been a mess from all of the screaming. ffil tried to give me back the soap, but i kind of threw it at him saying i didn't want his gum disease. terrible, i know.

we're staying at a hotel and not talking to his parents. i feel i could have gone about it better. i wanted a good relationship with my in-laws and we've always kind of gotten along... now i feel like i fucked up badly.

**tl;dr: future in-laws went through my luggage and mistook soap for an edible. i cussed them out and offended them and now i feel like i burned a major bridge.**

"several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community.... if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.

however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other.

the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

next, the pope waved his finger around his head.

 the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

the rabbi pulled out an apple.

with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. 

the jews could stay in italy!

later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened.

 the pope said, ""first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs. then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us. finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. he bested me at every move and i could not continue!""

meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won. 

""i don't have a clue!!!"" the rabbi said.

""first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger. then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here.""

""and then what?"" asked a woman.

 ""who knows!!"" said the rabbi. ""he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!""",0

"i(20f) opened up my boyfriends(22m) pandora's box and i heavily regret it. hello reddit, it's currently 4am and i can't find the will to sleep so excuse any typos and the format. 

i did something horrible and scummy, something that shows i'm insecure and have zero trust, nothing will excuse my actions but they weren't without reason. my boyfriend of almost a year, our anniversary is in less than two weeks, has been growing more and more distant. he hardly looks up while talking to me when we're at home and just stares at his phone half the time, he has told me he's cheated on every girl he's dated in the past and stayed pretty honest about that part of his life. 

despite his growing distant nature we have plenty of happy moments and haven't had any major arguments recently. though i've had a growing horrible gut feeling about a girl he has on snapchat. we are hardly intimate anymore and any attempt is typically ended by him halfway. after a couple of drinks and a growing insecurity of why i might not be good enough i snooped through his phone to check out his conversations between mentioned girl. 

it didn't take much effort, he's told me his passcode to get into his phone numerous times and i figured a quick peak couldn't do much harm. i know i should have talked to him like an actual adult and voiced my concerns but recently he's been lying a lot and lying super easily. typically about minor things like whether or not he's done any chores i've asked him to do around the house but it's scared me how easily he can lie to my face. either that or he would get extremely defensive or upset over the fact that i'm upset.

to wrap up this post though, what i found was horrible, heart shattering and has left me sick to my stomach. his conversations with her are filled with her telling him how much she loves him, how much she wants to be with him and extremely sexual conversations. he's returned all these feelings and seems just as crazy about her as she is for him. at one point in their earlier conversations he mentions how he's only with me because it covers half the rent. i woke him up with my crying but couldn't explain to him what was wrong. frankly i have no idea what to do or how to even go about talking to him about this. he hasn't physically cheated on me(at least to my knowledge) but they have talked about visiting one another or her moving in with him(if it wasn't for me of course). 

i'm sorry for the long rambling post but honestly what are my next steps how do i function after this and how would i even go about talking to him about this or if i'm better off dropping it and ignoring it forever. 

edit/update: wow, thank you all so so so much you have been kind and wonderful and even the critical comments are eye opening and appreciated. i know i shouldn't have thought i was special and i know i should have paid attention but when you love someone you don't want to see the bad and i would typically be called untrusting or over paranoid. i have a lot of anxiety/depression so he would typically use this as a way to try and dodge any suspicion or conversations about him talking to other girls. this morning i attempted to act normal and keep a brave face until i could talk to family/friends but i ended up getting sick to my stomach and breaking down. i told him what i saw, i really just wanted an explanation or maybe i just wanted to know why the fuck i wasn't enough despite constantly throwing money at him when he needed it and picking up slack with things fell short. i didn't get much out of that. he couldn't offer any words of comfort that didn't sound selfish or like utter bullshit. he's at work now so off i go to plan for my future. one that involves me being happy and safe because this situation will only offer heartbreak and more depression. again thank you so much, i'm crying but currently they're tears of happiness from all the support.

"by accidentally paying for a very unwanted happy ending. bit of backstory: i (21 m) got money for christmas from my parents with the expectation it would be for experiences (concerts, trips, parks, etc) rather than material things. i'm an incredibly non-confrontational and generally awkward guy. i know the story sounds kind of unlikely and all i can do is promise it's true and hopefully looking at it through that lens might make it a bit more believable. also this happened within the last 24 hours but not technically today.

so i decide to use a portion of the money to go and get a massage. i'm looking at the prices and most of them fall around $80-$100/hour, but in my cities chinatown the rates are much lower, many offering $50/hour. in the back of my head a flittering of ""happy endings"" appears but i figure i don't care if that's how they get a good portion of their money, i'm just in it for a massage. plus that's probably just locker room talk and doesn't happen much in real life. so i pick a place in chinatown pretty much by chance, just wherever opened earliest as i had plans to go after i got off from work (night shift).

i take the subway down and get off to walk the 5ish blocks to the place. it's raining pretty decently and it's unseasonably warm, feels like spring despite being mid january which puts me in a great mood. great way to go into this. i reach a certain street and realize i've gone too far. weird i didn't see the sign, whatever i'll just double back. get back to the street i originally turned off of onto this street and realize i must have missed it again. a quick google later and i got the exact address, it's about a block from me. finally find the place and realize why i missed it, there's no sign stating it's a massage place and no distinctive feature that would even prompt you to think it was open to the public. just a slate grey wall with a metal door and a small sign, about the size of my hand with the address on it. this is the first time i question whether i should just go to some other place, but the rain is starting to get through my light jacket and soak my clothes so whatever i go in. i land in a tiny little landing with a sign telling me to press the buzzer on the wall. i do and after a few seconds an elderly lady opens the door and motions me in. she speaks very little english but mentions how wet i am. i fumble through a quick introduction and she grabs a towel and hands it to me. i thank her and begin drying off, apparently not to her satisfaction as she takes the towel and begins to dry me off - a pretty uncomfortable experience. i look young for my age and she asks me how old i am. i say 21 and i can see the disbelief and note her drying me off is pretty belittling but i'm used to that kind of stuff so i brush it off. 

she leads me back to the massage room and i ask if i can use the restroom before it starts. she points me to a small restroom at the end of the hall. i'll spare that part but i notice there's listerine, tooth brushes, vaseline, etc. in the bathroom. by now i'm positive this place does happy ending type stuff but mostly unperturbed as i'm just looking for a massage. so i finish up and go back to the room and the elderly lady brings in my masseuse, a mid 30s lady wearing this horrendous lingerie. she speaks even less english than the elderly lady, like none at all. the elderly lady is talking to me but i can't figure out what she's trying to say. finally i realize she's asking for the money. i hand her $50 (the price she had mentioned when i called earlier) and she says ""plus tip one hundred"". i'm sort of taken aback like how are you gonna ask for a tip double the original price. i tell her i was told 50 over the phone, she is very insistent on the 100 tip. by this point i understand what's going down more or less and i just come out with it. i say ""i'm just looking for a massage, right, no"" and do the handjob motion. she makes no motion that she acknowledged me so i repeat the statement. she keeps pressuring me ""don't you think she deserve tip? why don't you want to give tip?"". being a pushover i cave and say ""i've got $100"" and offer that. after a little more arguing she agrees to that. at this point i figure $100 still isn't an absurd price for an hour massage. 

with the payment out of the way, they leave the room and tell me to strip. now i had gotten a massage once before and they had told me to strip and i did, only for her to return and tell me she didn't mean my underwear too so she left while i sheepishly put my underwear back on. this time i wasn't going to do the same thing. plus if there was any doubt, i hoped me keeping my underwear on would clarify i was just here for the massage. the masseuse comes back in and i'm laying on the bed with the towel over my back (what i had done last time i got a massage). she motions for me to stand back up so i do and she gives me a questioning look and motions pulling off my underwear. i, for the third time do the ""no handjob"" bit but she mentions a shower so i think maybe for hygiene reasons/ relaxation they expect you to shower first, hence the two towels so i wrap the one around me and follow her to the shower. i go in and to my (minor at this point) surprise she follows me in. pretty much before i can do anything she begins washing me and i'll admit it wasn't any more sexual than say a nurse washing someone and was pretty relaxing being showered so i just went with it and tried to get back into the mindset of relaxing. that finishes up and i follow her back into the original room. she motions for me to lie down and places the towel over my still naked back. finally the massage begins and it's actually pretty decent. this goes on for in what were for sure the best 10 minutes i spent there.

at one point the massage stops and i hear some ruffling so i open my eyes and turn my head to her taking her top off. i figure this is where i draw the line so i tell her ""no no no put your shirt back on i'm just here for the massage"" but she doesn't understand. i motion to pull her shirt back up and she seems completely unfazed. she goes over to a bottle of listerine and gargles it in her mouth. it is just about the most bizarre experience i've ever had so i'm going between just shock in watching it and panic of like ""i'm about to get arrested for soliciting a prostitute i didn't even want"". she literally comes over and pulls the towel up which at this point was just covering my junk and spits the listerine into her hands and begins to give me a handjob. at this point i'm at a crossroads, like i can either just let this happen or tell her to stop, but she doesn't seem to understand or care what i'm saying and i gently move to get up and she shushes me and like gently pushes me back down and starts making ridiculous, porn-level fake moaning noises. i come up with my brilliant escape plan. from her first touching my junk to now, only like 15 seconds had elapsed but in my mind it felt like a lot more had. i fake an orgasm which she entirely doesn't buy and i hardly even try to sell. she looks at me quizically and says ""ok...?"" and i say ""ok ok ok yes"" and finally am able to shoo her out. i wipe myself down with the towels to get the listerine off me, rush to get dressed and walk out of there. 

tl;dr: my parents give me money to go and get an accidental and entirely unwanted handjob in chinatown",4
"school has suspended my 3rd grader for saying the word 'gun'. - ny. yesterday i got a call from my 8 year old son's school, saying i had to immediately pick him up, but they did not say why. i rushed out of work to get him, and when i got to the school the vice principal had him in the office. i was told that my son was being suspended for a week, and would be mandated to see a social worker twice a week. when i asked what was going on, i was told that my son made threatening statements to another student during indoor recess, and it was overheard by the recess monitor and reported. my son was looking really upset at all this, but the vice principal said it was the rules and there was nothing that could be done. i then turned to my son and asked him what he said, and he told me he was flexing his arm muscles in the gym and said 'look at these guns!'.   


 apparently 'gun' is a trigger word that all staff have to report, no matter what the context, and an investigation has to occur before the student is allowed to return. the vice principal reiterated that it could be construed as a threatening statement and that school policy was that he would need to see a social worker twice a week during his recess period.

so before i get into the meat (heh) of things, i want to provide a little context first.


my girlfriend and i have been dating for about 6 months, and recently we've started to have sex for the first time ever. we're both our firsts. i'm a mixed black and white dork standing at 6'1 while she's a pale, short dork standing at 5'4. she's always been a bit shy but that's probably what attracts me to her the most. i really want her to open up to me about anything and everything. her interests, her anxieties, her desires, etc. i just want her to be honest with me while i do the same for her. i don't think either of us want to have some sort of surprise secret coming out of nowhere in the coming years, so it's best to be open early on. we're both looking for something long term and exclusive, likely to get married and settle, and possibly have a kid or two.


but there's one thing that's been bugging both of us lately.


keep in mind that neither of us have any sort of asian ancestry whatsoever. that's going to be important for later, probably.


about a month ago we played a fun, harmless game of truth or dare. we didn't do anything stupid, just talked about some of the interesting things that have happened in our lives so far. i asked her if she ever kissed a girl before. she said no but she did actually touch lips with a girl when she ran into her in elementary. good, my girlfriend is straight. we laughed it off, i called her a dopy little klutz, harmless fun and games, right? then the next question.


have you ever watched hentai?


now she's a big anime fan. me, not so much. i would consider myself a very basic anime fan. i grew up watching dbz and that's pretty much it. i've seen akira, cowboy bebop, fma:b, and a couple others on my own terms. but sometimes we watch anime together, and she's into some shit i've never heard of before. but again, it's all harmless and just for fun.


i told her yes, i have watched hentai before, but mostly as an experiment to see if i actually like it. i kinda did, kinda didn't. a lot of it is very rape-y and i like my porn to be more wholesome. i told her this and she says that she watches hentai semi-frequently. she told me she's glad that she was finally able to tell someone this. i'm glad that someone was me.


fast forward to a week ago.


we decided to bump bellies for the first time and it was absolutely amazing. we do a bunch of twists and turns and all is well. but then she hits me with this:


a ""yes, onii-chan!""


at that moment, i tried to internally solve this with advanced algebra and calculus and shit. by the time i solve the pythagorean theorem of this angle she's as red as a tomato. she realized what she just said and starts breaking down crying.

for the next half hour i get her to calm down and told her that it was completely okay. people let things slip during sex all the time, and it's nothing to be embarrassed about. harmless.


i take her home, tell her everything is going to be okay, and go about my night peacefully. she texts me the next day saying it won't happen ever again. great. we both agree that our first time didn't count since neither of us got our socks rocked off.


fast forward to last night.


we're rockin' and a-boppin' all night long, and again, it's fantastic. this time i got to ult and now it's her turn. i go to town down there and she hits me with another one of these:

""right there onii-chan.""


i unplug my lips from hers and what do i see again? another cherry tomato. at this point we're both visibly frustrated. i take her home again, but this time i don't get a text.


i've never known what onii-chan actually meant, just that it's used in hentai a lot, so i decided to look it up this morning. apparently it means ""older brother"" in japanese. so i'm connecting the dots and have come to the conclusion that she's watched so much hentai that it's started to affect our relationship. i don't want to leave her. she's cute, sweet, and we play switch together. no one plays switch with me.

my question now is, does she want tall, dark, and kinda handsome? or does she want onii-chan? does she want me to rp as her older brother, or does she want me to go 2d like paper mario?


tl;dr my gf has called me onii-chan twice now and it's looking like there's no end in sight. i am absolutely perplexed on what my next move should be. help me out please.

#edit: 

hey weebs and weebettes, it's me, op of this post. watching all of this unfold has been a real treat and i'm happy to say that me and my hello-kitty tank top gamer girlfriend are doing a lot better. all of the advice i've gotten on how to proceed has been really helpful and we talked about it pretty much all day yesterday.


i'm going to post an update either later today or tomorrow to fill you troglodytes in on the deets.

"askscience ama series: experts are warning that measles are becoming a global public health crises. we are a vaccinologist, a pediatrician and a primary care physician. ask us anything!. measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to doctors. it spreads through the air. particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. people are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. in 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the u.s. were vaccinated, according to the cdc.  the number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  the effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.

"by almost getting my dad in trouble for child porn. so this happened about 15 years ago when i was around 8 years old. its a memory that came back to me all of sudden and me realizing how fucked it really was.

my dad had a digital camera that me and my brother used to play with a lot. we took pictures of many different things around the house.

then an idea popped up in my head. idk why i thought this was a good idea but i decided to take a picture of my brother's, who is 7 at the time, butthole. like close up shots of my brother spreading his ass cheeks. multiple shots, different angles, i was doing a photoshoot on my brother's asshole. we were laughing a lot and having fun with it. 

i left the pictures in the camera and just forgot about it. few weeks later, my dad didnt look at what was inside the memory card. and went to costco to get the pictures printed. 

the people that handled the photos saw a close up photoshoot of my brother's asshole. there must have been atleast 10 photos from what i remembered. that shit was child pornography.

the good thing was nothing came out of it which is what i am most shocked about. my dad called us in the room to show us what we did. his reaction was ""what the hell is this!"" and ripped it to shreads. that was that. 

15 years later i realized how things could have turned bad for my dad if someone actually tried to do something that day.

tldr:  took pics of my bros butthole with a camera, my dad ,without knowing ,went to costco to print them, people that work at costco saw a photoshoot of my brothers asshole, dad didnt get in trouble thankfully.

edit: yes costco actually printed them out. i remember them being in a nice little paper envelope.

edit 2: i am surprised by how common kids are taking pictures of each other buttholes. still havent found my name yet in the comments. maybe i should just ask him about it. we are pretty close but its just really weird to bring up.

edit 3: now that i think about what would happen if i told my brother. its too fking awkward and cringey. ""hey remember that time i took pictures of your asshole?"" i will set the price at five platinums for me to tell him. why is it so high? cause i know yall wont be able to do it.

edit 4: what the actual fuck! i did the research, i looked at the top of all time of tifu. and all it had was 6 plats at most. it happened in less than 5 mins. oh god. im in class right now. ill update tonight. fuck me.

edit 5: tldr at the bottom. 

8 platinums is 8 platinums. during the whole class period i couldnt focus in class at all, because i was thinking of what would happen. these are the type of memories that stay in the back of your mind never to be mentioned ever again. 

as i was driving home, i thought how the fuck did it get to this point. it was only suppose to be a funny story i post and maybe get gold. it turned to a situation where now im about to tell my brother something so awkward and terrifying to me. 

i get home and go upstairs where my brothers at. i say ""sup"" and he tells me about class and other shit. im in my head the whole time like ""fuck its about happen"". i look at him laughing nervously. 

bro: what?!

me: haha oh god

bro: what?!

me: hey remember when--haha-when 

i was dying slowly inside couldnt even look him in the eye

me: remember when i-- hahaha-- took pictures of.... your asshole

bro: whaaaaat?! you did?!! hahaaha wtf are you talking about? 

me: you dont remember at all?

bro: noooooo! wtf??!! hahhaha

i reveal everything that happened and showed him the post, he was dying. i was also dying but on the inside with cringe and awkwardness.  he didnt even remember, now he will forever remember what i did to him. how the fuck did my brother's asshole get to the top post?

tldr: told my brother, lots of wtfs and lmaos, doesnt remember at all, my top post is about my bros asshole, he will remember this for the rest of his life. but hey 8 platinums is 8 platinums.",4

"i am sick of being reminded constantly how nobody cares about pedophilia.. i once argued with my father about bowie having raped a 15 year old girl, and it's incredible all the excuses he would try to find to excuse it or make it seem like it wasn't that big a deal at all. he actually told me at some point ""no, i am explaining things you don't yet understand to you"", and i am so enraged. my father thinks i'm a complete idiot. i've been abused by my grandfather my whole childhood before my mother finally decided to estrange my grandparents (for reasons unrelated, nobody in my family knows about my abuse). i've been living with this my whole life. i know what the fuck i'm talking about. 

and when i speak up about woody allen all i hear are excuses. i've had my boyfriend get upset at me for saying pedophiles should die. all i ever hear is excuses. how we must dissociate the artist from the art. how child porn is good, because that way the poor pedophiles can ""satisfy their urges"". how the pedophiles are suffering, they're so alienated from society, they're so in pain…

what about me? do i need to keep making myself tiny, silent, do i need to keep forcing myself to feel compassion for the people who broke me? do i need to keep praising the man on the screen while a traumatized woman who used to be a little girl he assaulted is breaking down in her home at the mere mention of his name in the media?

fuck you all. fuck you if you think you can make lolita out to be the greatest love story of the century, if you think we need to shut up and get over it, if you think we need to stay silent because some asshole's movie about a teacher dating his quasi-teenage student is more important than the very real pain of countless human beings, fuck you if you think you can get off to recreation of my abuse. i have nothing but contempt for you all.",11
"my 32 m best friend asked if i would be her 30 f sperm donor for her surrogate and i am in love with her but she has no idea.. so for a bit of background we met in college and have been best friends since then. we hooked up once years ago,it was a drunken exchange and i honestly chocked it up to we were both drunk and in the right place.

she got ovarian cancer that was stage three a few years back and survived and has been in remission however she had to have a complete hysterectomy. she had mentioned a year ago she was considering surrogacy. she had told me she planned to use a donor as she has been single for a while.

thing is i am in love with her and i have been for years but she has no idea. i know at one point she had feelings for me but i was seeing someone then and out of respect for my gf at the time she never acted on it. 

i feel like before i give her an answer which will be yes i should tell her how i feel. 

i want to make her dream of motherhood come true and i am honestly touched she thinks so highly of me she wants me to be the father. 

regardless of how she feels, i will still donate and if she doesn't still feel the same way i will love her as my best friend.

guess i am trying to find the best way to ask her and came to reddit for advice     

so how should i handle this?

"11 minutes. a cop was patrolling late at night in a well-known lover's spot, famous for all obscene activities. he sees a couple in a car, with the interior light brightly glowing.

the cop carefully approaches the car to get a closer look.
then he sees a young man behind the wheel, reading a computer magazine. he immediately notices a young woman in the rear seat, knitting. puzzled by this surprising situation, the cop walks to the car and gently raps on the driver's window.

the young man lowers his window. ""uh, yes, officer?""

the cop says: ""what are you doing?""

the young man says: ""well officer, i'm reading a magazine.""

pointing towards the young woman in the back seat the cop says: ""and her, what is she doing?""

the young man shrugs: ""sir, i believe she's knitting a pullover sweater.""

now, the cop is totally confused.. a young couple, alone, in a car, at night in a lover's lane… and nothing obscene is happening!

the cop asks: ""what's your age, young man?"" 

the young man says ""i'm 22, sir.""

"by eating the green paste. this happened yesterday. i got sushi with this girl after finally getting the courage to ask her out. (to those out there going through the struggle of feeling like you can't talk to someone you like, just do it. it's nowhere near as big a deal as you're thinking. don't be too proud to ask your friends for advice either.) 

anyway, this is the first time in years that i've had sushi. everything's going well as we're just talking about school until i'm so focused on what she's saying that i pick up the tasty-looking green paste with my chopsticks without any thought to what it is. 

after i throw it in my mouth and start chewing, she pauses and asks, ""did you just eat that whole thing of wasabi?"" 

i stop chewing as the spiciness kicks in, and i realize that i'm dumb as fuck. i figured it would've been gross if i just spit it out into a napkin right in-front of her so i keep chewing slowly instead. that doesn't help, so i grab the salmon with my sticks and start eating it along with the wasabi so that the taste isn't so bad. this doesn't help at all either and she can see me struggling to maintain.

""drink your tea."" she suggests.

""ah yes! liquids! they exist!"" i think to myself. 

after this only somewhat helps, i just smile, point towards the restroom, and nod my head in hopes that i at least look cute while dying on the inside. 

the door's fucking locked. 

after this i just swallow everything left, walk back to the table, and live with the flames inside my nose. the rest of the lunch was enjoyable though. will probably jokingly ask her if she wants to go for some wasabi next time.

tl;dr: wasabi. never again.

edit: i saw cars 2 once around the time it came out but hardly remembered any of it. i just watched the mater scene on youtube though and honestly i could still see myself making the same mistake had my memory of the movie been better. 

i also wanted to say many of the comments have been pretty informing as well as heartwarming. also, those of you who've tricked your family and friends into eating wasabi are straight up evil haha.",4

"i cosigned for my brother's car. he stopped making payments on it.. long story short, i helped him buy a used car 4 years ago on a 56m loan for $7700 @ $163/m payments. he made the payments on time religiously for ~~4 years and 4 months~~ 47 months (+2 i just paid), i went and counted the payments via credit karma(https://i.imgur.com/98eivrn.png) and it came out to 47 months not 4 years and 4 months.

then we had a falling out 2 months ago over nothing, but he refuses to talk to me and decided to say fuck it and stopped making the payments on the loan. he doesn't answer his phone when i call or text and after he moved out of my house he never gave me his updated address so i have no idea where he lives. 

so naturally the bank calls me letting me know it's 2 months over due. i paid it up to date on the spot. there is $1600 left on the loan which i'm going to pay off fairly quickly should he still continue to not answer my communication attempts to reach him over this. 

he was 2 months behind on the loan and i asked if this would be reported as 2 months late on my credit report and they said yes it would have one hit of 30-60 days late. 

is there anyway i can get that reduced or am i screwed on that? i would've paid the damn loan payments on time had i known he would just stop paying on it. 

kind of feel likes it's a bit unfair that i'm getting hit with a late payment alert on my credit report when they didn't even try and contact me until yesterday about it. 

any advice? 


edit: people seem to think i'm trying to get out of paying the loan. that's not the case, i understand the responsibility that i'm required to pay for it if my brother doesn't make the payments. i was asking if there was anyway to avoid this negatively affecting my credit history. 


big update: the loan officer called me back and said he talked to his bosses and they decided not to push out a late payment alert on my credit since i paid it up to date the moment i was notified that it was behind on the payments. so that's is a huge relief! still have to figure out if my brother will make payments on it going forward, but at least my credit won't be negatively affected.

"stage iv colon cancer at 31. not much to it. i'm 31 and dying. have lead a relatively healthy life. i eat ok - much better than most. i've been running three times a week and lifting weights 3 times a week since college.

i don't smoke. i don't drink much - maybe 3-4 beers on a friday and a little more on holidays like new years.

i just need to vent. i went to the doctor a year ago because i knew something was up. i was dismissed. didn't think much of it.

i went back a few months later - i was dismissed.... ""people my age don't get cancer, don't waste money on tests""

well, hah, it was cancer! pretty upset that multiple doctors tell me people my age don't get cancer when a quick google search shows a large increase in young people getting colon cancer - i get the doctors didn't get the memo? 

it's easy to be mad at the doctors but that is not really fair. there's no one really to be mad at. i kinda wished that i downed cheeseburgers and cigarettes and then at least i could blame myself.

it's all sh**. what a sh** life. had a crappy childhood. dad out of the picture, mom bouncing between boyfriends and constantly moving me around - never really had a chance to make friends.

from 18-28 i worked shit retail jobs, bars, restaurants, just making ends meet and surviving. on my 29th birthday i made a change and went to college. i was set to graduate with a cs degree in three years and finally start my life. well i guess that is not gonna happen.

i'd rather i got hit by a bus one day out of no where than live in this hell. no friends. no family. no money to do anything. gonna spend my last months smoking pot and playing with dogs at the shelter, then i'm gonna die a crappy death. kinda puts my other problems into perspective... ranted its a little late now.

thanks for reading. watch your health. don't let doctors convince you nothing is wrong (assuming you're not naturally a worry-wort). 

i don't think i ever went to the doctor in my adult life, i always ""waited it out"" and new i was fine. then when i knew something was wrong, i should of had more confidence in myself in knowing that.

"update i haven't seen or heard from my biological father in 21 years, and i received a phone call saying that they need the next of kin to make decisions.. so i wanted to thank everyone who commented and replied on the previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8azu76/i_havent_seen_or_heard_from_my_biological_father/?ref=share&ref_source=link) as it really helped me feel better about the decision to relinquish my rights as his power of attorney.

on sunday, my aunt had called to let me know that when she visited him and asked if he wanted to see his children, and he tried to open his eyes and blinked several times so she insinuated that it was a yes. to be honest, i only agreed to go because i knew i had to do this for myself so that i wouldn't live with the possibility of regret that i did or did not see him in his dying days (even though i know i don't owe him anything). it was also an hour and a half drive from where i currently live in louisiana.

so when i went to go see my dad, the doctor wanted to speak with me, my aunt and uncle first about what to do and who's going to have the power of attorney. i told them i wanted to withdraw my responsibility and then the doctor said that i can give it to someone else. i gave my aunt and uncle that option and they said they were in the same boat as i was and didn't know what to do either. if none of us decides to hold that responsibility, then the decision will ultimately go to the state and it'll be up to them with the next steps of care. i also asked if there would be a financial burden to whoever becomes his power of attorney. the doctor said she wasn't sure but she believes that he has medicare/medicaid, but anything not covered by them would be the responsibility of the power of attorney. 

so i finally go in to see him with my aunt and uncle and he just seems kind of unresponsive. he has very little brain function and is pretty much equivalent to a person who has gone through several strokes. my aunt was trying to wake him up to open his eyes, and he slightly fluttered his eyelids. they told me to talk to him. so i asked them if i could have some privacy because i really didn't know what to say. i just kind of stood there for a second after they left and just talked about myself. i felt like i was in an interview or something. i was just like ""hey dad..... it's liveliftlove"" and he turned his heads towards me and opened his eyes a little bigger, but i'm not sure what brain functions are still working (doctor didn't have mri on hand so we weren't sure what brain functions weren't hypoxic) and i just started talking about myself. i told him i'm turning 27 year this, i've gone to college, have 2 degrees, don't have any kids, have a side business, and am currently living in louisiana. then, i said something along the lines of  ""i know it's been 21 years since you've seen or heard from me..."" and then i started choking up because i knew what i wanted to say next but i had a difficult time saying it. a part of me just wanted to get super angry and say ""i turned out okay without you or maybe because you left i became who i am. you had nothing to do with raising me and the successes i have achieved to this day"". ultimately i said i forgave him and that i hope he finds peace and happiness in the next lifetime or whatever it is that he believes him. i saw tears come out of his eyes, so i'm not sure if he heard me and was reacting or if it was just because he had all of these tubes in and out of him and he was having some sort of gag reflex. it was just kind of hard to recognize him because the majority of his face had something covering it with the ventilating and feeding tubes. i still felt like i was talking to a stranger, but i just hope he knew i was there and that it made him feel better. i don't feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulder or like a sigh of relief. i'm actually pretty okay with whatever happened, and i know i won't have any regrets with that part of my life. 

apparently, he has a group of friends that was also there and they all looked at me and was like ""omg, she looks just like the mom."" i got annoyed after we visited, and we all sat together in the waiting room talking and trying to find out more information and they just kept telling me i'm his child, i need to do this, this, and that and to force my brother to come see him. i just didn't say anything because i didn't want to be disrespectful. in my head i really just wanted to scream ""fuck you and fuck your opinions, because you guys got to know him more than i ever had and it's not anyone's fault but his that he chose not to be a part of my life so don't you dare tell me what i should and should not do."" but we found out that they got in touch with the wife in vietnam and she's trying to come over here to visit and she has been given the power of attorney, so he's currently on full code until they can get her a visa/sponsorship over here (which he'll probably pass before that can even happen). 

thanks everyone for reading. i know this update is a little long, but i thought it might've been courteous to those who have taken their time to offer their advice.

"i was passing by my son's bedroom and was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. then, i saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow, addressed to, 'dad'. with the worst premonition, i opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands.... 

""dear, dad.

it is with great regret and sorrow that i'm writing you.

i had to elope with my new girlfriend, because i wanted to avoid a scene with mom and you.

i've been finding real passion with stacy.

she is so nice, but i knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than i am.

but it's not only the passion, dad.

she's pregnant.

stacy said that we will be very happy.

she owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.

we share a dream of having many more children.

stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

we'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

in the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for aids so that stacy can get better.

she sure deserves it!

don't worry dad, i'm 15, and i know how to take care of myself.

someday, i'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

love, your son, joshua.

p.s. dad, none of the above is true.

i'm over at jason's house.

i just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.

"ontario my roomate has just told me i'm supposed to move out so her boyfriend can move in *we are both on the lease*. location: ontario. 

i have been on lease at a shared two bedroom with a roommate for 3+ years. both of our names are on the lease. 

due to health reasons, i legally subletted my room for 8 months (ongoing.) the landlord has approved the sublease. i am in a different city with family, currently. did due dillegence to find a great roommate to share spade etc, they (the subletter and roommate) get along fine etc. 

my roomate has messaged be out of the blue, now saying that she intends for her new boyfriend of four months to move in after the sublease ends in june, and if i want to return to the city, i will have to find new accommodation, as he will be replacing me. 

now, i fully intend to move back to the city- as i have to finish my uni degree there. the location is ideal and frankly i wouldn't be able to find something as affordable (i pay under 500 for my room) and would likely have to put off returning to school longer if i needed to worry about moving expenses and now pay 700+ in rent in rando student accommodation. the apartment, i view as my home, as i do not have permanent residence elsewhere. 

so, i don't want to leave. does she have a legal case to 'kick me out', provided i don't extend the sublease past 12 months? 

additionally, what can i do to protect myself? 

additional context: my sublets room is furnished with my furniture, and about half the apartment furniture is mine / all the plates etc. i left those items there because i have known my roomate for 8 years and intended on returning. (although, they made a fuss about me keeping things in our storage locker, wanted me to leave certain things but empty them of my belongs so they could use etc..  but that's a story for another time and another subreddit)

they have a wee bit of a mean streak, and i just want to make sure all my bases are legally covered, so that i can return assuming i don't find other accommodation. (in the far off hypothetical i found something better, i would give 60 days notice to the landlord, her etc) 

i am hoping this can be sorted though us talking. 

last- is there anyway she could move the boyfriend in without my consent if he is not on the lease? 

thanks in advance guys.


edit: thanks for the response so far. to clarify 

regarding lease renewal: this is our 4th year on the lease, and in ontario once you've been a resident for 12 months, the lease rolls over month to month, to my understanding. for the past two years we have, at the end of 12 month in july, we have signed new rental agreement's with the max allowable rent raise (1.5% a year or something) 

so i believe that i am legally protected by the lease, and my right to the apartment stay as long as subletting is less than a year and a day. (i still pay the rent, after deposited to me by the subletter and the onus if the subletter *did not * pay fall soley on me)

could someone versed in ontario law please confirm my understanding? 

updated: wow everyone thanks for all the advice. i'm hoping to resolve this with my roommate and i've sent her a message. i'll also be looking into chatting with a professional if nessisary.  ",2
what's a non-sexual moment equivalent of an orgasm?. ,1
"for sending my family an angry email because they still speak to my ex-husband and even have him over, especially in light of his present ""relationship"" with a girl 20 years younger than him?. so basic background is i'm 42, two kids age 14 and 12 and signed divorce papers in april after almost 2 years of it being drug out trying to get my fair share from him. the details of ""why"" are not important but i'm angry, embarrassed, lost and sad any given moment of the day. a lot of this has to do with feeling like i've been ""replaced"" by a 23 year old surfing instructor who is everything i'm
not. my husband and kids claims that she is just his friend and helping him learn his life long desire to surf but jesus christ...give me a break. 
 

my husband has primary custody because he had better lawyers who were able to manipulate some minor missteps on my part into the court seeing them as a huge deal. so this past weekend i picked up the kids and said we were going to visit my parents. they said they would rather use thier season passes to sea world since they spent all weekend with my parents and aunt stacey and uncle brian (my brother and sister who i didn't even know were in town). i was like your dad took you? they said yes that my parents had invited him over to see everyone. i was devastated because while i don't get along with my brother and sister (and my mom) they let my ex-husband know they were coming and not me. i can't even let that sink in without tears forming. i sort of jested that ""oh and let me guess ms surf instructor was there too?"" my daughter said ""well actually we all went to her house in ocean beach because she gave stacey and brian lessons after ours."" that included my mom and dad. i was so devastated i took the kids back home and just went home and cried for an hour. 

when i was done i sent a furious email to my entire family how inappropriate they all had been and then not only hanging out with my ex for an entire weekend, but his little chippy as well is a massive slap in the face and the fact they didn't even tell they were in town let alone invite me makes me feel so alone. 

my mom was the only one to respond and she basically said ""yes it was rude we didn't tell you stacey and brian were  here and we shouldn't have done that. but we didn't divorce bradley, and we still see him as a son. this email along with your behavior over the last 5 years should really give you insight into why we might not want you at family events."" 

in so many words she called me asshole for sending the email, was i?

"recently paid off my car and crunched some numbers... 2013 nissan altima tco. tl;dr: owned nissan altima 5+ years, 100k+ miles... tco: $0.39/mile

i paid off my car loan in november 2017 and decided to see what the actual cost of the car was over the 5+ years that i've owned the vehicle. this was my first big purchase after starting my first job after college. i am an engineer and lived in a very low col area when i purchased the car, yet gas was very expensive (rural upstate ny). here are some pictures to help you understand my explanation.(https://imgur.com/a/9eo2t)

**edit** if you look at the graph and chart linked above, you see that i have a kbb resale value of $9000 (as of 1/26/18) that i factor in to the equation. this is subtracted from the total amount spent and then divided by the total miles to get the tco/mile

**2013 nissan altima 2.5sl**
purchased in burlington, vt but registered in ny

**purchase price & financing**
purchase price of the car was $24,349.82 after all of the applicable fees were added to the sticker price. i was very nervous having never bought a car before and was a little nervous negotiating, so i didn't do a very good job of getting the price down. (*having bought a car with my wife in 2017, i was much more informed and negotiated a better trade-in value of her old car*) i put $4000 down after saving up for several months. still living on a college student's budget but making engineering money allowed me to have a lot of expendable income that i stowed away to purchase the car. i had minimal credit, so i was given a 4.99% interest rate if i financed the car for 5 years through nissan. *edit: payment was $384/mo for 60 months with some months paying extra*

* purchase price: $24,349.82 (after tax/tag/title/etc)
* down payment: $4,000
* interest rate: 4.99%
* loan terms: 60 months
* total paid: $26,984.30
* interest paid: $2,634.48


**gas**
starting day one, i kept a field notes traveling salesman edition notebook in my center console and logged the date, mileage, $/gal and amount of gas every time that i filled up. looking back on the graph, you really can see inflection points during some of my major life events (job changes, extended vacations, etc).

* total gas used: 4114.286 gal
* total cost: $10,149.57
* avg $/gal: $2.50
* avg mpg: 26.2


**maintenance, insurance, etc**
i have tried to be very strict with my preventative maintenance on the car so that i can drive it for a loooooong time. i have gotten oil changes every ~6000 miles (full synthetic) and tire rotations on a similar interval. i have had to buy 2 new sets of tires over the 108,000 miles in 5+ years which have included free rotation, balance and nail repair (shout out discount tire!). general consumables, i have replaced myself including brake pads, air filters, cabin air filters, broken interior door handle, wiper blades.

i have had 2 minor non-warranty repairs done on the car over 5 years which were paid for out of pocket.they were: a/c fan clutch & related parts ($1205) and dent on the driver f & r doors from being backed in to ($1318). having only 1 mechanical failure after 108,000 miles is pretty impressive.

* number of oil changes: 19
* oil change cost: $1086.90
* general parts: $334.51
* repair - non-warranty: $2522.33
* tires: $1254.42 
* insurance: $7319.71
* registration/inspections: $1144.75


overall, the total cost of ownership comes out to $42,301.44 (see graphs(https://imgur.com/a/9eo2t) for specifics) at time of writing with the odometer reading 108,657. this comes out to a **tco/mile of $0.39**, which it significantly less than the irs standard rate. i am happy with my purchase as it has been a very reliable car, **however** i do not think that i will purchase a brand new car next time that i am in the market for a vehicle. 

let me know what you think about my breakdown and my financial decision to buy a new car as a 22yr old individual.

"for changing my wife's clothing sizes without telling her?. my wife has gained some weight over the last year, and keeps beating herself up over it. she's always sadly talking about her sizes and calling herself too big. she lost her excitement with shopping and a few months ago i guess i made a step to change that.

she's always asking me to get things for her while she's in the dressing room, new sizes etc. she told me to get a pair of jean shorts for her in a size 6 (this size is too small for her now by a lot. she's kind of in denial about this and always asks for a size 6 and then gets very upset when it won't fit at all. she's more of a size 10 or 12 now. )

i don't know... i got a bigger size and changed the sticker on the jeans so it said size 6. when it fit she was so happy and kept showing me and saying she's so proud. she said she must have lost weight but doesn't know what she did. she bought them feeling very confident with herself. when we got home, i cut the tag off the shorts. 

i didn't mean to but a few times after that i did it again. i guess it was part wanting to see my wife happy and part not knowing how to deal with the same meltdown happening every time. she looks really beautiful even if she gained some weight. i kept doing this and only recently did she realize that the tags on her clothes are missing. she asked me about it and i said i didn't know, maybe the store doesn't use them, but she googled the store and proved they did. 

i had to come clean and now she's furious. she keeps saying i'm an asshole and treating her like an idiot, lied to her, stuff like that. my heart is broken too. we haven't spoken in days.

aita?

edit: i can't believe this became so big and i feel way too overwhelmed. hard for me not to delete the post because some people are being very cruel to me and sometimes also to my wife. insulting her doesn't make me feel better and i don't know i feel like i understand the mistake i made but not everything i'm seeing here helped me get there. since this became so big i'll try to update what happens.",3
"in a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. she was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket.... 

as the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

 slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. 

again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! 

so, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. 

with a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.

about this time, a big texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. 

well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""how dare you touch my body!! i don't even know who you are!""

at this, the texan drawled, ""well ma'am normally i would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, i kinda figured that we was friends.""",0

"my girlfriends dad made me cry.. light: casual confessions

my girlfriend and i have been together for 3 and a half years. when i started dating her i was 19 and she was 16. it doesn't sound great on paper, but i cared about her very much and i never had any nefarious intentions. when her father learned that i was 3 years older, he tried to break us up. he threatened me and i stood my ground and respectfully told him that i wasn't going anywhere. since the day we met, i have never been anything but kind and loving to her and respectful towards her family. her father and i have never been close at all, but over time the hostility lessened and it turns out that we are similar in a lot of ways. i knew that he never liked me, but a certain amount of mutual respect that grew between us.

last night my girlfriend broke up with me. i had no idea anything was wrong between us, so i was very shocked. as far as i knew we were getting ready to move in together. i had no idea what to say so i just let her leave. today i went to her house to talk to her. when i knocked, her father opened the door - she lives with her parents. i asked to see her and he told me that she wasn't there. there was this look on his face and i instantly knew that she was with someone else. i asked him and he didn't say anything. she's with someone else. great. i told him to have a good day and as i was leaving he called my name and told me that he ""misjudged me."" we nodded at one another and i left. i could see that he meant it.

"today i accidentally hit a cat and just kept on driving. i was grabbing some takeout earlier today and it just ran out in front of me. i felt my car hit it and looked back and saw it sort of... run/spaz/fling itself out of the street. i panicked and kept driving but eventually i felt so awful about it that i turned around. it's the first time i've ever hit anything other than a bug or a bird so i figured i'd go back there and if it was still there, i'd help it but if not, i'd just move on. i didn't know what else to do.

well, i got down there and at first, i didn't see anything. i was relieved and turned around, getting a look at the opposite side of the road.

a small crowd of what looked like two families was sort of gathered around a little bundle in the grass. there was even a kid there. when i turned into the road, i saw the bundle was the cat with a little towel tucked around it. there was a lady on the phone and a guy sitting next to the cat.

i kept driving.

i didn't know what to do. i didn't know if it was their cat or they were just better people than me who actually stopped to help the cat. they didn't see me or try to wave me down. it's not like i don't care. i have two cats and i know what i'd want someone to do if they hit either of them. but i panicked and chickened out and now i'm home, eating my takeout and snuggling my cat and crying and feeling awful.

i didn't want to tell my family, but i had to say something to someone.

if the person whose cat it was is reading this, i'm really sorry. i didn't mean to hurt them, and i hope they're okay.

edit: so i realized that i made the timespan of this sort of ambiguous and made it seem... not worse than it was, obviously, because it's awful, but more hopeless than it is for the kitty. 

i turned around to check on it pretty quickly. i didn't stop immediately but i turned around within a few blocks. less than a minute. and when i got back to where it happened, someone had already gotten the cat out of the road and was helping it. while i dropped the ball in terms of helping the kitty promptly, others didnt and it was helped very promptly.",12

i feel very angry about this. i realize she is an adult but i also feel like she is being childish and over dramatic and extremely hurtful to not just me but my elderly mother who has lost the will to live.

"by not hiding my dildo well enough. two days ago i got my first dildo. since i still live with my parents, i obviously had to hide the the sinful monstrosity. where would be the best place to hide a sex toy? perhaps up high in the corner of my closet. nah, i'm short, horny, and lazy so i didn't want to climb up there everytime i wanted to get off. 

well, under my bed the boxspring has a hole in it, perfect for objects such as a dildo. the hiding spot is set up so that when you look under the bed, you can't see the hiding spot, just the empty space underneath. 

i decide to hide my dildo, as well as a several other items of contraband (condoms and an anal plug), balanced on a piece of plywood in the boxspring. perfect place for it, why would anyone be searching under there anyways.


after i get off work, i'm greeted with a text from my mom that says, ""we need to talk.""



oh fuck, she found my dildo didn't she.


turns out, while i was away at work, my mom was searching for a pair of her shoes (that i did not have) in my bedroom. i'm assuming the bed got bumped causing the dildo to fall off the piece of plywood onto the ground, but the point is she found my veiny purple dildo. 

for context, my family's religious and i don't seem like the type that would have a dildo. 


here's a couple highlights of the conversation:


her - i found a purple dick under your bed.


me - oh really? hahahahaha


her - i haven't had sex in a long time and even i've never bought one of those.


me - oh, well if you want i could buy one for you.
i'm aware this wasn't the best thing to say, but i seem to lose any filter i have when i'm nervous


at least she chuckled at that, maybe because of shock. but it made the situation slightly more bearable. 


her - why do you have one anyways?


me - well it's just my curiosity, hormones, and i felt bad for wasting so many cucumbers.
again, another stupid thing to say but i don't think she heard. or she ignored me


then she brought up the condoms, guess a couple fell down with the toy, and asked if i was sexually active. i assured her i'm not, and that i got them because they were cheap and so that i could use it on the dildo when i didn't feel like washing it. truth is, i got them because they were colorful (pink, yellow, and green) and i thought it would be funny to whip those bad boys out if i ever do have sex. but i felt like i had embarrassed myself enough already.

she was more disappointed in me than angry. i think we both shared feelings of shame and embarrassment, but she reacted differently than i thought she would. i have no idea how i'm going to look her in the eyes tomorrow.


at least she didn't find my butt plug. 



tl;dr - bought my first sex toy a couple days ago. found a good hiding spot for it, turns out it wasn't good enough and my mom found it. don't know how i'm gonna look her in the eyes tomorrow knowing what she knows about me. also relocated my toy to the upper shelf of the closet. hid the other stuff in other places of my room. don't wanna keep all my eggs in one basket. 


edit: i am 18 and female. i bought my dildo and butt plug at the same time, i refer to my dildo as my ""first"" sex toy because i used it first. hope that clarifies some things :)

update #2: it's noon and she's still not home. gonna give her a call.


update #3: just called her and she didn't answer. sent her a text too. haven't seen her since last night. getting kinda worried she might be avoiding me.

"i (27m) have unknowingly been using my gf's (27f) ex's molded dildo to get her off. hi,

a little background: i have been with my gf for a little over a year now. we both have a kinky side to us and have an active sex life. early on in the relationship, we talked about our kinks and whatnot. she said she was into toys (dildos and vibrators) among other things (porn, spanking, etc). this was music to my ears as i tend to suffer from premature ejaculation and incorporating toys is another way to make sure a girl can get off. so, i offered to go to the nearest adult store and pick out a couple of things. she suggested we could go together one day, but in the meantime, we can use the few she already has.

well, the one toy she really like getting off on is a big, thick dildo. usually we would use some toys, she could finish on the dildo and i would have sex with her. i was somewhat intimidated by the size of it (as it is significantly larger and thicker than me) and i'm smaller than average, but, like i said, i've got a kinky side and she really seemed to enjoy how big it was. we used this dildo on many occasions. a couple of weeks ago, while drinking i asked her where she got it and if it is a porn star mold. she kind of laughed and deflected. it seemed weird to me so i kept asking. she eventually admitted it is a mold of her ex-boyfriend's penis.

i was kind of floored. i've used toys on partners in the past. and when we broke up, i have thrown them out. not only did she keep a dildo molded from her ex-boyfriend's penis, she was having me use it on her to get off. since she told me this, i have felt humiliated. i asked her why she wouldn't have thrown it out, but she kept changing the subject and said she didn't want to talk about it anymore.

i feel like this is a huge violation of trust and respect. i'm embarrassed and don't know how to deal with the topic. i have rejected he advances once since the talk and a business trip has eaten up some of the time. we will be together this weekend and i am sure sex will be on the radar for her. i'm not sure how i should handle this.

they cried so hard! the oldest kept crying off and on for an hour afterwards, so i took them to a chick-fil-a for ice cream and playing to distract them. i took the bandaids off before we returned so my husband didn't notice.

that whole day, before i left and when we returned,  i thought somehow my husband knew, or would figure it out, but here we are about a week later and he's got no idea.

and guess what? they're perfectly fine now, no complications! (as i expected, duh)

i don't want a prize or a cookie from y'all or anything, after all i remember to feed them and bathe them so vaccines are just another important and required step of parenting.  

i do want to say thank you so much to those that encouraged me to do this even though my husband was not in agreement.  i don't want my marriage to have any lies, but for this, it was the right thing to do.

lastly, and most importantly:

for any parent out there in the same situation with your partner/spouse (many, many of you dm'd me) you are not alone. take care of your kids and get them vaccinated, even if you have to go around your spouse like i did. it's worth it.



tl;dr:  i vaccinated them last week. husband has no idea. walk in vaccines are available at the county health office, no appointment needed. ice cream followed afterwards. thanks for encouraging me, reddit

"why was the number 299,792,458 chosen as the definiton of a metre instead of a more rounded off number like 300,000,000?. so a metre is defined as the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second, but is there a reason why this particular number is chosen instead of a more ""convenient"" number?

"i just left my wife. and i feel 100% fine about it.. i have a reddit account, however i thought i'd use a throwaway for this one. 

ten years ago i thought i had the perfect life. upper six-figure job, beautiful wife, clean house, two new cars, and a child on the way. my job made me happy and i was good at it, and the stability was great. my wife loved me for me and ignored my flaws as i tried to perfect them. in return, i adored her and we seemed to be the perfect couple. people would always compliment us, and talk about how envious they were of our relationship and everything.

it kept getting better. i kept getting promotions, the kids (now 3) were born, and we eventually moved from an ordinary house to an incredibly nice one. my wife was doing very well in her career (optometrist), and we took fun vacations every year. again, i thought i had it made. 

i don't know how this would have prompted it, but in early 2015, i bought her a tesla, for her birthday. she hadn't gotten a new car since 2008, and i kept getting new cars, therefore i surprised her. she loved it, loved me, and i remember spending that entire day just taking rides in it and figuring out how all of the gadgets and icons worked. 

it was complete downhill from there. i don't know how that would have triggered anything, but in the months following, she became increasingly distant from not only me, but our children. my oldest (10, f) in particular, felt hurt by this and would often try to ensue conversations with her mother, in order to get her talking. some days this would work and she would be pleasant, others it would have the opposite effect. 

the first time i suspected that i was no longer her man of choice was in july 2016 when i noticed she was no longer going to yoga classes, but telling me she was. we were on the same phone plan, and part of that plan was we could see our locations of our phones. i was routinely browsing the app one day, and noticed she appeared to be at someone's house. since she had been irrationally angry that day prior to leaving, i didn't question her about it when she got home from ""yoga."" instead, i chose to closely observe where she went during her ""yoga"" times. it would always seem to end up at the same house - a well-off neighborhood (probably a step above ours) a little north of town. 

i was getting ready to confront her when i noticed that she had been returning to yoga again. during this period, she became incredibly distant, and hormonal. my entire family had noticed this behavior going on for over a year now, but i had had enough. i sat her down, and asked her what was going on. she gave me the cold shoulder, and when i questioned her about the yoga locations, she accused me of stalking, invading privacy, and being a ""grade-a dick."" 

that's when i asked her: ""are you cheating on me?"" of course, the answer was no. what followed in the weeks to come was distrust, hatred, and plain anger towards me. it was clear she knew i had caught on, and was now trying to play the ""i-can't-believe-you'd-think-this"" victim card. but i knew. i saw through it all.

when she finally admitted she had seen and slept with another man, that's when i made my mistake. i forgave her. she told me she loved me, she loved our family, and in that moment, i believed her. i thought she could change. i was wrong. 

we tried marriage therapy. we tried taking adult days. it seemed to work. we were happy, and she was genuinely having fun and it seemed like i had the old her back. i was relieved, this allowed me to pour more time into my kids and my work, and have less stress overall. 

my business trip to san diego (i live on the east coast, usa) was cut short when my colleague fell ill, and our clients insisted that we reschedule. it was a hassle, but i we caught the next flight out, and returned home. 

i'm not sure why i didn't tell her i was coming home, but i just didn't. maybe i wanted it to be a surprise? the only surprise i received when i pulled into the driveway was seeing a ford suv in my garage, and finding not one, but two men in my bed. with my wife. 

this all happened yesterday. i'm finally putting it into words. my wife started babbling when it happened, desperately trying to explain. i heard none of it. i walked out of my room, went to the basement, and poured myself a drink. i could hear the men upstairs leaving, and when i returned upstairs, it was my wife sitting there, clothed, with a sad smile on her face. 

she started talking, but i wouldn't have it. i told her to get out. i told her to get out of my house. i informed her that i'd get her stuff to her by the end of the week. she tried to pull the ""what-about-the-kids"" bullshit, but i was just done. i'm sad, but not for her. i'm sad for my kids, and i'm sad for whatever poor soul she meets next. 

i will fight hard for my kids, but my biggest fear is losing them. i know the court will rule incredibly in favor of mothers. i hope they realize that i've spent the last three years doing my best to mend a broken marriage for my family, and nothing has worked. 

i told my kids this morning. they asked why mom didn't spend the night last night. i didn't make them go to school today, they're all upstairs together. this whole situation is terrible for everyone involved, and it could have been completely preventable. 

i don't pity my wife. i hope that she has one label for the rest of her life - cheater. i want it to follow her. i want people to know. she is a prominent optometrist in our area, this could very well hurt her business if word spreads, which it very well may.

thank you all for listening. if you have undergone something similar, i'd love to chat.

"my nutjob neighbour is attempting to frame me twice in 7 days and i am concerned about what she might be cooking up next.. ontario, canada

the police have visited my house twice in the past 7 days to accuse me of crimes against this crazy woman across the street that are all fabricated from her imagination.

the first day i was woken out of bed at 11:15 pm to be accused of hiding in the ditch with camouflage and a camera trying to get photos of her at home, and shining bright lights and laser beams in the direction of her home and flashing lights inside my own house.    i told them that none of that ever happened and they don't believe me.

only 7 days later the police returned with all new accusations.   someone has stolen a chainsaw from one of my close neighbours and for some reason i am suspect number one.    they didn't tell me whos shed it was but i did see the police back at crazy ladies house two days ago, so i am fairly sure i am truly being targeted.

i feel the police give her undue credibility because she is very wealthy and i am very poor.",2

"update: i (f30) divorced my ex husband (m36) because of my mil(60s) and suddenly he wants back in. i just posted here yesterday but it feels like weeks have happened.

so i have just left my daughter with my mother and am going to my lawyer again.

i followed some advice you guys gave me and we sat down with my daughter to ""chit chat"".

we knew we couldn't promt any kind of responses my asking overly spesific questions as per her therapist.

so my mother asks my daughter (lets call her cat)

""cat what do you and daddy talk about?""

and cat just listed many toddler things like she talks about kindergarten, games etc. when i was kind of relieved that that comment my ex made yesterday may just be a one of, came the big bomb.

""he also shows me pictures of houses and tells me i can have now 2 rooms with loads of stuff!!""

i ask if her dad is buying a new house.

nope. turns out that nut wants to take my daughter out of the country. he shows her pictures of beach houses and even bought her allready a bag so she can put her stuff inside it. wich explains why so many of her clothes have gone missing.

at first i thought that my ex maybe hadn't told me yet because it hadn't come trough. but no he told my daughter to keep this as a secret because momy would get sad if she knew that daddy was going away.

so i am fucking livid. and also sad because i will have to tell my daughter no. once again i feel lost.

edit /update : i talked to my lawyer and we have taken measures that i can't discuss here but we are on it.

"by asking a bartender if he had a handjob for me. 

so, a little context.

i live in spain. i am not from spain. in spanish, we have different words that mean the same depending the country. think of it as the cookie/biscuit of latin america and spain.

today, i went to this big event they had in my city. i had to walk a lot to get there, so i was thirsty when i arrived. i decided to get to the nearest bar/pub so i could get something to drink. i enter the bar and ask for a cold tea, and the bartender gives me the can and i pay.

here's when things go wrong.

i was going to walk more, so i thought it was more comfortable to drink from a straw.

now, here's the thing. in spain, ""paji**t**a"" means straw, and ""paji**ll**a"" means handjob. 

i get close to him, and i ask him:

- *wouldn't you have a handjob for me?*

the guy looks at me, confused and angry at the same time.

+ *do i have a what for you?*

i ask again, firmly:


- *a handjob, you know.*


the guy looks even more confused. he says, in a very confused tone

+ *no.*

minding my business, i thank him and get out of the bar. it wasn't until 30 minutes ago i heard a friend of mine using the correct word for straw, and it dawned on me.

i asked the bartender for a handjob without knowing. fuck. my. life.

tl;dr: confused words for straw and handjob in spanish, ended asking the bartender a handjob.",4

"a mother trying to control her son's... alone time.. i'm 15. my family is deeply religious. i respect that but sometimes, yknow, i'm 15, and i have to, you know, rub one out. i try not to but like... i can't concentrate on anything else if i don't. and like if i see a pretty girl it'll get worse. it basically feels like sleeping to me, if i don't do it i can't function. idk if i'm normal or not. i'm definitely ashamed of it. but i'm not lying i promise. my mom doesn't believe me. my dad is out of the picture so i can't talk to him and ask him if this is a guy thing.

anyway my mom has tried a lot of things to get me to stop. she took my door off, for example. she grounded me and stuff. i try to hide it so she gives up but now she's decided to get some kind of device and put it on me so that i can't touch myself. she seemed serious and it wouldn't be out of character for her. she also does other weird things like on fridays we can't eat at all because of jesus. i try to respect that but often times i go out on a bike ride and get food somewhere. i get hungry.

what i want to know is can i refuse to wear her device? i pretty much know i will lose my phone (she'll probably sell it so i can't get it back) and stuff if i refuse but i personally think that going a while without my phone is kinda fine. i want my grades go stay ok so that i can get into college and have some control over myself and i can't do that if i'm constantly hot and bothered by every girl i see cuz, well you know.

"aitah for telling my best friend i wouldn't make the same gift i made for him for all his family members?. i'm a woodworker on the side, i made my best friend a wooden american flag because he said he would love one. only charged him cost of materials and shipping cost around $20. he then asked me to make another flag for a gift for his mom. i still gave it to him for cheap because growing up i was close with his family, but now he asked me to make the same flags for 5 other people in his family and one coworker. keep in mind i sell these size flags for $150 and he assumed this time it would still be $20 each flag. i promptly told him i can't do that cost anymore, it was only really a deal for him because he is my best friend and i agreed to it the second time bc it was for his mom but now these are for people i don't even no. told him i'm sorry but it's not gonna happen. he responded ""oh, ok..."" and it's been weird ever since, really short. should i have just done it and not risk ruining our friendship?

update: followed some advice on here and let him know i'm not upset but broke down what all goes into it. said there aren't any hard feelings but just wanted him to know why i said what i said. i'll update with his response.

update #2: he did give an apology of sorts. said he thought that getting my flags out to different people would help more people see my products which could lead to more revenue. i told him i appreciate that but i currently stay busy enough without it and that i wouldn't mind giving him 50% off only bc we're boys but this would be the last time. he said he didn't mean for it to come across the way it did. idk i still feel like it isn't resolved, we're going out for beers this weekend. going to get him to understand my side of things.

final update: he sent me a random message last night profusely apologizing. apparently he was talking to his wife and she tore into him and was upset he would do that haha he just sent a paypal payment for 5 flags at full price. glad it all worked out, i'm going to make him something customized as a thank you for the business. thank you all for the advice. ✌🏻",3
"my brother once raped me and i'm still in love with him.. i was 14 and my brother was 16 when our mom left. we didn't have anyone else so he basically took care of us. he left school to work full time so that he could afford to pay for rent and food. at the time i was really ungrateful because we didn't have much food and couldn't afford anything that my friends had but looking back i'm really grateful that he took care of me.

anyway, when i was 15 i started dating my first boyfriend. he was much older (i think he was 21) and he was just an all round bad guy but at the time i thought that we had something special. one night i had stayed at his house really late. we were sitting with some of his friends drinking beer when my brother came over. my brother came inside to get me. he grabbed me by the arm and walked me outside. i was telling him that i wanted to stay and my boyfriend and his friends pulled me away from him and beat him up. i was crying and telling them to stop, which they eventually did, and then we got in the car and left.

when we got home i was still angry at him and i stormed straight to our room and got into bed. i could obviously see that he was bleeding but i didn't realize until later but he was actually pretty badly beaten; he had a black eye, a big gash on his lip and he also had massive black bruises all over his ribs. he spent about half an hour in the bathroom cleaning up before he came in at which point i started complaining about how he wasn't my mother and he didn't get to say who i could spend time with. he didn't say anything but he was visibly angry with me and he came over, pushed me on to the bed and then held me down and raped me. i was crying the whole time but he didn't stop. after it was over, he rolled over and went to sleep and i spend the whole night crying. from the next day onwards he slept on a mattress on the floor (which he did until i left for college) and apologized every day for about three weeks and then we never talked about it again.

i know that it's horrible but ever since that night i've felt like i am in love with him. i thought that it would go away but it still hasn't. i've never told him about it and i never will but i feel incredibly guilty about how i feel. i have dated two guys but i ended it once it got close to sex. i do want to get married and have children one day but i just feel like i'm broken or something.",12

i asked her if she opened a credit card in my name and i got a long-winded story about how she was going to start her own makeup consultancy business with a pyramid scheme company since she had to move back home. she needed to pay for the initial product, marketing materials and a car wrap. it cost her about $1700. her ""plan"" was to use the money she was going to make to pay off the credit card and close the account. she can't get a credit card due to some really bad financial decisions she made in her early 20s (she's in her late 20s now).

unsurprisingly (to me) nobody wanted to buy the makeup and she had no way of paying the credit card so she didn't even try making a single payment. i laughed at how absurd it was, hung up, and sent her mom and dad a text about it and haven't heard anything back. at this point, would i need to sue her to get my money back or would that be pointless since she has no assets of her own?",2
"by slapping a girl so hard she is now deaf in one ear.  

a year or so a go i met a pretty but very shy girl on tinder, we dated, got along and then struck up a casual sexual relationship. we both had stressful jobs with long hours and just used each other to have aggressive ""stress"" sex as she called it. one day she messaged me at 1 am, she told she was very turned on and wanted me to come over. now i am a man, if a pretty girl asks me for sex i am going to pathetically come running. so up i got, had a quick shower and cycled through a wet and cold london night to her apartment (i wasn't going to pay the £35 or so for an uber). once i arrived she just wanted to fuck, she apparently had a massive argument with her ex and a long horrible day at work. so we proceeded to have sex, she usually liked it rough and liked a gentle face slap, but that night she asked me to do it harder, then harder and then even harder. her face was red and she was very evidently liking it but i was nervous, i enjoy rough sex but i was hitting her rather hard and i didn't want to bruise her face nor do any damage.

then she grabbed my head and pulled me down and bit my lip hard and said ""fucking hit me"", so i did as she asked...

after sex we were cuddling and she said her ears were ringing but she had a great time and she was in a good mood so we showered and went to bed. in the morning she woke me up by shaking me rather hard, the pillow where her head had rested throughout the night had a brown coloured, bloody discharge stain on it and she said she couldn't hear out of her ear.

i was mortified, offered to take her to hospital or that i would spend the day with her to make sure she was alright etc. i was scared there might be worse problems than the suspected burst ear drum and deep down i was scared she might hold it against me.

she went to a doctor and said she had ""fallen over"" when they asked how it happened, we stopped talking a while after that and she got a boyfriend. fast forward one year and i messaged her to ask how her ear was. she still can't hear out of it and apparently it can't be fixed :( . she was lovely about it all and said it wasn't my fault and that i shouldn't feel guilty which did make me feel a little better.

**great sex though.**  

edit: for clarity i wasn't aiming for her ear and i don't think i even hit her ear, i think i still made contact with her cheek. anyway i still feel awful about it and isn't something i want to do ever again.

"by moving in next door to a drug dealer. i posted this in r/casualuk yesterday and it went down pretty well, and a couple of posters convinced me to post it here. apologies if this is overkill and you've already read it! and honestly, i don't know if it qualifies as a tifu, so i am sure the mods will decide. be gentle, mods...  anyway, a very english break-in story is pasted below... 
  
i may have over-egged the detail, so this story is quite long. the detail is pretty accurate, cos i made notes immediately after the event, and i've tried really hard to be honest and not embellish too much!
  
on the first day of moving into my new house back in april of 2015, my neighbour came to introduce himself - and it wasn't long before i deduced that he was in the drug-dealing business. i initially thought that wasn't so bad, i like a smoke from time to time and having him next door could be useful. even if i went back in time right now to warn myself, there's no way i could convey how wrong i was... 
  
now 2015 was otherwise known as the worst year of my life. it certainly wasn't what back to the future had let me to expect. 
  
after losing my dad to cancer, my sister having a miscarriage and my bbq exploding on my birthday gathering, i was beginning to think my luck would have to turn soon. it was august, the summer was ending and nothing bad had happened for two whole months…
  
i'd been up late watching it follows, and not being much of a horror fan, i was suitably creeped out. and slightly high. my girlfriend had come home late from a work function and had gone straight to bed, and at about 12.30am i went up there too.
  
it's probably worth explaining that this house has three floors. the ground floor has an entrance, spare room and stairs, the first floor is the kitchen and living room, and the top floor is the bedroom and bathroom. it's one of three houses in a little mews in a leafy sussex village.
  
i went to bed and was soon drifting off. about 15 minutes later i heard some banging. i didn't pay it much mind, assuming that watching a horror movie before bed had made me oversensitive. so i started to go back to sleep. the next memory i have is of shouting. lots of shouting. the bedroom door burst open, and a group of large figures stormed in, brandishing crowbars.
  
i remember screaming in that way you try to in a dream, when nothing comes out. i also recall spinning around slightly so as to block my girlfriend, an incredibly sweet and innocent creature who had barely witnessed a crime in her life. i thrust out my legs, kicking one of them in the crown jewels firmly. this led the ring leader to crack me on the legs with a crowbar, telling me in no uncertain terms to not do that again.
  
so now there are at least four men lined up alongside my side of the bed. maybe five. hard to tell, i didn't get to put my glasses on. my girlfriend is screaming, they're all shouting, and i'm incredibly confused. the ringleader then demands that i give him the bag of money.
  
""what money!?"" i asked.
  
""give us the fucking bag of money, we know you've got the bag of money!"" the ringleader repeats. several times.
  
""i don't have a bag of money,"" i explained. it's hard to remember the order of events, but i do know one thing for sure - tom cruise popped into my head.
  
the previous night i was watching mission: impossible 3. i do like that film, and i had it on in the background while i did the washing up. i remember pondering the scene where ethan hunt's wife has a gun to her head. ""i want to give you what you want, but you've got to do what's right!"" exclaimed hunt. hmmm. i wonder if the screenwriter had researched this dialogue. is this what you are supposed to say in a hostage crisis?
  
well, it apparently sewed a seed, because i found myself repeating those words.
  
""i don't have a bag of money. i want to get you what you want, but you have to do what's right and leave this poor girl alone,"" are the words that came, strangely confidently, out of my mouth.
  
""yeah? well we know you sold drugs to my daughter!"" said the one i considered to be the sidekick.
  
""nah nah nah, it was my sister,"" said the ringleader in correction.
  
this exchange told me two things - one, they did not have a particularly good grasp of what their plan was, and two, they were after my neighbour.
  
for my neighbour is a drug-dealing maniac. a weird guy from essex. he's in his mid-30s, about 5'8"" with light blonde hair and eyebrows to match. he's skinny and zany, usually hopping from one foot to the other as he tries to keep his excessive energy in check. he smokes weed from 7am, and boxes on his outdoor punchbag whenever the weed isn't enough to keep his energy in check.
  
sometimes he can be seen in the communal car park making things. like the time he made a wooden triangle(https://i.imgur.com/2e6fguw.jpg). or he juggles balls with his dogs, or he shadow boxes. you know, the usual things you expect to see your neighbour doing at literally any hour of the day or night. 
  
still, realising that the intruders were in the wrong house, i wasn't entirely keen on sending them next door. as much as i disliked my neighbour, i didn't think he deserved a group of masked men storming in. so i continued to try and talk these people out of the house.
  
""i'm not a drug dealer, so i've no idea what you're talking about. there's a couple of macbooks downstairs, sixty quid in my wallet, an imac… whatever you want, just take it and go mate.""
  
hearing this offer, the ringleader realised i was being compliant. and if i was willing to give up a few grands worth of computers, why wouldn't i just give him the bag of money he was seeking? slowly, the cogs turned.
  
""is this number 27?"" he demanded to know.
  
""the whole area is.""
  
""yeah but is this number two, twenty seven acacia avenue?""
  
""no, it's number one.""
  
""we've got the wrong house!""
  
the realisation was startling. they all shouted. one guy had been searching every room, cupboard and drawer. he had given up already. one or two of the others went down stairs to get him, leaving me and my gf with the ringleader and his sidekick, a guy i suspected was far darker in soul than the guy doing all the talking.
  
""right, you can't call the cops or we'll come back. we know where you live!"" the sidekick said.
  
emboldened by the realisation that these guys were morons, i laughed. ""you seriously think i won't call the cops? best i can do is give you a thirty second head start.""
  
he didn't like that, so he took my phone. good, i thought. i'll track that fucker. sadly, i later discovered, he threw it behind my sofa on his way out of the house.
  
the ringleader then apologised. he said they were looking for someone else, and there had been a mix up. i said something along the lines of ""well i am glad we sorted that out."" at which point he shook my hand, told me he hoped my gf would be ok, and forced the sidekick to leave with him.
  
i picked up the bed and jammed it against the door, and enveloped my traumatised girlfriend in a big hug and told her it was over. which it almost was.
  
little did we know, the morons had decided to try again, this time knocking my neighbour's door in and storming his house. but he was in the kitchen, so they went flying past him, up to the bedroom where they found his girlfriend. my neighbour, being the kind of guy he is, then jumped out of the window, abandoned his gf, ran to my front door and stormed into my home.
  
""the-go-kid! the-go-kid! there are people in my house!"" he screamed.
  
""no shit,"" i responded. ""why do you think my fucking door is wide open?""
    
i went out to meet him while talking to the police on my gf's phone. he grabbed a knife from my kitchen, the phone from my hand, and went after them. i decided i was done, went back to enjoy the barricade of the bedroom.
  
it took the police a while to turn up, because the genius neighbour of mine told them they had guns, so we had to wait for armed response. eventually, my gf and i cautiously walked down to the living room. the police eventually arrived, but they knew it was too late. so they stood outside our houses having a chat and a bit of a laugh. it's likely to be the only time i tell four men with machine guns to shut the fuck up.
  
the rest of the night was a mess of police as they took statements, searched for evidence and quizzed my neighbour about, yes, the bag of money. they were convinced they could bust him for something, as they had wanted to for some time. turns out he had broken his foot when he leapt from the window, and so he was carted off in an ambulance. as the stretcher went past me in the car park, he tried to talk to me.
  
""go kid! i just want to say one thing mate! i just want to say one thing!"" he screamed.
  
""neighbour, you're not physically capable of saying just one thing.""
  
the police, who knew him all too well, erupted in laughter. this humiliation would haunt him for some time.
  
eventually i heard that my neighbour had claimed it was all because of an instagram picture he had posted on facebook, and he thought he knew the ringleader. a scumbag he'd recently connected with on fb. he gave the police two weeks to charge the guy. to the credit of the police, they arrested him but didn't have the evidence to charge him.
  
about a month later, my neighbour beckoned me into his garage where he remonstrated with me for blaming him for the ordeal. ""they terrorised us too!"" he said. he then told me he had taken matters into his own hands, dealing with the ringleader himself, putting him in some sort of box and, i presume, torturing him. he tried to show me some sort of video evidence but i refused to look at it. ""we have to look after our women!"" he said.
  
he then said that he was aware i had reacted like a pussy when the guys got into my room. a bit bemused by this, i asked him if it was more gutless to scream or to jump out a window and leave my partner behind. this enraged him, and we haven't spoken a single word to each other since.
  
the only stuff that was stolen was money from our wallets and my leatherman (it had 'that's not a knife' engraved in it). nobody was ever charged with the break-in and eventually life went back to normal, albeit with a very expensive new front door. i moved house this year, so i can only hope i never see my neighbour's face again.
  
 i know some people find this story entirely unbelievable, but it would appear i've got back-up on that front(https://ol.reddit.com/r/casualuk/comments/9ey4pe/i_endured_the_most_english_home_invasion_ever/e5tap79/) as one of the responding officers is on reddit and confirmed the story's validity on my original post! 
  
tl:dr - masked men broke in, stormed my bedroom, realised they got the wrong house, said sorry and broke into next door instead. also, my neighbour is a knob.
  
edit: i've been encouraged to post this bit of info as well - 
  
the police called it a 'scum on scum' attack, and when those inadvertently mess with innocent bystanders, the scumbags are usually apologetic. they even said ""don't be surprised if you get an anonymous bunch of flowers"". we didn't, but judging by some of the messages i have received, it really is something that happens.

"when and how did scientists figure out there is no land under the ice of the north pole?. i was oddly unable to find the answer to this question. at some point sailors and scientists must have figured out there was no northern continent under the ice cap, but how did they do so? sonar and radar are recent inventions, and because of the obviousness with which it is mentioned there is only water under the north pole's ice, i'm guessing it means this has been common knowledge for centuries.",9

"by permanently burning myself trying to connect with my recently deceased dad.. this was actually a week ago, but the story starts before that.

for the last five years, i've had an ice cream tub full of sugar in my kitchen. i emptied it into the tub rather than have the bag spill sugar whenever i used it. i don't use sugar a lot, so i've never had to refill it, i just dip into it when i need it.

my girlfriend thinks this is weird, and she thought it was weirder still when i packed the box to move with me when we decided to move in together.

""don't bring your weird five year old sugar tub, for fuck's sake.""

""it's perfectly fine,"" said i. ""sugar doesn't go off."" 

""it does,"" she said, wrongly.

""it doesn't and i'm not going to throw out totally useable sugar.""

so the sugar tub resides in our baking cupboard now, as a tiny point of pride. i want to see how long it takes for the sugar to run out. maybe it will outlive me, at which point it will be inherited by my beautiful, supportive, wrong girlfriend.

---o---

fast forward to this past january. my dad dies suddenly and unexpectedly. he falls off the roof while fixing a skylight, a day before someone was coming to start work on repairing the entire roof - including the skylight. but that was my dad to his core. he didn't know how to stop. he single-handedly ran his business - selling boating equipment and fixing outboard engines - for 47 years, a minimum of six days a week, until the day he died.

i am not that person. i love stopping. i'm self-employed too, but i put the bare minimum in to survive and spend the rest of the time doing whatever i like. my dad couldn't have lived like that. we were very different people, and that made his passing all the more difficult because now we'd never get any closer - the slightly awkward, stilted conversations i'd had with him in life were now all we had. that was as close as we'd gotten.

fast forward again to last week, early june. we're trying to sell his shop, but it's a tip. sadly, a couple of weeks before he died he invested around £50k in restocking the shop, and so the back shop is full to the ceiling with empty cardboard boxes. and the secondary room, his workshop, is full of tools, spare parts, half-empty paint cans and half-finished engines that haven't been touched in at least a decade, very likely double or triple that.

i get to work. breaking down the cardboard boxes doesn't take as long as i thought, and after lunch i start on the workshop. my dad specialised in seagull engines, which are now collectible, so i'm sorting everything into rubbish piles and this might be worth something piles.

then, at the back of a jammed drawer, under some oily rags and a grimy toothbrush, i find an ice cream tub. i open it up, and it's half-full of sugar.

the best before date is from 1998. so he's had this box of sugar since i was 12 years old. maybe longer. for his coffee i'm assuming.

i call my mum through from the front of the shop.

""look,"" i say. ""dad had a box of sugar.""

""why would he have a box of sugar?""

*""because its perfectly bloody normal, that's why.""* i take a photo to send to my girlfriend, hoping my smugness will come across without needing to caption it.

""won't it be out of date?""

""guh, no.""

she doesn't look convinced. i lick my finger and dip it into the sugar.

""look,"" i say, ""it's fine.""

i put it in my mouth, and know immediately that it's not sugar. it's bitter, and it's bubbling, and fuck everything my tongue is burning. i run out of the workshop and take a swig of coke, swill it around my mouth and spit it into the street. i do that another half dozen times, but i've already burned my tongue very badly. one of my dad's friends comes from the end of the pier.

""everything okay?"" he asks.

""yeah. ugh. i just ate what i thought was sugar from an ice cream tub in the back. it wasn't sugar.""

he laughs. ""why would your dad have had-""

""i don't know.""

he walks in and comes back with the tub. it's caustic soda, he says. for cleaning engines.

i now have chemical burns on my tongue. it's been a week, and they haven't healed. i can't eat or drink anything in the least bit hot or acidic. i told my girlfriend, and she didn't even laugh. apparently having an ice cream tub full of sugar isn't normal.

**tl;dr: my girlfriend makes fun of me for having a big tub of old sugar. i find a big tub of old sugar in my late father's workshop, and in a haze of validation taste it. it's a chemical cleaning agent.**

"i sexually harassed a girl when i was a 6th grader. we all learn about sex when we are in elementary school. for me, though, i learned about it much earlier. i was first introduced to porn when i was 7 years old.

i genuinely can't even remember where or how i came across it, but i did. i continued watching it for many many years. i still do, in fact.

but one thing porn doesn't really teach you is the law. aside from the occasional intro text saying ""all models are 18 and older"", i knew nothing else.

by 6th grade, i unfortunately knew the act of sex very well. years of watching that kind of stuff teaches you a bit. what i didn't know were the laws about sex.

i knew the basic stuff like rape being illegal and stuff like that, but i didn't know what sexual harassment/assault were or that they were illegal.

well there was a girl in 7th grade that i knew from the year before that walked the way i walked home from school.

the middle school bus (which came from a middle school many miles away) would drop the 7th and 8th graders off at the elementary school and have them walk home.

fair enough.

well i would harass this girl almost every day after school. i would say things like ""hey, sugartits!"" ""nice ass!"" and way worse things that i can't really remember.

i knew these things were not ok to say to her. i thought they were frowned upon, but i had no idea what i was doing was a literal crime. i don't know what the fuck was going through my head. i just felt a push or an urge to say them.

well she went and told the vice principal about it. the day i got called in, i played dumb. i said ""no. i don't know who you're talking about."" the school let me off with no repercussions. nothing on my record or anything.

i stopped talking to her because i didn't want to get in trouble, but i still waved at her sarcastically and i would wink at her.

if you look through the paperwork, the whole thing was forgotten about, but the paper isn't always right.

about 7 months ago, i woke up in the middle of the night after having a dream, more like a flashback, to the terrible things i said to this girl.

i had completely forgotten about it since it had happened so long ago (more than 10 years ago). 

since i remembered it, i can't unremember it. 

for the past 7 months, i have been searching on social media trying to find this girl and ask her for forgiveness, but i've had no luck so far.

i've since then developed insomnia and a deep hatred for myself. i am having such a hard time forgiving myself for the things i've done. 

i know that if i were to ever meet her again, i would burst into tears and beg for her to forgive me. i know for sure she hasn't forgotten it.

i'm sorry if this post goes all around the place, but my mind has been going in a million different directions this year.

to miranda, if you're reading this, i am so sorry. you have no idea how much i regret the things i did those many years ago. i hope that if this ever reaches you, you can find it in your heart to forgive me.",12
"(minnesota) my boss took my car and drove it home from work because his was in the shop and i got fired for reporting it stolen. not trolling i swear. if this wasn't happening to me i wouldn't even believe it. my location is the state of minnesota and i'm looking for advice because i have no idea what to do next.

while i was at work my car disappeared from the parking lot outside my office. the office i work at is the only building that uses the lot. i reported my car stolen but later realized that i couldn't find the keys and i told the police that as well. the next day my boss was pulled over driving my car. he has told the police that i lent him my car because his was in the shop. i didn't lend it to him and he never even asked me if he could borrow it. i told the police i didn't lend it to him. he now says he assumed he could take my car while his was out of commission and that he took the keys out of my purse. he has been charged with stealing my car and now he has a lawyer and won't say anything else. i have also been fired from my job by my bosses boss and the company owner. the reason on my letter of dismissal was for showing disloyalty to the company. my bosses boss says i need to learn how things work in the professional world. i worked there for a year and it's the only job i've had since graduating college and they aren't going to give me a reference and my unemployment application was denied because i was fired for misconduct. i know about at will employment but are they really legally allowed to fire me because i told the police about my boss stealing my car?",2
"manitoba, canada my cousin lives in a basement suite. his landlord has recently enacted a new rule in their home that states ""lights out by 10pm"" - which is enforced via circuit breakers to ""save on power"" and lower landlord's power bills, except my cousin is paying for his own power.. as the title states, my cousin is currently renting a basement suite in the house of an older gentleman who owns the property. legally, the renting situation is done by the book and follows the law to a t. however, three weeks ago my cousin received a notice stating that there will be a new addition to the rules that says ""lights out by 10pm"". my cousin isn't overly bothered by this as he is usually in bed by 9pm anyways, and he can understand his elderly landlord wanting peace and quiet at night. unfortunately, he realized immediately (when it first came into effect) that this is enforced by the landlord by physically turning off the power to the whole house by use of the circuit breakers - aside from the breakers for the refrigerators and freezers. this leads to a few problems:

1. my cousin is unable to see where he is going when using the bathroom or getting water at night without the use of a flashlight or phone (candles are forbidden in the basement suite).
2. my cousin is unable to charge his phone overnight, which is a major issue as he needs it for an alarm and worries about it dying - leading him to potentially sleep in. he can't even run an extension cord from the same socket as the fridge and freezer because he might blow the breaker, and the new rule specifically states that extension cords are not permitted if they are going to be used to circumvent the new rule.
3. the landlord rarely turns on the power at the designated time (8am) due to him either sleeping in, going to church, or just straight up forgetting. this leads to shits, showers, and shaves in the dark (no bathroom window) and is generally an inconvenience.
4. my cousin pays for his own power, and therefore he should be allowed to use his power as he sees fit. instead, he has to live with this situation because his landlord wants cheaper bills.


we both understand that this a silly first world problem, but he is tired of feeling like he's living the amish lifestyle and wants to know if there is any legal recourse he could take to find common ground with his landlord. he isn't look to sue the poor man, he just wants to use his own power and is willing to make compromises so both of them are happy. if he could just have the breaker for the bathroom lights and the one for his nightstand/phone charger, he would be a happy camper - however his landlord refuses to budge.

does anyone have any ideas on how to approach this? what kind of lawyer will he need in this situation? thank you so much for taking the time read this and offering advice. it is greatly appreciated. take care.",2

"i sent an anonymous spring loaded glitter bomb to my ex colleague who made me leave my dream job and made my life a living hell. 
i cannot admit this to anyone i know in person. last year i left my job as a paralegal at a law firm which i absolutely loved so much. the executives, the lawyers, and the admins, i was their favourite. one time the executive even said to me ""your presence brings so much joy into the office"". well all of that changed when the executive's pa was hired. she was a 30+ year old single, rude and desperate woman who treated me like a pet. after she passed her probation her attitude changed. she would yell at me, glare at me, talk to me with her back facing me and dump her work on me and make me work overtime without getting paid. the last straw was during christmas season when she made me carry a suitcase filled with 18 wine bottles to deliver to clients. i walked around the city for 1.5 hours in pain. despite all of this, i was always calm and friendly and i never gave attitude. 

i left for a better opportunity 8 months ago. still on very good terms with everybody, i even sent them chocolates and flowers during christmas. last month i decided to order a spring loaded glitter bomb to be sent anonymously to the pa. the most beautiful part is that the office doesn't have a reception. so she would've received it directly and opened it at her desk. 

despite this being immature and petty, i don't care. i'm satisfied. 

dear pa, i remember how much you hated a messy desk. well i hope you still find glitter in your keyboard and desk till this day and perhaps next time, fix your rude attitude. 

edit: for those who are wondering why i let this pa boss me around - i was 19 years old at the time, i was innocent, and it was my first job. i always believed that i should behave and do everything she said because it was my job. i'm not that person anymore and i've learned from my experience.

"when working retail, replace ""sorry for the wait/trouble"" with ""thank you for your patience"". a few months ago i started working for a coffee shop in a rich neighborhood.  a lot of customers get upset if they don't get their drink right away, and it doesn't help that we're often very busy.  i've found that switching ""sorry about the wait"" with ""thank you for your patience"" makes quite the difference.

""sorry for the wait"" is a very negative phrase.  ""sorry"" implies that the listener has to deal with something unpleasant due to a fault of the speaker.  ""wait"" implies frustration and impatience.

""thank you for your patience,"" on the other hand, is much more positive.  ""thank you"" is flattering to the customer.  people feel good when they're thanked.  ""patience"" implies calm and understanding.  on top of this, it's easy to say with a smile.  people tend to not feel as comfortable getting upset at somebody who is smiling.  it's a lot harder to say a negative statement like ""sorry for the wait"" with a smile, as saying ""sorry"" means you are expressing sympathy or admitting fault.

of course it's not going to work 100% of the time.  some people are just irrational and impatient.  but i'd say a good 90% of the time when i use ""thank you for your patience,"" the customer responds with ""no problem"" or ""don't worry about it.""

**edit**: okay, so a few things to mention here.

a lot of people are saying ""thank you for your patience"" is condescending.  tone is a very important thing here.  if you say it in a tone like an elementary school teacher speaking to 10 year olds, then yes it is condescending.  when using this phrase, you have to use a tone that shows the customer that you genuinely are grateful that they have been patient.  and the key here is being genuine.  if you don't give a shit about their wait, then no matter how you say it it's going to come off as condescending.  if you genuinely appreciate that they are waiting, your tone is going to come off much more friendly and appreciative.  this lpt won't really work if you just use your generic ""retail voice.""

some people are saying that the apology is better because you are taking responsibility for it.  the thing i've learned about retail is that if you take responsibility for every thing that goes wrong, you're going to have a miserable time.  if it is your own mistake, such as ringing in an order wrong, an apology usually won't hurt.  but there's no need for you to apologize if somebody else made the mistake, or if a customer came in with a large order, or if you can't do something due to company policy, or really for anything that happens outside of your control.  saying ""sorry"" in those situations only makes you a target for the customer's anger.

people are inclined to mimic the behaviors of those around them.  if you act in a very positive manner with a smile and positive words, most people will act positively in return.  if you speak with many negative words, it makes it more likely that the person will react more negatively in return.  it's not going to work 100% of the time.  play it by ear.  some situations may work better if you apologize.  some people would rather have their ego stroked with a ""thank you,"" while other would rather hear you apologize.  but i've found in my experience working with a large number of customers every day, people tend to react more positively to ""thank you for your patience"" simply because it is a more positive sounding statement.",8
"my parent/sibling/significant other/friend wants me to cosign on a auto loan/mortgage/student loan with them. should i do it?. one of the most common recurring questions on /r/personalfinance these days seems to involve a scenario where a close friend or family member, often a parent or sibling, wants the poster to cosign on some sort of financial commitment for which the acquaintance would not otherwise qualify, due to problems such as poor credit, insufficient/inconsistent income, or other unspecified issues. 

in many cases, the person pressuring the poster to cosign will offer an emotional argument which resonates with the poster, such as pointing out times in the past where they've helped the poster in one way or another. 

this post is an attempt to canonically summarize the community wisdom around this recurring topic.

**here goes:**

if you cosign on any sort of financial obligation with another person, you're equal partners in that obligation. this means that you're on the hook for payment just as much as the person asking for your cosignature. there are (at least) two major implications of this fact:

- if the person for whom you are cosigning finds themselves unable or unwilling to continue making timely payments, **you** will be pursued for the debt and held accountable as much as they will be. this means that unless you step up and take over making payments, debt collectors may be sent after you, the delinquency will likely be reported to your credit score, and you will, broadly, suffer the exact same consequences as if *you'd* defaulted on a loan that was solely in your own name.

- additionally, and *just as importantly*, even if all is well and timely payments are being made, the loan will show on your credit report as though it is yours (since it effectively *is*). this means that in the case of a major loan such as a mortgage, or even an auto loan, your ability to get a loan of your own in the future may be negatively impacted. if you cosign on a mortgage to, say, help a parent out of a bind, you may find yourself unable to secure your own financing when you're ready to buy a home of your own, as until the cosigned loan is paid off, you already have a mortgage.

for these reasons and more, the community consensus is almost always that cosigning a loan is inadvisable and should be avoided. do not cosign on any obligation that you aren't prepared to take full responsibility for if things go awry. if you're absolutely sure you could and would take on that responsibility without derailing your other financial goals, it **might** be okay to *consider* cosigning on, say, an auto or student loan -- but if you aren't ready for that responsibility, then run, don't walk, away. as for a mortgage, it is advised that you should never cosign on a mortgage with someone you are not married to, full stop. this means you are advised not to cosign on a mortgage for a sibling, parent, or friend -- ever. marriage (in the united states and countries with similar legal systems around marriage) comes with legal parameters to help determine what happens in case two people separate while sharing a debt. if you aren't married, there's no protections, and any sort of falling out or separation is dramatically likely to result in a major, regrettable headache. 


furthermore, even if you feel that you are fully prepared for the possibility of being held responsible for payments, take time to deeply consider all other potential financial implications of the decision before taking on this commitment. when a bank refuses to provide specific financing to a person, that means that they've made a determination that it's a bad idea. if they've made determined that it's too risky for them to facilitate the financing, it's almost always safe to say that it's too risky for you to consider as well.

no matter how hard someone works to convince you that you're in a position where you can do them a major favor, it's important to recognize that by cosigning on a debt that they are potentially not going to be able to repay, you would be setting them up for even more significant hardship down the road. even if it seems difficult to refuse, in the vast majority of cases, choosing not to cosign is ultimately the better choice for *all* parties involved.

"lpt before buying a memory foam mattress, do some research on memory foam manufacturers. many will custom build you a mattress for a fraction of the cost, with literally the same materials.. edit: since everyone keeps asking, start here: https://www.thomasnet.com/products/viscoelastic-foam-30688758-1.html
do your homework and make a few calls.

if you're willing to make a few calls, you can get a chunk of premium memory foam for cheaper than a conventional spring mattress. these are the same people that produce materials for the major brands. it usually would not break any rules, and would make them more money, to cut out the middle man.",8
"view your time as an investment, and pay attention to what gives you the greatest return. think of how stingy you are with your money: if someone on the street asks for $10, you're not giving it to them. there's no way you're giving a 30% tip for a normal dining experience. and so on. 

and yet so many of us just waste ungodly amounts of our time. we throw it away, every day. i know i do unless i'm careful. what helps me to not waste time is to see it as an investment, and to keep track of the returns i get for my investment. 

this approach has led me to recognize that some things offer incredible immediate return on investment: a night spent learning a new song on my preferred instruments, for example, gives me a lifetime of being able to play that song. that's an incredible return. other investments are more like low-interest, high security, long-term investments: going to the gym, eating right, etc. some, like reading good books, are kind of a combination of both. 

but many activities are worthless from an investment perspective: whatever benefit they seem to give doesn't last any longer than the activity itself. reddit is a great example: i can get super-invested in a reddit conversation, but at the end, the second i shut down my computer, i've gained nothing in return. it gives me absolutely nothing of value. i've invested my time into junk. 

edit: some obvious things here. first of all, what's valuable and not is ultimately your own personal judgement. if you feel that your time spent on reddit helps you build the life that you want, then by all means, fill your boots. it doesn't build the life that i want, though - and yes, i'm aware that that seems hypocritical, but the fact is that i am highly aware that i'm procrastinating right now, and that i'll loathe my time spent on reddit when i lay my pretty head down to sleep tonight. 

edit: sorry i criticized reddit omg. but for real, maybe you guys are all just a hell of a lot more disciplined on here than i am. you come for salient information, trenchant and high-minded interactions with others, and then you sign out in a crisp and efficient manner. not i. reddit is one of my boogeymen, so feel free to substitute your own time-waster.

final edit: holy smokes, if i would have known this was going to blow up, i would have taken more than 45 seconds to write it and would have made some things a bit clearer. there's some confusion or perhaps defensiveness about the point i was trying to make. first of all, the examples that i used were all solitary pursuits, but that was just random - for instance, for myself, i don't think that there's a better investment of my time than playing music with my friends, or going on trips with friends and family. those memories last a lifetime. absolutely worth every second - and dollar. secondly, i definitely don't want to imply that time invested in experiences is a waste - that's the exact opposite of what i'm trying to say. experiences, rather than material things, are what i've chased for most of my adult life. 

really, this never should have blown up because it's not profound in the least. we all know that wasting time leads to unhappiness. all i was trying to say is that one strategy that has helped me to avoid wasting time is to see time spent on something as an investment, and to question what return on it i'm getting. investing my time in learning a new skill, being a good husband and father, making new memories with friends and family - those investments will yield a good life. other investments won't - eating junk food late at night on reddit, for example. and for me, yes, reddit is a serious time sink - something that i'm trying to deal with. 

lastly, i'd push back a tiny little bit against people saying that time spent enjoying yourself isn't wasted. mostly, i agree, but sometimes, avoidance takes the form of enjoyment: if there's something that i know i need to do, and i watch netflix instead, hell yeah i enjoy myself during that time. doesn't mean that it wasn't a shitty investment of time, though. so, don't confuse avoidance/escapism with true enjoyment.",8
"by having my mom clean up my gallons of dried cum under the side of my bed.. ok so this actually happened 8 years ago. i was 16 and was just getting into the habit of watching porn on my phone in bed on the iphone 3gs at the time. now keep in mind that my parents are very religious and conservative, and i grew up in what you'd say a privileged household as well.  

almost every night right before going to bed, i'd watch porn for about half an hour whilst slowly stroking my dick. just as i'm about to cum, i'd tilt my body sideways, dick aimed at the wall on my right, and shoot straight down there. i was in the mentality where ""if it's under the rug no one will find out"" similar to when you drop chips on the floor. 

anyways, i kept doing this for about a year, and i never really bothered to look under the bed.  

one day, my room was messy and my mom was pissy. she walks in, yells at me for having a very untidy room then she says that's it, we're deep cleaning the room right now. she makes me go fetch cleaning stuff to help out. i remember being very pissed off because she interrupted what would be my afternoon fap session.   

so carpets removed, furniture moved around, and deep cleaning commences.  

when the bed was moved to the side, i almost shat my pants when i saw the horrific view of what was under.  

sticky, yellowish, dried cum which was tainted down the wall, and into a massive puddle that had about a 10mm thickness, and you can actually see ants, and small roaches whom have been caught up and died right in that puddle. 

now my mom casually asks ""what's this?""  

in panic, i told her that i was having ice cream in bed one day and that i spilled it to the side, and forgot to tell her about it.  

she got x100 angrier at this point, telling me how careless and dirty i am. nevertheless, she seemed to have bought it.  

several minutes later, she started scrubbing the puddle of cum while i was looking in shame. i felt like the biggest sack of shit on earth. feelings of disgust, shame, and guilt overwhelmed me. i vowed to not masturbate to the side wall anymore. 

anyhow, the nightmare didn't end there. after a few minutes of scrubbing, the now wet puddle of cum starts to emit odour. shortly after, the entire room smelled of cum. it was the most disgusting smell you could imagine. i was horrified and didn't know what my mom was thinking at the time. i was just playing dumb and was pretending to move around shit in the room to make it seem i was helping her, when secretly i was shitting my pants. 

at the end of it, she just said to me ""remember, god is always watching. he's very unhappy with you."" and left.  

religious me back then cried in the same night, and i was begging for god's forgiveness for weeks in end. 

not too long after however, i realised that i learnt my lesson, and that's when i started using tissues in bed.  

tldr; masturbated to the side of the bed for a year, mom wants to do a deep clean of the room, find cum puddle, tell her it's ice cream, she scrubs the whole thing making the entire room smell of cum. 

edit: fuck did this blow up. you guys made me aware of the coconut story and the cockroaches story, i found comfort in knowing there are more fucked up redditors out here. yes it is horrible what i did and disgusting, but i promise i'm a regular functioning adult in society now.",4
"(us) ex seeking full custody of the kids for the 4th time. feels like i'm going crazy.. i posted this in r/divorce before. adding updates as to what has unfolded. 

throw away account because he stalks every thing i do. just to be safe.

two years ago i (now 29f) was out of the blue handed separation papers from my husband (now 30m)... this led to one of the worst times of my life. i found out he was having an affair. was taking our 3 children to her house and telling them not to tell me or they'd get in trouble. his behavior toward me changed dramatically. he became extremely abusive and the police were called to our home. (he was forcing me to move out but at the time i had nowhere to go, i had no money on my own.) two long days later he's charged with a domestic violence charge, and i get granted a temporary protective order. we get to court, judge drops it because he's calm in court but warns him if he even touches me he will go to jail. eventually he pleads guilty to his charge and gets a year probation. we go to court again. he wants full custody. drags me through the mud. judge said no way and gave us a 50/50 split. he's still with the woman he has an affair with. i ask for 6 months of no paramours around the children because he wanted to move her in immediately and i believed the kids needed some healing time. judge agrees and adds it. he's livid. in the 6 month period he gets her pregnant. we go back to court again after the 6 months.  he again asks for full custody. judge denies and keeps it at 50/50 because it's working for the kids. the other woman however we find out after court had moved in about a month before the 6 month period had ended. he told the kids, again, to lie to me or they'd be in trouble. some time passes, i meet an amazing man. we were good friends first, then decided to try dating. dating is perfect. i introduce him to the kids. the kids adore him, he adores the kids. it's going nearly perfect. except my ex is flipping out because how dare i move on. how dare i involve him with the kids. i don't deserve to move on he claims. more time passes. we move in together. kids have their own rooms. they love it here! my divorce finally becomes final. ex gets married the very next day after we are granted the divorce. the next day after that he files a show cause because i moved in with boyfriend. he wants full custody again. my youngest then tells my mother that some strange things have been going on with daddy and she doesn't think it's right. daddy tells her not to trust mommy's boyfriend because he's going to hurt them and touch them in the no no places. this goes on. more and more of these comments are revealed that my ex is telling them my boyfriend is going to hurt them. we go for our pre-trial for the show cause, it's granted to move forward. date is set. not a week later i get a call from cps that they need to investigate an allegation that my boyfriend touched my oldest. we do the interview, cps clears him completely. it's obvious he hasn't done anything because he's never left alone with the kids. i'm in charge of baths, etc. however, the cps worker thinks she has been abused, but she was coached to say it was my boyfriend. they seem to think it was my ex or my ex's father or my ex knows it's his father and he's covering it up. so now they are investigating his family instead. we are waiting for the results and what is uncovered. 

im shaking all the time. i haven't slept right in days. i can barely eat. my baby was hurt. i knew it in my gut. it was attempted to be pegged on my boyfriend but they found no way for the allegation to be possible. 

it's all a mess. this is beyond who deserves custody. this is who hurt my daughter. how can i get justice for my daughter and help her heal from this .. 

update: my boyfriend has been 100% cleared of any allegations. it was ruled unfounded, as we expected. however, the ex has decided to ignore our custody agreement and only give two of our three kids to me. we did week on week off. when i went to get them at our usual meetinf spot a month and a half ago, i was met by an off duty police officer that was a friend of his family letting me know i would only be getting two of the children as the oldest is now ""terrified of her mother and the mother's boyfriend."" i attempted to call another police officer but they said it was a civil matter. i filed a show cause for him violating the custodial agreement. tomorrow is our court date. i have not seen my oldest child in over a month, have not been allowed to talk to her, or my questions about how she is doing are ignored. ex just won't talk to me at all. 

my attorney says this is an obvious and clear cut case of parental alienation and it's obvious he wasn't getting his way so he escalated his claims to attempt to get custody. 

obviously, i don't think this is going to be a cake walk. however, i just want to know i'm not crazy and this is actually an attempt at parental alienation and i'm not going to lose my children to a monster who is an expert of maniuplation.

"askscience ama series: i'm matthias hebrok, and my lab has just published a breakthrough in making insulin-producing cells in a dish. my team at ucsf hopes to one day cure type 1 diabetes with transplantable beta cells made from human stem cells. ama!. i'm a stem cell biologist and director of the ucsf diabetes center. my lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. we just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7unbjg

my lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (t1d), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. currently the only cure for t1d is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

one of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. they sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. we can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

by producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as crispr to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.


i'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. i'll be starting at 9am pst (12 et, 16 ut). ama!

"ga just moved into a condo, neighbor is tasing hell over my nonexistent pet bird. i just bought a condo that has been vacant for a while. right after i bought the place, before i even started moving in, i got an official warning from the hoa that my next door neighbor has called their emergency line 3 times over my pet bird that is so loud in the mornings it startled him awake and caused him emotional distress. in their email they specifically said what time my bird was making these loud noises. 

now, the thing is i don't have any pets, and for the past few nights i've stayed up to that specific time to see if i could here anything loud and disturbing as he described(which i did not, aside from a few birds chirping quietly outside). however, this neighbor is still calling the hoa's emergency line every night to complain about my bird. the hoa manager doesn't believe i don't have a pet bird, even though i've offered to let him come see. he said that i could just be hiding the bird.

today i got a letter from animal welfare and enforcement about my bird's vocalizations disturbing the peace. it said that i can be taken to court because of my bird if the neighbor complains again. i don't have a bird or any pet.

i've tried talking to the guy, but he refuses to answer his door, and when he comes out to watch me leave for work, he'll shut his door and ignore me if i try to talk to him. am i seriously going to have to go to court because this guy thinks i have a pet bird? how am i supposed to prove that i don't have a bird?

"pubs and bars are far better than a nightclub. could be a bias since i come from a family run pub now. but before we lived there i used to hate night clubbing. there was nothing worse than shouting to hear anyone next to you, terrible music and paying double the price for a drink. i see the appeal as everyone meets everyone who goes to a nightclub as it's a big release to dance and so on. however, i do believe that if we didnt have social media we would still be meeting in pubs and bars. 

with a pub you can sit down and talk to people, actually make a connection with them. you can drink and not pay too much for it either. live bands and jukebox throughout the week. i think you can just enjoy yourself more and talk to friends and meet new people. rather than everyone in night clubs listening to sean paul on repeat, dancing a two-step, getting overly drunk, maybe some drugs? all to end with a kebab, a headache and no money to show for it.

edit: okay i get it. not as unpopular as it may seem as to what my experiences with clubbing and living in a pub are. maybe my demographic who think its unpopular are still too hungover to be on reddit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

"im actually so fucking happy. i made the best decision in the world 4 months ago and moved in with 4 of my mates. it's the best living situation i've ever had we all hang out in the evenings like a little community and catch up on our day, my social anxiety and depression have reduced, i'm no longer in debt and i'm arranging to move to a new city next year, to study my passion, photography. i'm getting out into the dating scene and it's going well. from someone who suffered severe depression i genuinely didn't know this is what happiness would be like.i look in the mirror every day and i'm slowly starting to like the person i'm becoming.

update: thank you guys so much for all the nice comments, really enjoying reading them. i thought i'd give some more detail since this is garnering attention. about 2 years ago my depression got so bad that i refused to leave the house and clean my room or do anything. i'd go months without cleaning and not seeing anyone. after a while i decided to make a change, things were so bad that i'd promise to clean and then just not have the will to follow up. i started forcing myself to clean everyday and set routines and goals, since that point i've promised to make the right decision with whatever life throws at me, if the dishes are needing done i forced myself to do them no matter what. i got a job as a bartender, i was so socially anxious that i couldn't talk to customers. every day i was forced to make small talk with people thanks to my job, i sucked at first and things were awkward but i started getting better and better. i've worked there for a year now and i'm easily able to banter with customers and coworkers, i also had to chat to dozens of women every day and it really helped me be comfortable around women. now today i can chat to anyone with no issues now, i'm totally comfortable around women and have been going on more dates than ever. i'm doing well financially and everything's good. best of luck with your journey, cheers.",11

"for locking the door at my in-laws house overnight?. my in-laws live in a sleepy artsy fartsy town where nothing ever happens. they know all their neighbors, half of the family lives near by. they're the kind of people who are comfortable with anyone coming in or dropping by unannounced just to say hi, show someone something on their phone, etc. it's very full house.

so that being said, they don't lock their door. we've piled into the car to go to the store or other places before and i've said ""do you have the key?"" to be (gently, not meanly) laughed at and had it explained that they don't need to lock the door. 

i'm not comfortable with that, but i didn't say anything. i just moved my travel bag into my car. when we went to get ready for bed, i passed by the door and saw it hadn't been locked. i asked if i should lock up for the night and the family chuckled again. i felt extremely uncomfortable, so for peace of mind, i locked up. 

in the am, fil got up and went to get his paper. he found the door was locked and said ""(my name), did you lock the door?""

i said yeah, very casually. he looked at me like i was crazy. i said i'm just not comfortable with leaving doors unlocked. both of them laughed, and for the rest of the weekend, the jokes continued. things like ""who hurt you?"" and ""what was so bad in your childhood that you can't deal with an unlocked door?"" and ""what do you think was going to happen, someone was going to break in? this isn't (big city we live in).""

we ended up leaving early because my husband was tired of telling them to knock it off. a few days later, my mil posted what was supposed to be a funny thing  on fb and tagged me, saying ""(my name) and husband visited, but dil isn't cut out for that (town) life! she couldn't handle a few unlocked doors and thinks the whole world is out to get her!"" cue the family making fun of me, my upbringing, etc.

i'd finally had enough and posted back: home invasions happen. my best friend's dad was murdered in their home by an intruder when i was 12 years old. forgive me for caring about my safety and infringing on whatever makes you feel superior here.""

she deleted the post and told me i was out of line, it wasn't my place to lock doors in someone's house that wasn't mine, if i didn't feel safe with them, maybe i shouldn't visit anymore. i said sure, husband and i won't visit anymore. she backpedaled and made it clear she meant just me, but i asked why he would drive all the way out there (it's about 5 hours) without me just to be with people who were mean and judgmental about his wife and a locked fucking door? this turned into another big ""you're taking my baby away from me!"" situation.

"grandparents of millennials had it much easier, yet have a tendency to call out the youth for being weak little snowflakes.. they were able to go to college dirt cheap, much more easily able to afford a house, also pretty much guaranteed a job that could support a full, average sized family (yes, 1 job for 1 person supported that much).  all of this able to happen for them by about 23 years old. 

many had opportunities to work their way from intro low level jobs such as running errands and stocking the lobby, to coasting into high ranking management positions without much schooling.  positions held to this day, that require 6+ years of schooling and $100,000's of dollars in debt.

many of them were, ""happily married 60th wedding anniversary.

but most of all, they were able to retire.  some at like 55 years old.  

**not us.**

**for us**, the chosen few lucky enough to get a scholarship and not have to spend the rest of their early adulthood paying off a piece of paper - they get the privilege of having to compete for a job where 10/200 applicants *might* get chosen. (200 who spend a minimum of 4 years in life/financial taxing poverty and pools of stress).  a pretty basic weeding out process most similar to that of battle royale games.

we work 2 high stress, physical/emotionally  demanding jobs just to make ends meet while living with our parents at 27.  

houses and gas are fucking expensive.

in this age, **for us**, the term ""happily married"". ends when one of the spouses gets caught sending/receiving dick pics from/to 17 different requesting recipients after a year 1/2 of marriage.

**for us**, we will work our high stress/physical demanding, multiple jobs to make ends meet.  we will troop through a society that views anything less then perfect as useless.  we will hopefully get support from the people that are established from a time of ease.  

but most of all, **for us**, we will work for scraps until we're fucking dead.

edit:  listen, i get they had to use practices that were physically more demanding. 

please don't tell me this when statistics tell me i'm probably talking to an overweight person.  i view physical labor as a gift.  i cherish my body and treat it like a temple on and off the clock.  i work 3 jobs, next semester will be my 4th year in college, save mostly all the money i can, after paying off car, school, hospital, phone, rent, utilities, etc... + the insurance required to cover all of those listed above and more.  i'm happy with my life even though it can be overly stressful at times.

no.  i'm talking about current, breathing minds.  minds that go out into the world and impact the current situation in the 2019, november.  united states of america.****

moving forward, i'm incredibly thankful to live in a place where i don't have to run from bullets, dictatorships, bombs, starvation, government lockdown, plague, so on - so forth.  or have the opportunity to even work a job in the first place.  i cherish all of my jobs, my education, and take pride in myself in anything that i do, which work is a lot of.

i, and *we*, have the opportunity to do better, **yes we get it.** but simply being said - in no way compares to the actual risk, commitment, and sacrifice that is inevitable with such a follow through.  back then, this was in no way the levels in which it's at today across more fields then ever before.  quit portraying that i can find 1 job and make $100k a year by following your 4 sentence paragraph of, busting at the seams, loose ended statements sewn together by great advice to somebody that was my age 23 years ago.

truth is, i also respect the older generations like no other.  but i will also treat them like human-beings as i expect the same from anybody and nobody at the same time, when somebody isn't willing to do that, i can't help but take a note of the type of person saying this.  and old people are the primary ones to even mention this topic.

what *'they'* don't understand is the stress of being a cog in the machine that is tens of millions strong who commute, eat, sleep, fuck, cry, defecate and fight next to other people, jam packed next to one another at all times of the day.  they don't understand taking the high risk chance to fall in love in the age of social media, in this jam packed sti infested society.  they don't understand working for bosses receiving immense psychological pressure from the big wigs to compete harder, faster, and more precise then ever before.  a constant demand to a nation powered by caffeine, nicotine, sex, and social media.  devoting more and more time and effort every month, week, day, minute.. seconds. the labor force is constantly commanded to do more work for a wage that doesn't move much after a certain, and quick, point.  always demanding more of us.

they may be here, but they have no idea what it's like to grow up in any of this.  this was something gradual for them, but **for us**, we never had a chance to live in a time where there wasn't war and chaos flashing across the news.  they have no idea because they lived, loved, and settled in a less toxic/chaotic, more forgiving, less demanding, and more easy-going honest time.

for flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, amber and katie. they're both eight and it was a tough decision. unfortunately for my perfect day i felt shallow and since amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) i picked her. her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did. 

during the wedding prep katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. the girls have never liked each other for reasons i don't know. i didn't pay too much mind to it since i was too caught up in myself.

on the wedding morning i got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. amber (and keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. i could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and i made amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to katie. amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days i haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother. 

my husband and i are going away on our honeymoon on thursday, and i was anxious to get in touch with my brother before we leave. he finally called me and was extremely angry at me for taking the job away from his daughter. he said amber has been crying the past two days and felt really humiliated, and was really looking forward to the job. 

as someone who was bullied myself growing up, it felt like the right thing to do after amber's behaviour towards katie. i can't imagine how upsetting those comments would be, and at that point katie, who had never been anything other than well behaved deserved it more than amber.",3
"when my husband lets me know he's on his way home from work i quickly put makeup on and spray lysol and tidy up to make it look like i actually did something during the day.. so i usually work.  but i'm in my last months of second pregnancy so i've been staying home with my two year old. it's totally out of my element to stay home but i have definitely been enjoying it. i feel guilty because my husband works his ass off. he is really a great man. lately i have been so lazy to the point where when i'm not tending to my toddler i'm just sitting on my ass, in pajamas, watching hell's kitchen or whatever trash i can find to binge watch. when i get the text from my husband ""i'm on my way home"", i quickly jump up, wash my face, get dressed, put make up on, make it smell good in the house and hide any evidence of clutter, snacks or anything that would give off the impression that i've been a lazy vegetable all day. he comes home and compliments me at how good of a job i do to make the place look and smell great all the time. anyways, it's not an extreme or super serious confession. just something i wanted to put out there cause of my slight guilt. in a couple weeks i won't be able to do this anymore because i will then have a newborn and a toddler, so i'm just enjoying this while i can. lol",12

"i broke a girls arm on purpose in soccer. i was playing soccer at recess in 5th grade, and i had a penalty kick. well the girl didn't agree with the call so she got mad and stood like 10 ft from the ball. i told her to get out of the way, but she didn't listen. so i kicked it at her as hard as i could. i hit her arm so hard it bent backwards a bit. i didn't think anything of it, till the next day she came to school wearing a cast. i never apologized and i feel bad now.

"by joking with a date i was a serial killer.. so because of circumstances beyond my control this didn't happen today.

cue my first date with a girl i met on tinder, we meet up at a restaurant and get to talking. this are going great, she thinks i'm funnier in person (when does that ever happen?!), she actually invites me to the mall to hangout more with some of her friends when dinner is over.

so after the food arrives the conversation turns a little more towards how we met (pay close attention and you will spot my mistake). she states she's glad i'm normal and not some sort of serial killer.

now i could have just laughed... i could have but i was funny remember? i replied with ""oh thanks for thinking i'm normal! but i actually am a serial killer, bodies for days buried out at the farm.""

she laughed, i laughed, i thought i did great at making it sound sarcastic.

she excuses herself to the bathroom to do whatever girls do in bathrooms on dates. it was taking a questionably long time for her to return and i was slightly worried she bailed and stuck me with the bill, my luck right? wrong.

so unbelievably wrong, my luck was worse as police officers suddenly appear out of nowhere and tell me to keep both of my hands visible on the table.

at this point i'm confused, this must be a joke. i see my date coming with a staff member and get ready for ashton kutcher to appear, no such luck.

the police ask if it's me and she says ya, the cops get me to stand up and handcuff me and walk me out, not a single person seems to want to answer any of my questions.

i'm in the car and the police are outside talking to my date for a few minutes when they get into the car with me and ask me if i told my date i was a serial killer, areyoufuckingkiddingme...

i tell them yes but i was joking.

don't admit to police you told someone you were a serial killer.

so that derailed my plans, i spent the next 5-6 hours explaining myself over and over and over that i was kidding.

i guess eventually they either believed me or got tired of hearing me speak much to my lawyers disapproval (to me speaking) and let me go and reminded me that my jokes suck.

i'm not sure how date number two will go but i'm excited to find out, also a bright side is that i have no idea who paid for my food.

tl:dr: i made a joke i was a serial killer, date doesn't get sarcasm, i spend hours in the police station.",4
"if you drizzle ketchup over your fries rather than dipping them then you don't love yourself.. i dont know when, how, or who conceived the notion that this is acceptable behaviour. ketchup and fries is a sacred meal time experience and if you're pouring ketchup over the fries you're a disgrace to humanity.

with the drizzle method you end up with too much ketchup on top and not enough ketchup to compliment the fries at the bottom. you may think its okay to just reapply ketchup after you eat through the first layer but then you're just using more ketchup than necessary.

dipping is the way it was meant to be because you not only can you control the amount of ketchup you have on each fry but also how it is applied.

par example, you can simply dip and get a good sized glob on the end or you can smear and have a conservative but evenly applied amount of ketchup.

pouring ketchup over fries is downright inhumane and needs to stop. ",6

"if i don't go to this job interview my cousin referenced me for. so like 3 months ago when i was looking for a job my cousin suggested i work at the restaurant she works at. at the time i was like yeah that sounds cool, but had also just started working for doordash just to have income. however i actually enjoy doordash and delivering, plus i like the flexibility. so the place my cousin works at never called or replied to my resumes. 

however i just ran into her yesterday, 3 months later and after talking to her for a few minutes   (we ran into each other when she was walking into work) she said she'd tell them about me again. so she calls me yesterday and said they want me to interview today. i really had put no thought into taking the job or a new one at that cus i'm content with what i'm doing now. however i spontaneously said yes. but now the interview is in an hour and i honestly don't want to go. but my cousin gave me a reference and said she's excited to work with me but i just don't know how to feel or what to do. truth is i really am not looking for another job and one has just been sprung upon me. i know i accepted the interview but, idk....

edit: i'm on my way to the interview now. i know for my cousins reputation the least i can do is show up. i'm just going to wing it and give it some more thought so if they call back and offer the job i'll have a more thought out answer

edit 2: the manager is 20 minutes late to the interview now

edit 3: actually glad i went because the reason i was hesitant was because i thought they'd be hiring me as a host. however they said they're looking for delivery and were interested in my doordash experience and said they'd cover mileage, include tips, and guarantee pay if there are no deliveries. that's more than i have with doordash so i actually am interested in this position now. they set me up for another interview. thank you to everyone here who called me an asshole and made me feel bad so i'd get my ass to the interview. actually worked out in my favor.

last edit: it was definitely an interesting day. initially when i posted this, within the first 3 minutes about 5 people said i was the asshole. that made me feel pretty bad so i went to go to the interview 10 minutes after posting. edit 1 occurred 10 minutes after the post, edit 2 about 20-30 minutes after edit1, then edit3 about 45 minutes after. glad you all enjoyed the read.",3
"the notion that you should not complain because somebody has it worse is ridicolous.. if you kill time on social media sites, you might eventually stumble across a collage of pictures and quotes. usually the there are two pictures contrasting issues that normal people experience in our relatively safe western societies, and the life of depressed people, poor people in wartorn societies, soldiers in combat etc...

&#x200b;

the gist is always the same: stop complaining, because you actually have it pretty good compared to these other lives that you never have to live trough. sounds reasonable, and certainly there is value to showing how bad life is for the unfortunate, but to say that i should not complain? fuck off.

&#x200b;

first off, where do you draw the line of ""right to complain begins after this point""? either it's arbitrary, or there really is only one person who get's that right. sorry raped, beaten and starving child, but raped, beaten and starving child who also grew up without parents have it worse, so no right to complain for you.

&#x200b;

second, complaining releases stress. we feel better after letting out some steam. nobody who has their best friend move to another town actually believes themselves to feel worse than a soldier being forced to shoot his friend who inhaled mustard gas, does that somehow invalidate the sadness and anger we feel, and does it mean that we should not get to release that somehow? ""just ignore your human impulse"" that's quite a lot to ask for. everybody has a breaking point after all.

&#x200b;

like it or not, everybody should complain when they feel upset enough to complain about it. that's human. expecting things to change because you complain however, and never taking actions to change your shitty situation, that is something that people should stop doing.",6

""daddy, i have my period"", she says. me: um ok. i get up. get dressed and point at my 9 y/o and say you're in charge. i'll be right back. i go to the store and faced with a sea of pads, i pick up a box of pads and a chocolate bar. my neighborhood cashier asks me if i found everything ok. i say yes.

i return home and give my daughter the bag. she asks what the chocolate is for and i confidently reply - to make you happier. i leave her to her business assuming mom has groomed her in some way for this moment.

"for not believing my girlfriend's 'discomfort' during sex?. pretty much says it in the title; whenever i initiate sex with my gf she winces in pain and says it's uncomfortable. yet whenever she is up for it there seems to be no pain issue at all. 

last night we were fooling around and i got her to orgasm through foreplay - zero issues or pain. i was pretty into it and initiated sex and instantly she was uncomfortable, despite me slowing down the pace. finally after one thrust she yelled out in pain pretty much directly in my face which was the final straw for me. this has been happening for so long now yet she never does anything about it and tbh i doubt there is any pain - and if there is then she seems to be exaggerating it way out of proportion. i know that people will say no vagina, no opinion; but i know for a fact that i wasn't being forceful or rough so to downright scream in my face was totally unnecessary. 

she has no other symptoms or discomfort aside from this, and like i said if she initiates then miraculously there's no problem. it's not a lube thing either, trust me i've tried that too. 

i guess the reason i'm asking is because last night we kinda had a big fight about it. i lost my cool and told her how huge a turn off it is to see her face screwed up in pain all the time, and how i didnt think the pain was as bad as she was making out. i told her that sex was becoming really boring and i could pretty much predict how it would go each time. i also said the only solution  at this point was just to not have sex. she called me an asshole and went on the offensive. said i have two moves and yet i expect her to be like a 'porn star'. 

so am i the asshole? or should there be more give and take in this scenario? can i insist she gets a medical check?

**tl;dr: girlfriend is in apparent pain any time i want to have sex, but is fine when she's the initiator. for calling her out on it?**",3

"how do i tell my sister i don't want my unvaccinated nieces to visit my newborn?. so a little bit of pretext, i live several states away from my family so seeing them is far and few between. in january i found out i was pregnant after losing twins last year, so my family is ecstatic to say the least. my sister and her husband are going through some financial struggles so i understand it's difficult to make a trip to visit, so it came as a shock when she suggested the other day, they wanted to plan a trip up here when the baby is born. the problem is she's an anti vaxxer. 

i have two nieces, 7 and 4, who haven't gotten a single vaccine in their life. i love my sister dearly, but she firmly believes in the hype surrounding their dangers, along with many beliefs with western medicine. they have no health insurance and when the kids are sick, she takes them to a chiropractor. every food must be gluten free, organic, natural, because, without testing, she just ""knows"" her children have egg, dye, and gluten allergies. ironically she's also a massive germaphobe, keeping her kids homeschooled. my point is not to knock her, my point is to stress how much of a lifestyle this whole thing is and therefore not as easy as just saying she does one thing but not the other. she is a full 100% on board with the term ""vegan crunchy granola mom"". 

last year she talked about coming up alone to visit my twins which wasn't a problem (we were vaccinated as children) but now her mentioning bringing up the kids when my baby is about 2-3 months old and therefore not up to date with shots, is sadly not an option. i was scared before but now with the measles making a comeback i'm even more freaked out and don't know how to word this. 

i know she's going to be offended and i know she's going to be upset but this is not an option nor is it up for debate. she chooses to believe in not vaccinating but my husband and i firmly believe in science and medicine and after losing two children i'll be damned if i put another child in harm's way. any advice on how i can word this to soften the blow would be very much appreciated. like i said, this is not a negotiation and it's a firm no they can't come up but i'm sure there's a better way to word this than, ""i'm terrified your children are going to kill mine.""

update: thank you so much to everyone who commented and left suggestions on how to proceed with this! i had the talk with my sister and while keeping it courteous but not personal, she was very understanding to my concern. ironically, she was nervous about the notion of being around my child once he/she *was* vaccinated as she believes the vaccine can shed and therefore infect her kids (but that's another story!) it ended on a good note with no bloodshed with her respecting waiting until my baby is good and vaccinated. thank you again to everyone, this was quite the success story!",7

"this is not a 'cicada year,' but i hear one buzzing outside right now. is there a small set of cicadas out of sync with the main population, or do a few mistakenly mature early every year? or is this a different species entirely?. there are 'cicada years' every 13 and 17 years in the eastern us, where cicadas emerge by the fucktillions and take over everything. 

but there are a few cicadas every year. i find them and their molted shells all over my yard, and i hear them buzzing away. what are *these* cicadas? the ones that pop up even when it's not a 'cicada year'. 

are they the same species as either the 13 or 17 year cicada, but a year out of sync? are they late comers or early bloomers whose development cycle missed a year and caused them to miss the party, and so they pop up without anyone else around to mate with? or is there a stable population of these cicadas each year that have drifted out of sync thousands of years ago - if so, will they diverge into a separate species after enough time? it seems like this would be a remarkable sort of allopatric speciation that's happening- instead of the population being divided by a river, they get separated by a year in their life cycle. or is that crazy because their life cycle is very rigidly 13/17 years and there's just no way in hell they're deviate from that?

"this is 20 years too late. . hello everyone. this is a rather tragic story. it will not be suitable for light hearts. it's my deepest, most darkest history, which led to my own near-death many, many times. 

20 years ago, germany, 1993. i was 20 years old. i had two sons. their names will stay with me. but i will provide aliases. my youngest, mathieu, was 14 months old. and his older brother sam, 2 years of age. mathieu was the happiest of children. he would smile at you even if he didn't know who you were. he was the sweetest, happiest little boy to ever cross into my life. both of my sons were all i needed and wanted. my wife and i were 18 when she got pregnant. she was so happy, that i couldn't even grimace. i swore my self to her and married her when she was 6 months pregnant with my sam. she was so beautiful then. her smile could make a well kept man go mental. she was an extraordinary specimen. 

                         the incident. 

 it was a freezing winter's morning. 19°f.  the roads were slick; the people's coats were packed on like the snow blankets covering the ground. i had work at 9 am that morning. i awoke to mathieu; crying. it was 8:43. i had to be at work in 17 minutes. my boss had a no tolerance policy and would dock your pay for too many tardinesses. i knew i couldn't be late. 

 i got my son and myself ready and was out of the door by 8:51. i was rushing my son and i to my mother's house, time was ticking. my lateness was inevitable. my speed picked up as my worries did. as soon as i realized, i was going 50mph in a 30mph. i had no time to stop. i skidded over the crosswalk line into oncoming traffic. i whizzed by every other car coming from side to side. but instead i was headed for a large industrial truck. my whole life flashed before me, time was going extremely slow. i felt as if i was the grim reaper, watching this ordeal from an orb of some sort. and *i* chose my fate. i came back to reality to see me nearing the truck. i maneuvered my truck to hit my side of the his. hoping to save me from my son's injury. it was no use. i survived, woke up in a hospital some time later with a broken  femur and head trauma. my son's neck was broken from the impact. he died instantly. 

i remember telling the nurse ""i want to see my son. i need to know he's okay."" she looked away, hiding her tears, and replied. ""your son is no longer with us. he died instantly from the crash. i'm sorry"" i.. i honestly could not explain the feelings after that. to know that it was your fault. you killed your own son because you didn't want to be late for work. you didn't want to get yelled at by your boss. like your job is worth taking your own son's life. after that day, my whole life changed. my wife blamed me and left without a trace. the next time i saw her, was 16 years later. she was sitting in a casket. she died from a fall while mountain climbing. the last time i saw her alive. she was crying and yelling at me, she wanted me to take my son's place. and frankly, i did too. i still do. 

since then, i've had 3 suicide attempts, several broken bones. i sliced two of my fingers clean off. (irrelevant, it was from an office guillotine.) many run ins with the law, and overall, a broken, beaten, shrivelled up heart. a heart that is set in stone. and unmendable heart. 

he would've been 21. i could've taken him and my eldest son out for a beer, like good men. and we would be a family. i would've still had my wife. i knew she loved adventure, and i wouldn't have let her go mountain climbing. i still love my wife. i still think about we everyday. and i wish i could go back and fix all of this. but i can't. you never can. life gives you the worst options, and you have to deal with them, or die. it's one feeling knowing that someone died because if you, it's a whole other, morbid feeling to know that it your own son. and that of a toddler. 

though i shed many tears as i wrote this, it feels so amazing to just scream it all. the weight of this will only be lifted when i take my final breath. but only with the support of my remaining son, and my will to live, i will remain. thank you all for reading.

"i stopped my mom from suicide with cookies and water. i don't know if this is the right sub for this, but i have literally told no one, and the thought came back to me tonight. 

i was around 10 at the time, and i was pretty dumb. me and my sister were home alone because my dad and mom went to the bar to have some drinks. about 4 hours after they left, my mom comes home in an uber.

she storms upstairs, and is crying insanely hard. i have only seen her cry one other time, and it was about a movie.

my sister said hi to my mom, but she didn't respond because of how upset she was. my sister got mad when she didn't respond and made things even worse for her. i just looked out my door and did nothing.

when i walked into her room to ask what was happening, she was on the bed crying and responded with: ""nothing. nows not the time.""

i really could tell that there was something wrong, but the least i could do was bring her something to drink or eat

i went downstairs to the kitchen and got a cookie and some water. when i went back upstairs, and into her room, she had a nooce laying on the bed. i remember seeing it but not thinking to much of it.

i handed the water and cookies to her, and she just stopped crying for a couple of seconds. she looked at me and then looked at the snacks. she put them down and said: ""thank you ~my name~."" 

i'm almost certain that she was mad because my dad either hooked up with another girl, or was mean to her because my dad has anger issues.

i also think that she was about to attempt suicide, but just cookies and water made her stop from suiciding. 

i'm almost 14 now, and she's doing really good now. she smiles everyday and has gotten really involved in church and loves her bible study group. my dad is also doing better now, and he is learning to respect my mom more for what she is.

i like to think that her feeling when i gave her the cookies was that: ""if i left this world, i'm leaving so much behind me. people will miss me.""

so about 2 years ago when i was 15, my grandma helped me setup a stock account  under her name because i was interested in stocks. i deposited more money into the account over the years, totaling about $700. i've been messing with pennystocks the entire time and while i had some bad losses,i've made a very good profit. i'm not going to specify but the account is worth several tens of thousands now. 

last week i was visiting my grandma and she asked me how the stock account was going (i don't visit her very often and shes never asked before), and she was shocked when i told her how much i made. she suddenly told me that it was in her name, it was her account, and it was her money. i was super confused but we got into an argument and i ended up leaving. i've talked to my parents and they talked to her about it, and apparently they got into an argument too. 

she is insisting that the money is hers, the account is under her name but i put all of the money in it, and did all the trades under the impression that she was letting me use an account under her name, then we'd change the account to my name when i turned 18. i am now 17, turning 18 in 7 months. 

yesterday i got an email that the bank account was changed and i checked and all the money was gone. i don't know how she got it because she didn't know the password, i'm guessing she contacted support or something?

because i recently discovered his reddit account and his post history on here is extremely worrying to me. on a post with a gif of a young teen girl doing an acrobatic exercise he commented how she was a ""beautiful, cute nymphet"" and then proceeded to argue with another user about how it was ""perfectly natural to be attracted to girls that age"". on a post in a porn subreddit one user said how the girl ""looked 13"" and he replied something along the lines of ""i know, right? so hot. wish more adult women had her built."" and more, comments about how he thinks young teen girls are hot.

&#x200b;

i don't know what the right term is and i don't really care, for me being attracted to girls that age is definitely pedo territory and it makes him a massive creep in my opinion. now i don't want to stay with him any longer, obviously i'll break up with him, should i just do so without telling him the reason or should i tell him that i'm disgusted that he's such a creep and is trying to justify his sick desires online? another thing i've wondered about is whether i should let others know. he doesn't work with children or teenagers but for instance he has friends who have younger sisters around that age and maybe he's not the kind of person they'd like to keep around.

"update overheard my boyfriend 26m admitting that his ex is hotter than me 27f.. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ao749k/overheard_my_boyfriend_26m_admitting_that_his_ex/?st=jry9hdym&sh=ff7a4e1c)

thanks for all your responses, they helped me so much.

yesterday morning, i texted him with the reasons why i found his words to be so hurtful, thinking he'd my message and apologize. however, i should have known that he'd just ignore me.

he left me on read for the whole of yesterday and today. finally, at night, he texts me to say that he's been really busy at work the past couple of days. then he was like ""can i be honest with you? i'm really not feeling this, so lets end it. been on the fence about it for some time but after our fight i knew that this wasnt right."" 

thats it. he already unfollowed me on instagram and unfriended me on facebook. i was venting to a friend (incidentally, his coworker) and she told me that he was kind of bummed out all day because he found out his ex got a new boyfriend. 


this honestly sucks. i actually felt like we had something. but i should have seen the red flags in hindsight, of which there were many. i get it though. dude dated a beautiful fashion model for 5 years, how can he go back to being with a normal woman. but unless he knows any other models, i guess we mere mortals will have to do.

tl;dr: bf ignored my messages after the fight, then he texted to break up with me. ",7

"called cps to investigate my brother and sister in law.. my brother in law, sister in law and 8 year old niece all live in a 2 bedroom house that i remember as once being an older, but nice home. over the last several years, i'm not sure exactly what happened but they just... stopped caring about it. 

i wouldn't worry so much if it was just messy. but the house is filthy to a point that it's got to be unsanitary. their 2 dogs use the bathroom in the house and it doesn't get cleaned up.  the pantry is full of rat feces and various chewed up packaging for different pantry foods. the smell is unbelievable. it's so bad that it's unbearable even from outside if the door is open. the air conditioning vents are packed with dog hair... the fur is everywhere really. 

the shower head in the master bathroom broke about 5 years ago. instead of just replacing it, they stopped using it. not the shower. the entire bathroom. now it's just full of dirty clothes, trash and dog waste. over time, the toilet and shower have gotten stained and filthy. they don't bother cleaning it because... well, why bother?  they don't use it. instead, they all use their daughter's bathroom (also absolutely filthy). 

the oven and stove broke a few years ago as well. they just stack their mail on top of it and cook with the microwave or toaster oven. most of the time they just eat out. 

3 years ago, a leak in the air condition caused a large part of the ceiling in my niece's playroom to cave in. a year later, the room and all her toys were still covered in mud, dirt and insulation. 

my husband and i have tried to help. we fixed the ceiling ourselves. we have them money to fix the oven but they never fixed it. i have gone over to their house several times and cleaned it as well as i could manage, but a week or two later it would always end up being disgusting again. 

they're not impoverished. they both work well paying jobs. they shop often and eat out at expensive restaurants. their daughter was in gymnastics and doing very well, but they pulled her out this year because they ""couldn't afford it.""

my niece stays with us every few months or so. we have kids her age and we love having her here. she's always sent with an inhaler and breathing treatments due to asthma, but i've never needed to use them. at her house, she constantly struggles to breathe. 

her parents both have issues with alcohol and prescription pills. 

the other day, a mutual friend called and said she went to visit the other day and had to walk right back outside to vomit. the smell is that bad. 

so i decided i was done. i've tried to help. i've talked to them a thousand times. but ultimately, i care more about my niece's health and safety than her parent's feelings. 

so i called cps and told them everything.

"by spending $300 on laundry.. **this is super cluttered and it stresses me out so i made a new post for the update:**

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9kuza2/tifu_by_spending_300_on_laundry_update/?





for reference, i'm a 27 yr old chick who is not at all rich. i grew up middle class with a very simple family. right now, i'm traveling for work for a few weeks, so naturally i expected to do laundry at some point. i figured most hilton's have guest laundry so this shouldn't be a problem. 

as i'm checking in i ask the front desk, ""do you have guest laundry or like, quarter laundry nearby?"" 

he goes on to tell me they don't have quarter laundry but their hilton does have guest laundry. i'd just leave my shit with him and they'd have it done by that evening. 

me, being the simpleton i am, thinks it's complimentary. to be fair, he should have mentioned it cost a lot of money. i mean, based on my reaction alone, that should've been some indicator that i was not the type to drop hundos on fucking laundry. christ, i just asked where the local laundromat was. of course i don't have that sort of money. plus, after he said that, i literally jerked my head back and was like, ""really? how does that work?"" and proceeded to have a lengthy conversation on how nice it was they did that and how i never did anything like that before and felt so fancy. not once did he mention cost. even after i dropped off my huge bag of crumpled up laundry he didn't say a word. hindsight, of course it cost money. but to me, in that moment, it sounded like they just did complimentary laundry for their guests. i figured most people didn't use the service since they typically just stayed at the hotel a night or two. it was probably used mostly by few people like me who traveled for work. maybe i'm dumb, but still. he should have mentioned a cost. 

so i go about my day. get back to the hotel. get my laundry and thank the girl. the guy i had talked to before was gone now and it was a new person. as i'm leaving she says, ""i'll just add the cost to your room."" 

i'm taken aback but it happens so fast that i just smile and nod and go to my room. the entire walk up i'm replaying her words in my head. cost? what cost? it wasn't until i got to my room that i started to panic. i raced right back downstairs and asked what she meant by that. she explained that it cost money to do the laundry service. they charged by clothing item and my total was $300 and some change!! the real fucking kicker is that they didn't even wash nice clothes. among the laundry was my nasty cut off sleeves gym work out shirt and gym shorts, and my nasty hole-ridden work out socks. it was weird seeing those hung up like they were a goddamn ball gown. 

now, i was raised to be polite, so i made sure to tell her i'm not at all mad at her since it's not her fault, but what the fuck???  i'm proud to say i kept my composure the entire time, but i felt like crying. i still sort of do. she gave me the number to her manager, and i sent him an email yesterday afternoon. he works on monday, so i'm definitely going to stop in and see if there is anything they can do to wipe that charge or discount it. i travel a lot for work so i have a crap ton of hilton honors points. enough for a two night stay in a nice hotel. i'm hoping i can just trade that in or *something.* my job definitely doesn't cover that cost, and i most certainly don't have that kind of dough. not sure what i'm going to do. if anyone has any suggestions i'd be grateful for help. unless i'm completely fucked.... 

tl;dr - i thought guest laundry was complimentary. it is, in fact, not. got a $300 bill when i could've just spent five bucks in quarters doing my own damn laundry. 


**update**

this isn't a super exciting update, but i thought i'd keep you all in the loop. i received an e-mail early this morning from one of the managers at hilton in reply to the frantic e-mail i sent after the ""incident."" she is ""happy to work with me on the balance"" but i don't quite know what this means yet as the e-mail was pretty vague. could be anything from a full refund, to knocking ten dollars off, or a voucher, or something like that. she also asked me what amount i could pay towards the $300 bill. 

in my head, i was like *""uhhhh how bout free-fifty yo,""* but i realized that getting away with paying a reduced rate is more than fair and she was super generous to even offer that. realistically, if i can get this down to $50, i'd be happy. i mean, i'd be happy with anything at all, but 50 bones would allow me to rest easy at night. 

so i decided to reply. 

i thought about it, and instead of listing a number i'd contribute toward the total, i chose to give her a more detailed account of what had happened. you see, email number one was written when i was tweaking out on adrenaline after this all originally transpired. i didn't do a good job of explaining how i was mislead, or how i didn't fill out any forms, and instead sounded like some frantic teenage girl who'd just gotten her first speeding ticket. so i pretty much shared the story that i did with you all, but spiffed it up with some grown-up words. at the end, i said something along the lines of, ""in regards to how much i can pay toward the $300 bill--i was prepared to spend $5 in quarters for my laundry that afternoon (haha). i'm willing to work with you on the price, but i am unable to spend anywhere near $300 for laundry.""

that's good right?! i have no idea as i'm horrible at this sort of thing. i'm so bad at balancing politeness with sternness; i always lean toward to nice, so when i try to be stern i either am not stern enough or am like winston from new girl and take it too far. i hate complaining and causing problems!! but i hate being out $300 dollars more, so i bit the bullet. anyway, i sent that e-mail maybe five hours ago. my original plan was to go to the hotel this afternoon and sort this out, but since i'd received that e-mail, i thought i'd hold off to see if we could solve it that way. if i don't hear back by tomorrow afternoon, i will definitely go down there after work. i held off because i felt like marching down there hours after getting an e-mail was a bit aggressive. i'm in houston for the week (staying at a different hotel) so it's no trouble for me to make the trip.

anyway, that's what's up!! i'm hoping she just e-mails me this afternoon, and i can be done with all this drama. shout out to all the redditors who offered to help me pay the bill. that's insanely nice of you and it fills me with joy to know there are such kind strangers in this world. however, i could never accept payment from strangers for my own fuck up. 


thanks for all the support and advice!! i really appreciate it.

"i (21 m) am unsure whether to breakup with my girlfriend (21 f) over marriage concerns. i'll try and keep this short, or as short as is possible with these kind of things.

so me and my girlfriend have been dating for ~ 2 years now, we complement each other well and are very loved up. our relationship has had its peaks and troughs, as is normal with any, but there's always been this wholesome, unfettering love through thick and thin. 

we've always talked about longevity and our future in a sort of daydreamy way. however, recently it's become more of a serious conversation and it's quickly transpired that it's very unlikely that we will be ""together forever"".

the crux of the issue is that we are different religions. i'm not a religious person really so i don't really care, but she feels her religion is a strong part of her identity (although she is not that religious herself) and has made it clear that she wants to raise her kids as such (and will not compromise on this). 

the problem with this is that my parents are very religious and my relationship would never be the same with them if i did raise my kids like that. it would ruin them, to be frank. the only people i love more than my girlfriend are my parents (and my brother), so estranging myself from them isn't something i'd consider really.

she recognises all this, and accepts that it's highly unlikely we will be together forever— i.e. it's not impossible but it is extremely improbable. 

the issue i'm having is that despite the fact that we are so young (with marriage being at least 5+ years away), i don't know how i could stay with someone that i was probably only going to be with temporarily? her viewpoint is that we should value the time we have together, as much as it may be, and make the most of it, together - even if we only have a couple of years she has made it clear she'd much rather take that over nothing since she loves me so much.


i, on the other hand, am really having trouble reconciling/justifying a temporary relationship in my mind. i wish i thought like her, i really do, since it would make things so much easier. 

realistically, at 21, marriage talk is so early, but most couples will assume there is a decent ish chance they will stay together forever, rather than thinking eh i expect this to last a couple more years then we'll probably break up. 




tl:dr

boy and girl have religious differences meaning marriage is likely impossible. girl wants to stay with boy for as long as she can despite this, boy not sure if he can stay if relationship is likely only temporary.



i'm at a loss for what to do, could anyone provide some advice? it would be much much appreciated.

edit:
i've slowly been making my way through all the replies, giving each careful thought and consideration - i appreciate every single one of them and will get to replying to them as i can. one thing i wanted to clarify that has cropped up a lot is my statement regarding loving my brother and parents more than my girlfriend. i just wanted to clarify that once i am married i plan on loving my wife and children more than anyone else in the world, my family will be my number one priority.",7
"most weddings are an expensive waste of time.. most people in america go all out when they get married. the best dress, expensive venue, cocktails for everyone and 5 dance floors for all those passive aggressive in-laws.


but seriously... wtf does a wedding achieve? if you actually love someone, can't you get married in private or with some close family/friends?


even then, weddings are a dangerous idea in today's economy. you better be fucking bill gates' daughter if you're having a wedding these days. student loans, the housing market, casualisation of work, redundancies everywhere... there's so much instability. if you stopped to think about it, you'd soon realise that you actually can't afford a wedding. most people realistically can't.


and as for being a waste of time, well... remind me of the guess list again? oh yes, those in-laws and facebook fiends who you haven't talked to in 5 years. do you seriously think they actually want to be there? are they your *real* friends?


just stop wasting everyone's time and money, and quietly get married together. if you truly loved each other, then that should be all you need, minus the wealth signalling shit show. ",6
"a veterinarian's perspective on personal finance and your pets. most vets are pretty bad at personal finance (we apparently think an average student loan debt of $170k and a starting salary of 60k is a good idea..) but as i lurk here quite a bit i've seen a few posts with questions about veterinary bills, insurance, etc so i thought i'd share some of my thoughts from behind the scenes.


first off, yes, veterinary bills are expensive. do bear in mind that vets are actually expected to provide modern medicine at a fraction of the cost of human medicine, even when the procedures are the same or similar. 


that being said, part of the reason that veterinary bills aren't more marked up is that the vast majority of the time, payment is expected at time of service. routinely you will be asked to leave a deposit of 50% of the estimate if you are hospitalizing your pet, and then pay the rest when h/she is discharged. i hear this advice tossed around here a lot, ""ask for a **payment plan**. most vets do payment plans"". i have worked at practices in four states and i have never seen a vet clinic that routinely offered payment plans. 


the truth is that many vet clinics are small businesses that are not set up to offer payment plans. if they didn't get paid, they couldn't keep their doors open. they would need whole separate staff to administer payment plans, plus eat the cost of clients who bailed on their payments. this would likely drive up costs for the rest of the clients. other clinics belong to a few nationwide corporations, and they've probably even stricter about not offering plans as a part of corporate policy. the few times i've seen payment plans were exceptions for trusted long-term clients, or a few cases that slipped through the cracks and we didn't have any other option. 


there are **wellness plans**, which are a completely different animal and do not address medical care for sick pets. 


the exception is that the vast majority of clinics do accept **carecredit** and highly encourage you to apply for it in case of emergency. you do need to have decent credit to qualify. if you don't qualify on your own, consider co-applying with a parent or family member. make sure to pay your carecredit bill in full before the promotional interest-free term is up, (there is no penalty for early payment), or you will be charged interest backdated to the beginning of the loan, which is awful. 


what about **pet insurance**?  there are a lot of pet insurance companies out there, some with good plans, others not so good. i would say that if you have between $3000-5000 in an emergency fund specifically for your pet, then you most likely do not need insurance. some of my clients have ""lucked out"" in the sense that they got insurance for their dog when he/she was a healthy puppy, and then developed some sort of chronic condition that needs multiple tests, follow-up tests, medication, etc, and they submit all of those claims to insurance. i have heard good things about trupanion, which generally pays out 70-90%. i've heard that pet's best provides excellent coverage - 100% after a deductible, but has expensive premiums. in general, though, you will most likely pay more for insurance than you will get out of it. i prefer the $3-5000k emergency fund - that should cover most serious illnesses, emergencies, and surgery (you may need to adjust this upwards if you are in an expensive col city). anything above that and you are probably in referral/specialty territory and may need to explore other options. 


so what are your other **options**? if you are looking at an expensive vet bill that you can't afford to incur, you should always ask your vet if there are other options. we are very used to getting this question. there are a few exemptions where there really only is one treatment, and it is a matter of life and death. generally speaking though, if a client tells us they have financial concerns/constraints, we will try to put together an alternative plan, either one that foregoes some of the diagnostic tests and relies on empirical treatments, or a less intensive treatment plan that still has a reasonable chance of success (outpatient treatment vs hospitalization, for example). if you are at an emergency/specialty center, you will most likely be able to get a less expensive option at a general practice / regular vet if it is appropriate and can wait. if your vet won't give you another option, feel free to seek a second opinion. 


one of my vet school interview questions actually asked me what i would do with a patient who has been hit by a car and has a broken leg, if the owner doesn't have money. this is for illustration purposes, but can be adapted to other situations. what i would say is:


1) ideally, getting the leg fixed by a surgeon


2) if that's not an option, amputation of the leg is much less expensive and can be performed by most general practitioners


3) if that's not an option, consider surrendering your pet. some humane societies/animal shelters, depending on their resources, will take in pets with injuries or conditions that can be treated if they will still be adoptable pets with a good quality of life. everywhere i have worked, almost all the doctors and nurses have at least one pet that they got in a situation like this. sometimes they have connections with rescue groups as well. 


4) humane euthanasia. i love pets. i think they're family. but do i think that only people with $3-5k to drop on their dog should be allowed to have pets? no. shit happens. there are lots of dogs and cats that live their whole lives without anything major happening; i only have to see them for routine vaccines. but if something terrible does happen, sometimes euthanasia is the best or our only option. we can take comfort in the fact that we gave a pet a good, loving home, and prevented them from needless suffering and neglect.


so on from that depressing topic. what are some things you can do at home to make sure your pet is the healthiest and avoids many preventable vet bills?

**preventative health care**


1) keep your pet at a healthy body weight. if you think your pet might be fat, they probably are. more helpfully, here is a body condition chart for cats: https://www.wsava.org/sites/default/files/body%20condition%20score%20chart%20cats.pdf
and dogs: https://www.wsava.org/sites/default/files/body%20condition%20score%20chart%20dogs.pdf


keeping them lean is about 99.9% diet.. i've heard so many times this winter, ""oh well he's fat because of the weather, we aren't walking as much"". then reduce his meal portions accordingly! this actually costs *less* money. can't say the same for any other medical treatment/advice. it doesn't matter how much exercise your dog gets if there's a never ending bowl of food available for him. i recommend feeding two portioned meals a day. preventing obesity reduces the risk of musculoskeletal injury, arthritis, diabetes, cancer, urinary tract problems etc. 


2) brush your dog's teeth! especially if they are a smaller breed, or one of the poster children for bad teeth: dachshunds, chihuahuas, yorkies.. bigger dogs seem to get away with less dental care, whether it's because their teeth fit better in their jaws, genetics or that they usually enjoy chewing on things that mechanically cleans their teeth. either way, i recommend at least regularly examining your dogs teeth, especially the ones in the back. daily (or at the very least every other day) toothbrushing is the most effective way to prevent plaque and tartar buildup, and save thousands in dental bills over the course of your dog's life.


edit: yes, you should also brush your cat's teeth, if possible. probably best to start when they're young!
 

if you don't have a pet yet, seriously consider rescuing rather than buying. purebred dogs are incredibly overpriced and a lot of them tend to have health problems that mixed breeds don't. purebred dogs from puppy mills/pet stores are the worst: birth defects from inbreeding, parasites, infections, etc.. if you have your heart set on a puppy, shelters regularly have puppies up for adoption, and will have already been fixed, which saves you a $300-500 surgery, and had a bunch of vaccines. if you have your heart set on a purebred, do research what their common health problems are and make sure you are equipped to deal with them.  



second edit: another money saver: it's always fine to ask for a written prescription for your pet's medications, or ask to have it called in to a human pharmacy if sold there. you can check certain websites to see what the prices of the medication would be. if the med isn't listed, it's probably a veterinary-only drug that must be sold through the vet. as far as online pharmacies, i have mixed feelings about them. they are not necessarily subject to the same regulations as brick and mortar pharmacies. their products may not be covered by the  manufacturer's guarantee. some of the products we've seen on there -- their manufacturers actually only sell direct to veterinarians, so those products are either stolen or counterfeit. i have no problem with saving clients money by writing prescriptions to  be filled elsewhere, but i am a little leery of the online ones.

"by not checking my shorts before putting them on.. background - my lady love (ll) and i live in a house built in the early 1900's with mostly original everything, including the sliding no screen having windows.  we typically only crack the windows or put in temporary screens when fully open due to not wanting the cat to get out.  further, while sleeping i'm typically in the buff unless we have visitors over - story time!

talk about an amazing weekend... the northwest weather has been treating us well lately.  saturday we went golfing, rode bikes to go eat and play some pinball, then basically enjoyed each other's presence for the remainder of the day.  sunday morning was starting off no different.  looking forward to a quick walk and talk over some caffeine then commencing with our normal costco run and likely some yard work, etc.

time to get up!  after handling some normal morning routines i head to the bedroom while ll finishes her routine in the bathroom.  i try to respect the neighbors by putting on some clothes while walking around downstairs with the blinds open.  the first thing i see are my adidas basketball shorts from the early years (these things are over 15 years old and still going strong - love em!).  i pick them up, put them on, then hop on the bed and decide to take a tour of reddit.... here we go.....

not 10 seconds later i feel that initial sensation you get when an itch creeps up, but on the base of the head of my dick.  (this all feels like slow motion)  i reach down to itch it and from the time i start moving my hand to the time i reached my dick the feeling went from itch to fire..  so instead of itching i pulled my dick out to observe for any visual signs of concern.  i didn't really see anything... the pain is increasing!!

at this point i throw my shorts off and as soon they hit the ground i hear ""bzzzzzzzzzzzzzbbzbzz"".   

me: ""babe!!!!""  

ll runs in asking what's wrong. 

me:  ""i think a bee or wasp stung my dick!""

ll:  ""wth do you mean a bee or wasp stung your dick!?!""

i pointed at the buzzing shorts.  after regaining a bit of my composure i hammer fisted the shorts and confirmed that yes, yes in-fact a wasp was in my shorts and stung my dick.  

let me say one thing, i consider myself a fairly intelligent person but ll out does me here and in many other areas.. it's one of the main reasons i adore this lady.  either way, aside from being a smarty pants ll doesn't handle high stress situations very well.  at this point my eyes are bugged out and she can tell i'm a bit concerned about my dick.  she grabs her phone and googles ""wasp sting dick"".  really.... anyways, she ends up finding stories about other people's dick's getting stung and is laughing... she's lost god damn site of the mission.  

me:  ""babe.... maybe just look up wasp sting treatment""

ll:  ""ohhhhhh yeahhhhhhh - sorry""

wasp treatment - clean with soap, treat with vinegar for 15 min, and then ice.

cleaning with soap - check!  ll brings me a glass of white wine vinegar....

ll: ""to soak your dick....""

i have to walk into the office and close the door because i'm so damn embarrassed that i'm soaking my dick in a good drinking cup full of vinegar.  15 minutes pass and i go shower.  pain is all but gone and there is no swelling.

as i sit here typing this up i can still smell the vinegar on my finger and can only imagine how bad my dick smells.  this little bastard isn't going to ruin my day; i have his corpse in a sandwich baggy and he will be going with us to costco and our other adventures.  this is just in case my dick swells to the size of a grapefruit or something.

anyway, a few days ago i got home from work and was wanting to edit one of the decks i had built for the tournament later in the day. i go to pick up a few deck boxes and a binder and found that one of my binders, and 3 of 9 deck boxes were missing. i immediately freak out because i have them all very organized and well-kept. my nephew has **a lot** of behavioral issues and gets in a lot of trouble both at home and school. he also isn't ever really disciplined because it would make the situation worse(you'd understand if you met him and my family). so i go into his room to look for them. lo and behold, there they are, scattered all over the floor, most of them taken out of sleeves, some bent, some of them was thrown in his backpack—oh and my binder was completely empty. at this point i was *beyond* furious and all i could mutter was "" oh my god"" over and over. 

after i pick everything up that i could find, i go upstairs and casually bring him back down to his room and then start screaming at him, and demanding him to find the rest of them. he kept saying he didn't do it and he didn't steal them, that they were in his room when he woke up and he thought they were his (keep in mind he lies about *everything*). so i get even madder if that's possible and i smack the shit out of his leg. then he starts screaming bloody murder and my nstep dad comes down and demands to know what's going on. i couldn't even get a word out before the child went up to him and said i was trying to kill him. my nstep dad coddles him and then gets in my face and threatens to beat me to death if i ever lay another finger on him. 

after they question him for about an hour, he finally admits that he took them to school and was trading and giving them away with his classmates. his punishment: a stern warning and no tv for the night (which he screamed and cried over). he also said he hates me and wished i would just move out and die. my parents then berated me for a while and essentially told me that i'm a child abuser and if i did that again they would have to call the police and have me charged with assault (mostly my nstep dad saying this, my mom understood what i did and didn't make it a big deal). all in all i recovered most of the cards losing about 20 out of 250, but with all of the damage that was done to some of the cards i probably lost about $180 of cards. 

so am i the asshole in this situation? was i overreacting by disciplining him because my parents don't? i get that it's not my place to do that, but i completely think that it was deserved and i honestly feel that i should've smacked him again. he goes back to school today and i have already contacted his teacher and explained the situation; thankfully, she's going to confiscate every pokemon card she finds and let me come in after hours to find which ones are mine. sorry for the lengthy post but i needed to vent my frustrations. aita? 

tldr: nephew went in my room and stole approximately 250 valuable cards while i was working; i get home and find out and i smack the shit out of him. then i'm threatened to be killed/ be turned into the police for assault the next time i put my hands on him. 

edit: holy shit my inbox 
and to clear up a few things:

nstepdad means narcissistic stepdad which is a term from /r/raisedbynarcissists

"for demanding that my girlfriends gymnastics routine be less ""sexy?"". i truly want an honest opinion so i'm going to include all details i can w/in char limit, even ones that aren't flattering to me. 

i've been dating my gf for about a month. honestly i feel much stronger about her than she does me, but i'm hoping she comes around. she is on our university gymnastics team and is an incredible athlete. i went to her meet this afternoon and was freaking shocked to see how much of her floor routine had ""sexual"" elements. she did her routine to ""p'on da replay"" and as an example she crawled on all fours, she shook her ass, she did this thing where she went up and down her body with her finger (including her breasts) and then acted like her finger was sizzling. and during all this, her teammates cheered. i was blown away that this sort of sexuality was not only allowed but encouraged. 

after the meet i told her i didn't think she should do that sort of stuff. she told me that it was normal for gymnastics and that her routine had been worked out for years with coaches and choreographers. i told her it was normal for strippers who danced for dollar bills. she told me i didn't get it. i told her that i didn't understand what was to get, i was her boyfriend and it was my job to look out for her. she told me ""you are literally and asshole and way overstepping your bounds!"" i told her that i didn't want to fight and she said it was too late. so instead of her going on a romantic date i had planned, she decided to hang out with her teammates. i am so upset because i was counting on seeing her tonight. 

based on what she said, am i the asshole for thinking her routine should be less sexy and telling her so?",3

"my great aunt believed the scam where the irs calls and demands payment in itunes cards. the cashier was suspicious of an elderly woman purchasing so many and called the police. the cashier was fired the next day for costing her workplace a purchase.. my location is florida. apologies if this is an obvious question, i am not familiar with the law in any way and have no idea about the legality of this.

my 70 year old great aunt got a call from the ""irs"" saying she owed them money or she would be arrested. they said she had to pay them in gift cards asap. of course this is a well known scam but my great aunt believed it (we've since told her about how these scams work and she knows now to call one of her kids if she gets a call asking for money or personal information). my great aunt went out and tried to purchase hundreds of dollars in itunes gift cards. the cashier got suspicious of an elderly woman buying so many for so much, especially after my great aunt couldn't tell her what itunes was. the cashier knew what was going on and called the police and got my great aunt to call a family member. my great aunt did not buy any gift cards or lose any money.

the next day my cousin went to thank the cashier but she was not in and the manager told my cousin she had quit. another employee approached my cousin in the parking lot and said the cashier was actually fired. my cousin left his number with the employee and the cashier later called him. she was terminated the day after she helped my great aunt. the reasons in her termination letter (which i have seen) were ""acting outside her authority as an employee"" and ""actions causing /company's name/ to lose a transaction or purchase"" due to an incident on /date she helped my aunt/. her manager verbally told her it was for ""stopping that old lady from spending $700""

my family is angry on her behalf. she's only in her early 20s and is working full time to help her family while going to college part time at night. she was denied unemployment because she was fired for cause. my family would help her but we are not well off by any stretch. was it even legal for her company to fire her for helping save a person from being scammed? does she have any means to contest this?

"former apartment management sends me a bogus bill. what do i do?. so my former apartment management has sent me a bill for carpet cleaning and professional cleaning. i can understand the professional cleaning although i left the place spotless it could just be protocol. however, the carpet cleaning is bullshit because i left the brand new carpet in brand new condition. it was just me without any animals, i am positive that the carpet was flawless. how should i proceed?

"by hilariously ruining sex with my girlfriend. for background: i'm (30s/m) in a 7+ year relationship with my gf (30s/f). we've been having a bit of a dry spell lately, so the gf decided to spice things up by buying a remote controlled vibrator. when i came home from work yesterday, she surprised me at the door by handing me the remote control and telling me she had it inserted, and to play around with it however i wanted. we then had a lovely dinner of different fancy cheeses and meats with bread. while we ate i would occasionally reach under the table and push the button to change settings. by the end of dinner we were both quite aroused, and she hopped on my lap and started grinding against me, ready to move things to the bedroom...

aaaaand this is where things began to go wrong. i work a high pressure job with long hours and hadn't had time to eat anything at work all day that day. i had eaten voraciously during dinner, and probably ate a good half a pound of various cheeses. i started to feel a little nauseous while she was grinding up on me, and said i might need a moment to digest. she wasn't having any of it, and insisted we head to the bedroom. so i figured fuck it, we'll just do it live.

in the bedroom she lays down and asks me to hop on top. meanwhile, the vibrating insertable is going full tilt. the noise it was making was an alternating ""waaahhh-eeeeee"" pause. ""waaahhh-eeeeee"" pause. ""waaahhh-eeeeee"" pause.. but this thing is like 90% buried inside her, so the sound is coming out a little muffled and distorted. and i swear all i could think of at that moment was how it sounded exactly, spot on, like the robot from the movie wall-e screaming for help, terrified, buried alive. i burst out laughing as she looks at me in bewilderment. this kills the mood and causes the nausea i was feeling moments before to hit a crescendo. after i explain both what i was laughing about and why i suddenly looked so sick, she starts laughing, which makes it even harder for me to stop laughing, nausea getting worse every second.

finally we both calm down. she steps out to give me a moment to get over the sick stomach feeling and for her to remove the toy. a few minutes pass, then she comes back in. im on my back still feeling profoundly queasy, but tell her i'm ready to go! she hops on top, starts making out with me, then starts going at it in cowgirl. as the thrusting gets more and more intense, she was getting really close to orgasm as i was getting closer and closer to throwing up. finally as she was jjjjust about ready, she brought her face close to mine during one particularly violent thrust, causing one of the foulest burps i've ever had to escape. i taste cheese mixed with shame as she throws herself off of me, yelling, gagging, and laughing hysterically at me. i feel terrible but can't help but laugh, which only makes the nausea worse. at that moment i was about as close to throwing up as you can get without actually doing it. she leaves the room still laughing but utterly disappointed. i just lay there aroused, sick to my stomach, and frustrated at myself for eating like a goldfish during dinner.

there were no further attempts at sex that night.

tl;dr  wall-e combined with too much cheese ruined sexy times",4

"for letting a dementia patient add me to her will?. i was part of a meals on wheels program for community service in high school and met this wonderfully sweet old woman who didn't have any family nearby. 

we had a lot in common, i had been considering a career in social work, she didn't have any family nearby, and i didn't have any living grandmothers so we became fast friends. 

she developed dementia and towards the end i basically moved in with her and cared for her in exchange for free rent in her home and groceries. (it was also out of my love for her, but i couldn't have afforded to care for her full time if i also had to make rent.) 

she died and it was heartbreaking but i also saw firsthand how she was suffering in the final days, so it was bittersweet. 

she divided her will among her children and i equally. i did not ask her to do this, i never asked her about the contents of her will and the one time we briefly discussed it all we discussed was the house, not her savings. 

she left me 80k and change, and the same amount to her two children. a remarkable gesture and life changing for me, obviously. 

her children are contesting the will because she apparently added me in around the same time her dementia began to rear it's ugly head. they insist she was confused and had mistakenly come to believe i was one of her children and that even if she hadn't mistaken me to be one of her children, that she was not in her right mind when she did this so the will should be invalid. 

i am very conflicted as to my responsibility here.  i would obviously very much like to keep the money but i don't want to let how life changing the money would be cloud my judgment. i don't need it so badly that it would be worth doing wrong by her or her kids. 

am i the asshole?

"for letting a girl believe regular brownies were ""weed brownies"" and letting her make a fool of herself all night in front of our friends?. so there's this girl in my friend group. she has a tendency to be kind of over the top and stretches the truth a lot. we all were hanging out over the weekend to celebrate another friend's birthday. apparently a few people had the idea to give her ""pot brownies"" and see how she'd react. the catch is that they had nothing in them at all. but they were banking on her acting high anyway to fit in with everyone else. 

i didn't find out about this whole plan until i got there. everyone else pretended to be high and so did the girl, predictably. i didn't participate in that part but i also didn't tell her it was all a huge joke at her expense. 

at the end of the night someone told her and called her out on always being fake. she got really upset and ended up leaving the party early by herself. i do feel bad for her but i also feel like she kind of brings this on herself sometimes because she's always trying too hard. 

again though, this wasn't my prank and i probably wouldn't have planned something like this myself. but it is what it is now.

"porn is the biggest cancer to society today.. i know this is going to be very unpopular, but porn is fucking **terrible** for every person involved, whether it's the directors, actors or consumers. 

*well, now that i think about it, the directors are pretty fucking well off, if you can get over the fact that their job is being a professional cuckold.*

first off, **the actors** (or pornstars)

it's a well known fact that people trying to become pornstars are manipulated into doing things they don't want to do, and even when they have made it in the porn game, they're still forced to do crazy shit on occasion. obviously this isn't the case for every single person, but it's still extremely common.

secondly, **the consumers** (you and me)

the effect that daily porn use has on the brain is fucking incomprehensible. first off, it makes you conditioned to get off watching somebody else fuck the person that you want to be fucking. which is called being a cuckold. 

another effect is the easy rewards system involved. all you have to do to get one of the biggest dopamine rushes possible is by typing in like 15 characters into your browser. it rewards laziness and seriously fucks up your brains ability to produce dopamine. instead of going out and doing something fun with friends, or doing a good deed to get dopamine, just go watch some people fuck.

i used to have awful d*pr*ssion (the sub doesn't let me talk about the actual word), and a friend recommended that i stop watching porn and masturbating for a while, and holy shit. i stopped feeling numb and grey, and obviously i still had problems, but after only like a week, i started getting pleasure from little things again. music started to sound *really* good again and i stopped being such a moody dick to people.

now that my testimony's over, i'll end with this: porn is the biggest cancer to society, and it mentally and physically fucks (get it) everybody involved in the whole porn ecosystem. internet porn is one of the most destructive inventions of all time.

edit: many of you think i don't know what a cuck is because ""well you don't have a relationship with anybody in pornos, so it's okay"". biologically, it's the same thing. it doesn't matter if you're married to the person getting fucked, because in the end, your brain still wants to fuck that person. and you're watching somebody else fuck them.
 
edit 2: i should've said it's the most accepted poison to society. there are clearly more terrible things like rape, kidnapping, murder, but those are all illegal and looked down upon, while porn is seen as normal.",6

i only say that to take the guilt off some folks. sometimes, it really is just because you don't have enough money. you can cut out everything until there's nothing left to cut out, and you can still not be making enough money. so don't beat yourselves up as much as i have in the past.

"by costing the u.s. navy about 1.5 million dollars.. saw previous posts about costing a company money, figured this belonged here.
sorry for formatting, i'm on mobile.
it's a long one. 

so this wasn't today, this was about 3 years ago. i was working in hazmat on an aircraft carrier. we worked in the hangar bay, and basically distributed and collected hazmat from different departments if they were doing maintenance or painting.
on this day, i had to get giant industrial plastic bags (imagine thickness of painters plastic) for our collection center. these bags are huge, and come in rolls of around 50. probably one lb per bag.
so these rolls are stored in an storage area at the top of the hangar bay, about 30-40 feet off the deck.
i made sure the area was clear of people, and dropped it down from there like i had a million times before.
this is where things fucked up. it went rogue. went sideways, broke a sprinkler activation switch off the wall.
when i came down, the sprinkler system went off. this isn't normal sea water though. this is a hangar bay to handle jets and fuel. we had to have something to smother liquid fires, which is afff (aqueous film forming foam). this stuff is great for smothering liquid fires, but is highly corrosive and is stupid expensive. around 1.5k per gallon. usually it mixes with salt water before leaving the sprinklers, but today the sea water was shut off to this part of the ship. as such, it dumped pure afff. around 600 gallons. it also landed on some expensive pieces of equipment, and downed them for repair.
all in all, i cost the navy approximately 1.5 million in wasted afff and repairs to equipment.

tl;dr broke a sprinkler activator off the wall being dumb, dumping expensive firefighting liquid that is corrosive onto expensive equipment.

edit: have had a lot of people asking about punishment. somehow i got a slap on the wrist. i went to my division officer and told her everything that transpired, somehow she got me off the hook. honestly the most surprising thing that happened in my five years of navy.

the person who directed me to this legal help forum mentioned that it's customary to give updates once significant progress is made in a case. so, since i'm currently sitting in a car, still a couple hundred miles away from home, this is as good a time as any to tell you guys what's been going on. :)

following your advice i contacted the authorities to have the area around the ramp marked out as a no-parking spot. they weren't able to help me since the street is owned by my neighbourhood's homeowner association. now, my house is one of the few in the area that is not part of that organisation, but i decided to contact them anyway. the president turned out to be a wonderful lady who was of immense help to me. she helped resolve the parking situation by designating the area around the ramp as a no-parking spot. i felt bad about inconveniencing my neighbours, but the homeowner association agreed to my idea of extending the street parking zone by a few yards on the other side of my neighbours' house, that way they still have somewhere to park their fifth car. she did all that as a gesture of goodwill without me being a member of their organisation, which made me fall in love with the neighbourhood even more. also, i'm really glad i didn't have to involve the police.

since my accessibility issue has been resolved i've decided to pull the trigger and buy the house i live in. i'm currently in the process of finalising the purchase which is taking slightly longer than usual due to a complex ownership situation, still at this point my estate agent is assuring me that there should be no more roadblocks, which makes me really happy. once i'm the owner of the house i'm planning to join the homeowner association as well. i've also been asked to become their accessibility consultant to help make sure all of their future projects are wheelchair friendly, which is a huge honour to me and makes me confident that this is the right place for me. :)

on top of all that, i've reached an agreement with the homeowner association and two other couples to build a second ramp a little further down the street and split the cost between all of us. every party, including the homeowner association will be covering a quarter of the price and we have a promise that this time a no-parking spot will be marked out immediatelly. :) the project is set to begin once the purchase of my house is finalised.

thanks once again for all your help! what started out as a nuisance has become a fantastic adventure that reassured me that i've found a place i can truly call home!",2
"if you're mixed, you're a white guy just as much as you are a black guy.. i'm a ""light skin black guy."" my mom is greek. my dad is black. like, really black. i'm light skin with the hair of a black man and the nose of a greek man. i know, it's confusing.

pretty much, i always get that i'm black. i always always always get told i'm a light skin black guy. i'm light skin, i'm black. blah blah blah.

the other day someone asked me what i was, because they've never seen a light skin black guy i guess. i told them 'oh i'm a dark skin white guy.' and she laughed, but i was dead fucking serious.

i'm white just as much as i am black. i'm not a light skin black guy, or a dark skin white guy, i'm mixed. i'm mixed race.. aka black and white. 

most of my friends are black and the other day i said to them that i'm also a white guy yk. they all told me to shut my ass up and i was like why the fuck should i??? dude i'm also 50% white. what the fuck? it's literally half of my gene. i'm half black and half white. mixed race. fucking hell.

edit: to people literally private messaging me and asking how i look, i'm just an average guy. my hair is pitch black and i got bright hazel eyes. truly nothing special. i'm only 5'11 for the girl in my dms who just asked me. y'all are crazy frfr lol.",11
"a doctor goes out and buys the best car on the market, a brand new ferrari gto. it is also the most expensive car in the world, and it costs him $500,000. he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light.. an old man on a moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to him.

the old man looks over at the sleek shiny car and asks, ""what kind of car ya got there, sonny?""

the doctor replies, ""a ferrari gto. it cost half a million dollars!""

""that's a lot of money,"" says the old man. ""why does it cost so much?""

""because this car can do up to 250 miles an hour!"" states the doctor proudly.

the moped driver asks, ""mind if i take a look inside?""

""no problem,"" replies the doctor.

so the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.

then, sitting back on his moped, the old man says, ""that's a pretty nice car, all right, but i'll stick with my moped!""

just then the light changes, so the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do.

he floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 150 mph.

suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror – what it could be…and suddenly…

whhhoooooossssshhh!

something whips by him going much faster!

""what on earth could be going faster than my ferrari?"" the doctor asks himself.

he floors the accelerator and takes the ferrari up to 175 mph.

then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped!

amazed that the moped could pass his ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 210 mph.

whoooooooshhhhh!

he's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again!

astounded by the speed of his old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the ferrari all the way up to 250 mph.

not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!

the ferrari is flat out, and there's nothing he can do!

suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his ferrari, demolishing the rear end.

the doctor stops and jumps out and , unbelievably, the old man is still alive.

he runs up to the mangled old man and says, ""oh my gosh! is there anything i can do for you?""

the old man whispers, ""unhook my suspenders from your side mirror.""",0
"my (17m) parents (45f) and (48m) bent me over their knees and spanked me for getting a bad grade on a quiz.. i don't even know where to start unpacking this bullshit. or if this is the right sub for this. 

my parents have always been on the crazier side. super strict military type dad, mom who blindly follows my dads rule. his word is equivalent to that of god's and if it's not followed all hell breaks loose. 

so i'm typically an a-/b+ type student. nothing great but not bad. science (chemistry) has kicked my ass this year so far. it's never been my best subject so whatever. i've gotten by. but i've never gotten less than a b-  and even then my parents grounded me for two weeks. but this past quiz i got a c+. i got it friday afternoon and told them about it saturday morning. you'd have thought i came to tell them i'd murdered someone. dad screaming, mom crying, threats to kick me out, promises i'd amount to nothing. the whole nine yards.

but then they really went off the deep end. my mom was sitting on the couch when all this was happening and my dad was standing to my right. all of a sudden he grabs me (he's 6'2 and muscular, i'm 5'10 and have a runners build, i'm strong but not like him) and pushes me down over my moms lap and starts spanking me. she does nothing, just sits there. he probably hits me about fifteen times before pushing me off her lap onto the ground. he stormed out. my mom continued being a spineless twit on the couch and my ass was stinging like hell. 

wtf do i do here? this was inappropriate and disgusting. the idea of even being in the same room as them again disgusts me.",7
"by not washing anything i own for over a year. so this was an ongoing fuck up that occurred over the past year and a half.  we ran out of laundry detergent and my wife and i separately stopped at the store (we both didn't know the other was stopping) and bought some. (edit: we both bought the same thing) 

so that's the laundry detergent i've been using to wash everything for nearly a year and a half. clothing, towels, sheets etc. all of it. i basically grabbed each bottle of detergent in turn so they both lasted forever 

finally both bottles hit empty about a week ago and i dragged my ass to the store because i needed clean towel. i head to the detergent section and grab the same bottle i've been using for a year an a half (free and gentle. i don't like scented stuff) 

that's when i freeze. because the bottle i'm holding, the same type of bottle i've been using for a year and a half... well i didn't grab it from the detergent section and it didn't say detergent on it.   

no that bottle said fabric softener. not laundry detergent. no soap or cleaning agent that i'm aware of. none.   for a year and a half i've been softening the hell out of my clothing but not actually using detergent. 

i didn't want to believe it.   ran back to the laundry room at my apartment where the trash hasn't been emptied and check the old bottle.   fabric softener. 

i'm in shock. my wife has been complaining about the towels smelling for months and i thought it was in her head (i have a terrible sense of smell anyway but i knew i was washing the towels regularly) turns out i haven't washed those towels with detergent since we bought them.    she wondered why her whites always seemed dingy even when freshly washed.   well now we know.   because fabric softener... 

so now i've been washing everything i own and holy shit what a difference it makes when you actually use detergent. 



tl:dr i used fabric softener instead of laundry detergent for a year and a half, now i feel dirty and have to wash everything in my closet 


edit: a proper tl:dr


edit:   a lot of you are overusing detergent.  check the cap. the fill line for a load is usually a half inch or less above the bottom of the cap, not the top. (i see the irony of me saying this but read the label. it's pretty clear how little you actually need) 

edit3: for fucks sake people, stop telling me to not use fabric softener on towels. i didnt think i was!",4
"i made my father cry. have to start off by saying that my dad is a rock. in a family with a history of mental illness and addiction, he has always been steadfast, never losing his cool, never losing control. he holds the family together. 

and yesterday i made him cry. after being homebound for 3 years, struggling with severe depression and anxiety, i finally got myself a part time job in a children daycare. i got a text from my boss yesterday, because they wanted to commend me for how good i am with the kids, and how happy they are to have me onboard. i read the text aloud to my dad, and he started crying. he hugged me and told me how proud he is of me. the only other time i've seen him cry was when i tried to commit suicide. i feel accomplished and happy for the first time in many years. 

thank you for reading.

"i'm proud of my generation..  i'm 32. right in the middle of the millennial generation. 

you know what? we're awesome. we're dealing with crippling student loans, a horrible job market, a defunct political atmosphere, and a nearly unattainable american dream. older generations shit on us for not succeeding in what they see as the same world they grew up/matured in.  we're lazy/dumb/stupid/entitled, and it's our own fault if we struggle. 

you know what i see? thirty year-olds trying to eke out a living in their own way, working hard while still trying to be socially conscious and environmentally friendly. we were fed the american dream, but it somehow soured before we got a true taste. now we're all behind schedule according to our parents, trying to make families in our 30s and be financially stable in a volatile, unstable world. and yet we're still trying to have fun, trying to be social, trying to cope with a raw deal and still maintain our integrity. 

i'm proud of us. we're doing the best we can with the hand we were dealt, while being the societal scapegoat for other generations.

"for not being able to accept my partner's sexuality?. **update here(https://www.reddit.com/user/confusedbfthrowaway1/comments/bgi725/update_aita_for_not_being_able_to_accept_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) bc i'm apparently not allowed to post them here**

i know how the title of this sounds but please hear me out. also, this is a throwaway bc i'm pretty sure my partner knows my main account and i don't want her to see this. 

about a year ago my (20m) partner (25f) came out to me as polyamorous, and told me that she'd like to begin having sexual relationships with other men. she told me that, for her, it's not a case of wanting to date other people but more to make our relationship an open one where she's free to sleep with others if she wants too. i'm by no means an old fashioned dude - hell i even suggested we try out three ways for this, which she said wasn't the same - but i'm pretty into monogamy and told her that i wasn't necessarily comfortable with the idea of her sleeping with other guys. note: i'm not judging anyone who *is* into this type of relationship, just that it isn't at all for me.

long story short, she got absolutely hysterical about the fact that i told her i was uncomfortable with it, told me how depressed she was not being able to explore her sexuality to the fullest and pointing out how supportive she was of me when i came out as bisexual. i eventually caved and told her okay, but on the conditions that a) she doesn't bring anyone else into our bed and b) i don't have to hear about it in detail. she agreed and got on with finding other guys pretty quickly. she became noticeably happier after she started this, so i've just been kinda grinning and bearing it. 

thing is, she's seemingly become completely disinterested in having a physical relationship with me since she started them with other dudes. i'm not someone who's asking for sex every single night, but at this point i'm lucky if we do it once a month and she never wants to be casually affectionate with me any more. it's gotten to the point where our five year old daughter has noticed, and has asked me why mummy doesn't kiss me goodbye when she goes out any more. it feels like we're just mates who share a bed. conversely, she's going to meet other guys at least once a week and i'm fairly sure she's sleeping with them at least half the time. 

i brought my concerns up to her and she got upset again, saying i had no right to be mad bc she was sticking to my terms and that i was trying to police her sexuality. i'm now in a place where i'm completely torn. as i said, she's noticeably happier when she's exploring her sexuality to the fullest and of course i want her to be happy. and she really was very supportive of me when i came out as bi. but it's really killing me that she seems to not want anything to do with me intimately any more. i get that these guys are probably older and more experienced than i am, but it bums me out that i'm not enough for her. 

so what do y'all think? am i being an arsehole and should i just get over myself and try to learn to accept her more? or am i justified in being upset?

eta: made a comment saying this but people are still asking so i'll post an explanation about how i'm 20 with a 5 year old daughter. when i was a teen i was in a very violent and toxic environment at home. a dude in our building who i would petsit for took pity on me when things got real bad at home and would let me crash on his couch if i needed to get out of my parents' place for a night or two. my now gf was his flatmate and made it apparent she was interested in me, thinking i was ~17 (age of consent in the uk is 16). i didn't turn down her advances because i was a dumb 15 year old who thought banging a hot 20 year old chick would be peak cool. clearly in retrospect this wasn't a good idea, and no she didn't back off when she realised she was wrong about my age (obviously), but that's how that went down for everyone who's curious.",3
"paying parents' bills is crushing me. i'm 23 and my parents had me later in life. both  receive social security (totaling $3,000). since i graduated i've been paying whatever  their ss doesn't cover. i'm losing money paying their bills -i've given them over 10 grand already. i  dont know what  steps they should be taking now and they dont either.
they have about $30,000 in credit card debt and the payments are about $550 a month. at first they thought about moving but i doubt they'll find anywhere cheaper (mortgage is $685 a month plus $210 hoa) . i was dropped from the family health insurance once i graduated but the insurance said they would not lower the per month cost since my brother is still on the plan. this bill is the biggest $921,  but theres car insurance, home insurance, cable (they refuse to drop this and honestly they dont do much but eat and watch tv). 
i have heard people suggest filing for bankruptcy, reverse mortage, my parents  want to do a home equity loan  but at this point that will just go to the credit card bill  and i dont think it will improve anything. we're  in florida if that changes anything. i just feel so out of my depth and i dont know what direction to go in. is there any advice for this situation?  


okay edit: holy shit thank you all for responding. i'm slowly reading through comments, i guess i'll try to answer  some common  stuff up here 
1. i do plan to stop paying, i  set up a budget for them months ago and they didn't cut back or change their lifestyle. this is just so i can offer them with advice. 
2. the scary thing is my  parents do have small part time jobs. mom hasn't worked since i was born, but right now she  pet sits for friends thought that amounts to maybe $50 a month. dad works  at the grocery store and they cut his hours recently so he gets maybe $200 a month.
3. the health insurance said because i was no longer a student i wouldn't be covered so i was sort of forcefully removed from the plan.
4. before i started voluntarily giving them money, my parents were taking money from my brother's account since they had access. they took almost $7000 from him. i dont want him to have to think about any of this, he's 21 and he worked hard to get scholarships and is paying his way through college like i did. so i wont involve him any more. 
4. my dad is 76, mom is 62. he is on medicare but i have no idea how any of that stuff works so when he told me what the bills were at first i just assumed that was already the only option they had. 

when i'm home tonight i'll post concrete numbers of the bills i consistently pay. i have access to their bank account and i send out all the payments after i transfer my money to their account.  
thanks again for all the advice, i feel like an idiot for not  figuring this out sooner but i was just nervous to look into this at all for a while

update:  i am not feeling like a good son (not that i could, its 2018 and y'all assumed my gender). i have an older half sister that i confided in as a result of all this, she lives nearby and wanted to meet with my parents and i to help us plan finances. i told my parents and asked them to come with me. this was a very bad move. lots of drama ensued but this is personal finance not personal drama. parents said bankruptcy is ""morally wrong""  and they will never  use that option. they are going to sign the home equity loan. i told them if that's their choice i can't offer them any more money once i disentangle myself from their bills.  all i can do to help them now is remove myself from their bills. i'm very disappointed in all 3 of us for not being able to work together cooperatively. thank you all for your advice, i just have to worry about my own budget now.",10

"by wearing the wrong underwear to my kids field trip.. everything is in the tl;dr.


this happened yesterday but i'm feeling the repercussions today. 

it started with me getting dressed and just throwing on lace underwear vs cotton. i was just staying home all day so it wasn't a big deal because after my kid leaves for school i walk around naked anyways. 

my kid reminds me that i have volunteered for his field trip and here's a list of kids that i would be watching. 

i forgot so... shit! i don't have a lunch for him or i so i threw jeans on to go run to get a lunch. i figured i could change when i got back no biggie. however... my husband text me asking for me to get some things from the store that had to be picked up immediately. 

i had no time to change and made it to the field trip 10 min late. fine, it's fine. i'll be ok. it's 75degrees, i'm in jeans, lace undies, vagina freshly shaved from the night before. i didn't think much of it. 

there's a lot of walking on this field trip though. i'm keeping up with the 8-9 year olds and i feel my underwear pull up between the lips of my vagina. so half my vagina is rubbing the lace and jeans while i walk. 

i can't fix it at any point and at this age i couldn't just adjust and lie about tucking in my shirt etc. this is the age boobs and ""lady parts"" are a big deal. 

*i did adjust at one point but my lady meat just fell out right away. 

so for three hours my vagina is rubbing against uncomfortable fabric. it's hot so my natural discharge and sweat are making it worse. i can't adjust because the bathrooms are too far away for me to leave the kids and none of the little terds had to go! 

i got home and half my vagina was rubbed raw. my husband said it looked swollen or like a big ingrown hair was forming. 

tl;dr- i shaved my vagina so had no hair buffer when my lady meat fell out of lace undies and chaffed during a three hour walk-a-thon field trip. my vagina lips are swollen and it hurts to be a functioning human.",4

"by summoning a kenyan drug lord on a school trip. yes reddit. its here. for those just joining us, i must again apologise for this took place some time ago.

in my second last year of secondary school i was fortunate enough to participate in a volunteer program in east africa over my summer holidays. the idea was we'd spend a month constructing new classrooms for a struggling school on the coast of kenya, south of mombasa and then work in a safari park (shimba hills iirc) before crossing over to tanzania for an actual safari in ngorongoro crater and then top it off with an ascent of mt kilimanjaro. this wasn't free by the way, i had signed up for it a year before and had participated in loads of fund raising events to make it happen.

we had two teachers accompany us on the trip, mr f who was a no nonsense former royal marine commando as well as mr b who was an absolute legend. mr f's girlfriend also joined us, she wasn't a teacher but she had first aid qualifications. 

mr f utterly despised me and my friends who were, embarrassingly, the sk8r/st0ner contingent of the school, with long hair, band t's, the works. to him we were useless pinheads and he sent us on all the worst jobs on the construction site. mr b was more interested in ordering in crates of kilimanjaro beer and trading albums with me (afi - sing the sorrow for nofx - so long and thanks for all the shoes was probably my favourite swap). i wont digress too much but giving a band of masai mara warriors my cd player later in the trip and watching them do their leaping dances to nofx was awesome.

during our free time we had befriended the local villagers who enjoyed inviting us to their homes for food and trying to sell us trinkets, cigarettes and awful tasting home-brewed coconut wine. eventually the most charismatic villager, a fisherman named sayid stepped up to the plate and offered us some weed. we bought a stick off him for about $5 down in the mangroves thinking we'd smoke it later when the teachers were asleep but he insisted on rolling it up, pure, into a single huge spliff and we hopped in his little boat and he took us on a tour of the mangrove swamp.

""you like?"" he said.
""yeh its not bad, at home we smoke hash though, do you get it in kenya too?"" i replied. remember this part, as everything that happened later is contingent on this verbal exchange.

during the boat ride i wasn't feeling much, but then it suddenly hit me as we went back to shore: pure brain melt, watery bloodshot eyes, insane paranoia. then the bell rang summoning us back to the camp. i was not ready. we tried to join up with the rest of the group as inconspicuous as possible, but likely looking as conspicuous as hell. over the course of lunch mr f kept on giving us weird looks, feeding my paranoia even more. eventually his gf came up to us and said something like ""boys, your eyes look a bit funny, what have you been up to?"" cold sweats.
""its just hay-fever miss, the villagers took us in the long grass and the pollen got me really bad"".
""it doesn't look like that too me, i better not see you like this again or you'll be sent home"".

about half an hour later, two unexpectedly looking nice cars came down the dirt track leading to our camp. i didn't give them much heed but they pulled up to the gate and about 5 or 6 of the scariest looking dudes got out. 

""my name, can you come to the gate, some people want to speak to you"" someone said, i don't remember who. 

as i was still high i started to panic again and the paranoia was back. i walked over to them. i'm not sure how the conversation went, but the scope of this most colossal fuck up dawned on me. sayid had totally misunderstood me with his broken english. he had thought that i was asking to send hash back home and this was his lucky day and he could act as broker for a deal that would set him up for life, likely calling someone who called someone else and so on until the news had reached some senior guy from mombasa who had come down to the camp to strike a deal. and listen reddit, before you jump on me and call me an idiot and tell me not to travel, lets think about this first. in no way is this a reasonable outcome for the conversation i just had. yeh fine, smoking on a school trip is never a good idea, but i was in the army cadets for 4 years and every trip turned into a smoke up after dark without incident.

i think i managed to mumble some sort of feeble excuse like ""i'm sorry i have to go"". then i ran and hid in the toilets and locked the door.

about a minute later i heard mr f yell my name.

""where the fuck are you, you filthy little druggie""
""where is he boys?""
""hes in the toilet sir""
silence, then mr f's huge tree trunk arms pounding on the door.
""you fucking little shit, what have you done? who are these people? come out here now""

""i can't sir.... i'm on the toilet, its really bad"" this was sadly the best thing i could think of.
""get the fuck out here now""
""i can't sir, its diarrhoea, really bad""
""you fucking little liar, open this door""

he was trying to shake it off its hinges. i wanted to die, i wanted the ground to open up and swallow me, i was going to get expelled, my parents were going to kill me, my life was effectively over.

at this point mr f's girlfriend and mr b stepped in, urging him to calm down.

""let us talk to him"". 
""what happened, why are these people here""
""i'm so sorry, i was just talking about weed and he must of got the wrong idea, i have no idea how this could of happened.""

somehow it was smoothed over, i don't know how, but i stayed in that toilet for hours, fearing shame, mockery and punishment when eventually that door was opened. when i came out the dealers from mombassa were gone. the teachers had searched all my stuff and found nothing which had further supported my defence. 

the rest of the trip passed without incident. i wasn't expelled, my parents weren't called, mr f was even nice to me after a few days, probably embarrassed about totally flipping out. sure there were a few jokes but it was just too surreal to continually feel bad about. also i think mr b and miss f had done me a huge favour by calming mr f, coming to my defence and for that i am forever grateful.

tl;dr a simple misunderstanding during a conversation with an enterprising kenyan fisherman resulted in gangsters driving down from mombassa to arrange terms with me for a hash smuggling operation back to the uk, temporarily making a teacher go berserk at me.

edit 1: thank you again for all the feedback. it's been great having this interaction as it's been a lonely time on my road trip these last few weeks.

i'll try and post my indian mishap on sunday and round off the trilogy. 

on a final note before i go to bed: travel has really helped me with some serious issues in my life such as depression, anxiety and low self esteem. i'd like to create an elitism free space to help and encourage others to give it a go and share experiences, both positive and calamitous. if anyone knows of a suitable medium please message me (i'm not particularly tech savvy fyi).  

edit 2: i should of elaborated on this more but the library was closing and i was trying to hammer out the events as fast as possible on a proper keyboard. they were driving clean bmws (or similar) in an area where most people didn't even have a car, same goes for their clothing.

there was also obviously a head guy amongst them and he has a fair bit of jewelry on. whatever he said to 16 year old me cemented the idea that he was a big deal in my head but i just can't recall what. ",4
"for feeling jealous that my sister is getting more attention for her illness than i am for mine?. about 5-6 months ago, i (18f) started having problems with my ears turning red and getting a lil warm. i scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist bc initially i thought it was allergies. turns out it had to do with the cartilage in my ears rather than the skin. i was referred to a rheumatologist, for whom i had to go make another appointment for, but i couldn't get in to see her for 3 weeks.

while i waited, my ears got worse. to the point where i can no longer leave my room anymore. i have to sit in my room all day, in the dark, in front of a fan, with ice packs strapped to my head because it's that bad. the burning is excruciating and constant. i can numb it with ice packs, but only until they melt.

also during this time, my sister (23f) began to experience lots of issues with cramps and pain in her abdomen. it turns out she has an ovarian cyst which is causing her pain whenever she has her period. i by no means discount that fact that she is in a lot of pain. she is very very vocal about how much it hurts. here's where i'm frustrated, however.

once i finally get to the rheumatologist, she basically sits down and tells me that i have relapsing polychondritis. which is a rare genetic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cartilage in the body. since it's so rare, they don't know what triggers it, and treatment is mostly trial and error. they worry about long term because cartilage is everywhere in your body, including the heart and windpipe. if my body started to attack either of those, it could spell disaster. basically, it could flare up in the wrong place at the wrong time and i could die at a young age because of it. the possibility of a flare up in my heart is a major concern, and i just learned all of this on wednesday.

meanwhile my sister is having issues with her cyst again, and is wailing and crying. for sure she is hurting, but also i just learned that i could die at any point. my parents have elected to skirt around that fact, and haven't offered me a bit of comfort about it, instead focusing on my sister. i am forced (through pure necessity) to sit alone in my room all day long, every day, and have been for the last few weeks. i am extremely lonely. my parents make minimal effort to check on me. at most it's a brief four sentence conversation and then they go right back upstairs to take care of my sister. nobody comes to talk to me, nobody comes to see me, nobody sits with me.

tonight i made it it upstairs to get some food, and i saw my mom in my sister's room, lying on the bed with her, rubbing her back and comforting her. and seeing how much my mom was caring for my sister while also forgetting me made me feel jealous. i don't doubt for a second that my sister is in a lot of pain. i'm just jealous that i've been forgotten about while i've learned that i could die young & that i have an autoimmune disorder that i'll carry with me for the rest of my life. for feeling jealous?",3
"for reporting a lyft driver because he tried to ask me out?. yesterday i treated myself to the movies & wine and decided taking a lyft would be the safest way home. 

the driver was chatty. i asked him about the house music he was playing because i liked it too, in hopes he would crank it up. instead, he began asking me what movie i saw, kept bringing up my 'boyfriend', asking me if i liked girls and so on.

i found this topic of discussion inappropriate & honestly i didn't even want to talk in the first place, but since i was in a locked car with a stranger, i responded casually that i'm not interested in anything & that i enjoy time by myself. 

that did not deter him from asking me out right as i was going to exit the car. i reminded him that i prefer to be alone and left.

part of me says reporting him would make the ride more comfortable for other girls & also appropriate for my level of discomfort but another says that this man made an error of judgment and i should just give him a lower rating instead.

edit:  thanks for all your thoughtful responses. i sent the report in and quickly received a message from lyft expressing concern and interest in resolving the issue. do i want him fired? no, hence this post. i just want him to be reminded on how to prioritize the experience the customer is paying for.

edit 2: this is my final say on the matter. this was not a flattering event for me. my ride was uncomfortable due to the driver's lack of awareness & decorum. i too, work at a job where ratings matter. i do my very best to make sure that my customers feel safe and comfortable. i was a captive audience the whole car ride, and that was taken advantage of. 

i did not expect this post to blow up, but since it did, please read these responses with empathy and learn something today. thank you.",3
"i've never hit my children, but today i slapped my daughter.. i'm a mom, i have a husband and 4 kids. i recently lost my mother. she was evening to me. she was the only parent i had and i lost her. it destroyed me inside thinking the only things left of her is my memories.

we were at the funeral today. one of my daughters (the eldest) didn't even seem to care or want to be there. i stood up on the stand talking about my mom and all i could see is my daughter's eyes pinned to her phone texting. it made me feel sick with rage, but still i carried on talking because that was the only thing i could do now for my mom. i didn't want to make a scene.

when i went back to sitting down i told her to put her phone away and she just replied ""whatever"". i couldn't believe any of this was happening at one of my own parents funeral. it made me feel sick and i didn't know how to respond.

we all followed the casket to the grave. it was the hardest thing i've ever done. burying my father was a lot easier because we weren't as close and i was a lot younger, but my mother was everything to me and stood by me through all my life. she was the only person who i felt i could go to for advice, when i'm upset and when i need a shoulder to cry on. i could remember being with her sitting in the garden when i was a kid. it felt like everything we had was gone and never coming back. when i was a child i thought my parents would live forever and now i was burying my mom. it was the most soul destroying thing i've ever done. it felt like after her death i was just delaying my mourning and it hit me completely at the funeral.

i was crying, but yet again noticed my daughter on her phone, this time taking a picture of herself for snapchat. i lost it there in front of everybody and grabbed her phone and stamped on it. she called me a bitch for stamping on her phone and i lost it and slapped her across the face as hard as i could.

everyone just looked at me like i was some kind of monster. my husband pulled my daughter away and i just stood there watching everyone judge me. like i was some kind of mad woman.

we get home and the car ride was quiet. nobody talked but my husband. all i could think is how i've raised a child who cares more about snapchat than her own dead grandmother. it makes me feel so sick i can't even put into words.

i made meals for everyone but her tonight. she can starve for all i care. i heard my husband talking to her and she said that i was out of order hitting her and she'll never forgive me. it's like she has no idea just how much she has hurt me. it's unforgivable.

i've never slapped my children before. i've showered them in love and attention up until this point. i feel so empty inside and bitter. i'm starting to really resent my daughter. i realize i shouldn't have slapped her, but how could she do this to my mother? her own grandmother? how could she do this to me? i raised her for 14 years and gave her everything she ever needed just for her to become what she has become.",12
"i made fun of a student teacher in 7th grade and i feel terrible for it. it was seventh grade english class, and we had a college student teacher in the class with us. she had just finished telling how she was having a terrible morning (she had slipped on stairs and fell all the way down). she started handing out tests for us and dropped one and bent over to pick it up. there was no noise or surprised reaction so i assumed what had happened, happened when she fell down the stairs. she had ripped her pants right down the middle of her butt. when she bent over to grab the test, you could see just about everything. she had little flowers on her underwear, and you could see  (i'm sorry for the nsfwness) one side of her vagina. i, being a 7th grade male student, hit the arms of every guy around me, motioning to look. she didn't even notice it was out. we all just laughed and thought it was funny and hot (i know i'm terrible). i think about it every now and then and it makes me feel bad. i wish i had told her at the end of class in secret or something. i hope she's doing well and is a teacher by now. i will always feel bad about not saying anything.",12
"updatemy teeth hurt so bad that i feel like death is the only way i will get relief.. remorse: original can be found here. http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2qvy9a/my_teeth_hurt_so_bad_that_i_feel_like_death_is/

hello everyone, i know a lot of people requested pics of once i got my teeth done and i have photos here(http://i.imgur.com/ndjvmkt.jpg) and here(http://i.imgur.com/bfkncbw.jpg).

so before the turn of the year i made a confession about my oral pain caused by my teeth. i didn't think i would receive much attention if any at all. well, i was surprised after so many people shared their stories and offered to help. i got a lot in donations and had a couple of offers to do the procedure for free. the story blew up after the offers (most notably /u/sushiandwow and /u/danhook) and picked up by many websites. i am nothing but grateful to each and every person that made this all possible.

after checking to make sure /u/danhook is who he said he was i took him up on his offer to go see him and let him help me. on feb 1st (super bowl sunday) i went down to florida to get a hotel room before i met him on monday. he is cool as sh*+. totally chill guy that knows what he's talking about and very professional. anyways, we discussed about what he was going to do and about the timeline for everything since i was only down there until friday.
wednesday he took out all my top teeth and i got a denture for it. he told me that he wants to save the bottom teeth and after discussing it with another doctor there they decided it was best. which i am excited about because a bottom denture would suck.

so as of right now i have a denture on top and nothing was done on my bottom. sometime in mid-may to early june i will be going back down to get my permanent top denture, maybe some implants, and get all my bottom teeth fixed. i learned a lot while down there about how to take care and restore my gums and what i need to do so all of this isn't for nothing.

i had an amazing time from the time i left until the time i was home. i did so many new things and it was all thanks to the reddit community. without you guys, gals and others i would still be in pain.

if anyone has any questions i will try to answer them and i'm sure the dentist /u/danhook will chime in a time or two.

edit 2/22/2015: got my kids for the first time since the operation and they love the new teeth. everybody at work seems to like them as well. i still get people that are jealous, but that's natural. i've been preaching to my kids about the importance of oral care and to not end up like me. their mom and i don't have good genes when it comes to teeth, so they need to brush, floss and use mouthwash when after breakfast and before going to sleep.

"my arts school claims that everything created while using their wifi belongs to them. is this legal?. i go to a school in pennsylvania that has a heavy focus on the arts. they provide internet to us students, and they also provide laptops. 
apparently everything created using the school's wifi belongs to the school. to me this seems awfully exploitative considering they make every effort to keep students from using anything else. especially in an arts school where they teach primarily minors, many of whom are unaware of this rule.
so i've got a  few questions; is this legal? how does the legality change if i'm using a personal device, vpn, mobile network, or combination of these? many students' art has been sold and published by the students. is *this* legal, or does it nullify the school ownership?

edit: i went to the administration office and requested a copy of the ""acceptable use policy"" cited by the student handbook. here's the link:

aup https://imgur.com/a/nwoy6g0

acceptable use policy 

to avoid doxxing myself i've censored my name and the name of the school. some interesting points: 
1) the document was signed in 2016. i was, at this time, under fourteen years old. this document may also be outdated, but i have not signed any similar document since.

1.1) even though i was so young, my mother signed an identical document at this time.

~~2) there's a clause that states ""i understand that the technology resources provided to me may be protected under copyright law..."" is this the relevant phrase?~~
as u/sylvan graciously pointed out, this clause is in reference to licensed programs or materials provided by the school:
""they're saying if the school provides software (eg. volume lisenced ms office or adobe creative suite), or course materials like online textbooks or references, you agree not to copy it elsewhere.""



edit: a point i forgot to add. the school may have updated their policy since 2016. they decided (rather inconveniently) this year to go paperless. they didn't explain the policy to us this year, they just told us something like ""you know the rules by now.""

yet another edit: to clarify, i still don't have all of the pertinent documents. i remember a far more in-depth document discussing school technology policy, and i'm searching for this document now. i am going to ask around and tomorrow i will ask the teachers where they got their information.",2
"my pregnant wife blames her infidelity on ""pregnancy hormones""... what am i supposed to do with a baby on the way.... title summarises it pretty much. for the last 3 months my life has been a living hell, my wife uses her pregnancy to defend making my life a living hell. alongside the constant stream of demands during the day, almost every night for the last 3 months she wakes me up in the middle of the night to demand i make/buy her something she's craving. if i'm lucky it's something we have at home, often i find myself making 3am drives to 24hr gas stations or mcdonalds despite starting work at 7:30 am. this even included making me fly from wellington to auckland to get her a stupid bloody giant ""big mac"" cookie because the store doesn't ship them to wellington. she literally badgered me for a week before i finally relented and bought a plane ticket to get her the damn thing.

anyway  sorry for the rambling, to the point of my problem. i found out she has been sexting guys she met on tinder. this all started after she got pregnant, and she is blaming pregnancy hormones for making her feel insecure/horny/etc etc. i know this excuse is probably bullshit, but fuck i'm a guy i have no idea about this sort of stuff.

if she wasn't pregnant i'd leave without saying another word to her. but she is. we have a kid on the way. i feel a moral obligation to make this work. the relationship was honestly much better before she got pregnant, so maybe she's telling the truth? fuck me i'm rambling again.

how the hell am i supposed to fix this relationship when my wife is an emotional train wreck and uses ""pregnancy hormones"" whenever i try to make her see this?",7

"as a californian-born, i can say most californians are douchebags. californians are known for a metro-city living and warm weather lifestyle. they hate cold weather like rain and snow, and they aren't nature lovers. they hate states that isn't california like arizona, colorado, oregon, kansas, florida, new orleans and they never feel like considering living in any of those states. california is too expensive and overhyped. if you wanna move back to california then why are you considering living there? there's ton of things to do in the states that isn't california and you can still still music, writing, film, and stuff. what's the point?

"flying the hammer and sickle is just as bad as flying a swastika. both flags represent campaigns that ethnically cleansed people in the tens of millions. yet only one is considered as representing that. the fact that someone flying a hammer and sickle while burning an american flag can be referred to as ""a brave warrior taking on the rising threat of nazi's"" while literally promoting an ideology that killed if not the same then more people is beyond troubling. its acceptance of genocide when it suits your political affiliation, why is this ok? here is just one example but there are countless more

"men of reddit, what nsfw male lifestyle hack can you share?. ",1
"when my husband walked in on me naked with 7 emergency service men. i'm 6 months pregnant, barely showing and randomly woke up one day last week unable to move. at first, i'm terrified that i'm paralysed. then i realise it's really severe sciatic pain and i genuinely cannot walk/get up or really breathe too deeply.

i have no signal in my room but i do have wifi, so i call my husband who calls emergency services for me. within 20 minutes, 2 firefighters turn up knocking on the door. my husband is a good hour or more away still and they have to break into a window in the bedroom (big french windows). they try to move me, realise they can't and call another two firefighters from the truck outside. even with four of them trying to gently move me up and off the bed, it's not possible. i am in just too much pain and screaming every time they try. they also have no medication. 

my cleaner turns up. idiot me forgot she was due and i could've saved the window, oh well. fu number one. 

in my area, there is a shortage of ambulances so firefighters get called first. they decide we need to wait for the doctor. the doctor takes around an hour to arrive and brings 2 colleagues. they can't numb me, because i'm pregnant and it is only achievable to move me by extremely slowly moving me bit by bit.

of course, at this moment my husband arrives, with an extremely puzzled expression, walking through the smashed french doors. i am at first confused, why does he look so befuddled by this situation, starring his ailing wife? 

oh, yes, probably because i am absolutely buck naked as i cannot move to get dressed, legs akimbo as they are being slowly moved one by one into a better position, surrounded by 7 not unattractive tall german men, 2 of whom are *actively holding my legs open to help me*. it slowly dawns on me i am basically in a porno. and this suddenly becomes really fucking funny to me, so i laugh. and as i laugh, the pain goes all the way from my left big toe to my right middle finger like an electric shock and i pass out. fu number 2. my final image of this scene was my poor cleaner giving me a sympathetic look from the inner doorway and trying not to cross herself looking at my naked state of being. deeply catholic woman. i would rather my entire family see me like this than her. 

turns out later, when i come to, i've really caused my back quite some problems by passing out in this delicate position and i'll be bed-ridden for a few weeks. without decent pain medication because of my developing crotch goblin. i bet the emergency service workers are going to get some mileage out of this one.

tl;dr thought i was paralysed, emergency services had to move me naked, husband walks in and observed 7 men tending to his naked wife, i laugh and do more damage than was there in the first place. 

edit: some people asking why i didn't get covered with a blanket. i'd guess in the half sitting half lying position i was in, a blanket would have slipped off and been really inconvenient for the doctor having to delicately move me. i didn't even notice my nakedness until husband showed up, the pain was way worse than the embarrassment.

"something my ex-band member said to me last night has me rattled.. they use reddit, and to be honest, if they're reading, good.

they were my friend in addition to band member. i was ""fired"", in very vague terms, and replaced by a 60 year alcoholic (i am 24). i started my own band and reworked a song that i had presented to them into my new band.

i log on facebook yesterday with an essay of a message, about how i need to remove it from our demo, how i'll be sued if i use it as ""they did the work, i just played a few chords"". 

at the end of this message was the line that really got me --

""don't pretend this is an original my name composition. we all know you aren't good enough to write a song that good.""

i took the song down, why? because i spoke to my father, who i trust and he told me in no less words, ""be the bigger man and let them get what they want this time, their time will come soon"". i didn't want an unnecessary issue -- i have enough.

but you know i said ....

you say i'm not good enough to write a song and that's your biggest flaw. i wish you success, and i wish success on myself.

today i wrote a new song. and every fucking day now i will write a song, until one day i write the greatest song you've ever heard. i won't crush you with my fists, or in some petty claims court, no fuck that.

i will crush you where it hurts. where you think you are best.

"i think my (28m) gf (28f) might be cheating on me. how to approach the subject without accusing her?. throaway because she introduced me to reddit and reads this sub.

my gf (28f) and i (28m) have been togheter for two years. she's everything i have ever dreamed and we will move together next year. we have talked about marriage and starting a family together. i don't see a future without her tbh. 

she has always been loyal, she is against cheating due to her father cheating on her mom several years ago, and i have never had any doubts until now. it's a very touchy subject for her and she has begged me from the start to leave her if i ever want to cheat. to accuse her of cheating would hurt her for sure. 

however since a couple of months ago she has started using an old phone of hers, i have never seen her using it before and she doesn't use it in front if me but she is not secretive about it... she just leaves it charging in her room in the open, but it's always charging when i am at her place so i know she is using it. 

i thought it had something to do with her studies because she is very tech savy but today her rommate let me in and when i got into her room she closed it as soon as she saw me and she seemed guily as fuck.
but again, she did not hid it, she put it on her nightstand and we went out. 

now i'm home and she is asleep next to me and i can't stop thinking about that damn cellphone. 

i don't know how to approach the subject with her: i cannot snoop because she uses an anti-theft app on all her devices so i will be busted immediately, and honestly i don't want to breach her trust.
i am afraid she will get mad and hurt if i accuse her of cheating, especially if it's not true but i can't think of any explanation for this fucking cellphone. 

ant tips on how to approach the subject?



edit: i woke her up because i couldn't sleep and since the general consensus was to ask i did. 
she was pissed because i woke her up and when i told her why she started laughing. 
she took the phone, put the password ( it was the same as her main phone) and showed me.... it was a mobile game. 
she was embarassed because it's a ""stupid game"" and she feels too old to play mobile games. she is using an old phone because it's addictive and this way she only plays at home with the wifi. 
she gave me the phone and it's the only app installed, whatsapp was disabled, facebook as well. 
she apologized for making me worry but she said to just ask next time. and she went back to sleep. 

god i feel so stupid, but i love this woman.

"wife started to hate me and our kids out of a sudden and now she left us. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c9dwlr/update_wife_started_to_hate_me_and_our_kids_out/)

&#x200b;

hi, this is my first time posting and im not an english native speaker. im also sorry for my mess of a text but im just at the end mentally.

&#x200b;

my \38m\ wife \36f\ started to become increasingly hostile towards me, the kids and her own parents.

our kids are 12, 9 and 4 yo. i first started to notice it around one week ago when our 12 yo tripped while playing and fell on her face. i ran to her to reassure she was ok but my wife didn't really...bother? she just sat on the bench and watched me and our daughter. that evening i asked her why she showed no reaction and she shrugged it off and told me that 'i looked after her so its ok'. thats not her normal behaviour at all and if that had happened a couple months ago she would have dropped everything and immediately look after our daughter.

a day after that incident we ate dinner and the 9 yo asked her to pass him the ketchup. she didn't pass it but responded with 'why do you want to eat our ketchup?'. that caught me off guard and i was extremely baffled. he asked if it isn't also 'his' ketchup but she insisted that its hers and her families ketchup. i thought she was making a joke but she looked extremely stern and sincere, so i gave him the ketchup. the rest of the day was uneventful but she kept looking at me and the kids in this... i really dont know... aggressive fassion. as if we were a threat to her.

during the last week i received only one kisse, not a single hug or any other kind of affection and even if she sometimes smiles at me, it just looks extremely forced. sometimes she just looks at me as if she searches something. obiously i asked her a couple times if something was wrong but she always denied it and said everything is fine. the problem is, if she was only hostile towards me i could somewhat in some way understand it. maybe i annoy her, maybe she doesn't love me anymore or she thinks im cheating or i dont fucking know. but she also seems to hate or at least be neutral towards the children. when they talk about school she doesnt care, when they have problems she doesnt care. she doesn't tuck them in at night and i tell our kids that she's just in a bad mood and has a lot on her plate. but obiously they know as sure as i do that something isn't right. it really got out of hand when 2 days ago her mother called me, asking me if something is wrong with her daughter. apparently she doesnt or at least only briefly answers her texts and doesn't want to meet her anymore. she told me that my wife told her that she 'isn't her real mother' which of course is something horrible to say and we both dont know why she said it or what exactly it meant. when she asked my wife why she just said that she excused herself and said that it was a joke. she never or at least rarely had an argument with her mom. we all hat a great relation up to this week and i just cant in any possible way find out what changed. it kept me up at night because my wife just feels like a different person. now i thought about a mental illness, maybe some form of early altsheimers? but it doesn't seem to fit her behaviour. she had a depression when she was younger but thats 10 years ago. she was as lovely as one can be not even 2 weeks ago. there are a lot of other instances of her behaviour but i dont have the energy to write it down right now.

that brings me to yesterday. i sat her down and asked her if something is wrong and i need an answer now or otherwise we will see a psychiatrist. she started telling me that everything was fine and she just 'has to act as she always does'. that sentence made me feel sick to my stomach because i didn't know what it meant. is she seeing someone? is someone fucking holding her hostage or what is happening? i asked her what she meant but she just brushed it off again, saying that she is ok. i then told her that we're seeing a psychologist and she started screaming at me that i can't make her. i insisted so she threw a cup at me, got up and told me that she wants her 'real family' back. i don't fucking know what that means. we didn't change anything. everything is as it was a month ago. she grabbed her purse and ran out of the house. she returned a couple hours later and told me she is sorry for how she acted. she did a complete 360 and said everything is good now she kissed me and told me she will explain it tomorrow but she is just tired now. when we got to bed later she kept looking at me as if i'm a stranger but i was also extremely exhausted from everything and just fell asleep. its morning now and she left the house. i can't find her and it looks like she packed some stuff of hers. some jackets, her purse 2 pairs of shoes. i called her parents, her friends, everyone she knows but they all havent seen her. her friends told me all that they haven't had contact with her in the last week.  should i call the police now? have some of you experienced something similar? i just dont know what to do. i have never felt this helpless.

&#x200b;

edit: i called the police a couple minutes after the first people here told me to. the police responded and they took my story very seriously and said they will search for her immediately. i told them a couple places she might be. i waited at home and distracted the children, saying that their mom took some time for herself. her parents are at my house and play with the children, they are just as destroyed and unnerved as me.

they have found my wife an hour ago at the local park, 5 hours after they started searching for her. it didn't look like she was fleeing or in a hurry but just waiting, sitting on a bench. they told me however that she was extremely hostile towards the police and punched an officer. she is now in a psychiatric clinic but im not allowed to meet her nor anyone else. doctors are caring for her and will call me as soon as they know more.

thanks for everyone that replied. im extremely worried and im reading into all the mental illnesses you have posted. i just hope it is something they can cure quickly. i still feel like in a bad dream.",7

"for telling my mom i think it's disgusting she is having another kid. i feel like i was in the right but my aunt, three of my siblings think i'm an asshole. i'm 31 and a female and i'm the oldest of ten kids my parents had me at 15,16 respectively. they both dropped out of high school and they got married when my mom was 17. my dad joined the military and they had my next sibling on my moms 18th birthday. my brother is 28, the other kids range in age from 10-27. i grew up taking care of my siblings, my mom and dad expected me to basically help raise their younger kids. because of this i have no interest in having kids myself. my 23 year old sister pretty much took over my role and still lives at home. 

my mom is 46 she homeschools the 10,12,14, and 17 year olds. she has never worked although she doesn't do chores or clean the kids chores cover that. her and my dad bought a fixer upper he planned on fixing up when he retires in a few years, they plan on turning into an organic farm.

however now that's all up in the air as my mom just announced this weekend she is pregnant again. she thought she was suffering from pre menopause..nope she's pregnant. thing is she also admitted she had not been taking her bc for the last year and had hoped to have one more child. 

i lost my cool because my dad has a bad back and he should have retired this year. now with the new baby he is saying he may have to work another ten years. i told my mom she's disgusting for doing that, and she had ten kids that's plenty enough 


she burst into tears and ran out of the room, my dad told me to leave unless i was going to apologize and my 20 year old brother and 23,25 year old sisters told me i was an asshole. 

my 28 year old brother and my gf said i maybe could have said it nicer but they think it's messed up. 

so reddit was i the asshole?",3

"i tricked three rotten kids into eating ex-lax laced cookies. i worked as a lifeguard at a ritzy country club. a lot of tween-agers spent their summer at the pool.  there were three particularly horrible kids, all about 12 years old.  they would do all kinds of things to get under my skin. one of their favorite tricks was the steal the cookies out of my lunch, which meant they sneaked into the guard office to do it. they were caught red-handed more than once. 

the final straw was when they smeared dog shit (i hope it was dog shit) on the lifeguard chair. 

i baked a batch of chocolate chip cookies, but i mixed in ex-lax chocolate flavored chewables. i used the whole box (24 pieces) and it worked out to about one piece per cookie. next day i put 6 cookies in my lunch, and purposefully stayed away from the guard room as much as i could. it worked like a charm – the cookies were gone when i went to get my lunch. i kept my eyes on the three kids all afternoon but they acted normal.

the next day the three kids weren't at the pool. nor the day after.  i learned from one of their friends that the three had come down with a ""stomach virus.""  at the end of the week they were back and i asked one where he had been. he said he had a stomach ache that gave him two days of diarrhea.

they were such little pricks that i honestly have no regrets.

"made a spreadsheet to calculate weekly fun budget for 2017. ended up spending less on fun because became obsessed with increasing fun budget.. prior to 2017, i tended to spend about 40 to 50 usd per week on ""just for me"" things.  then, in late dec 2016 or early jan 2017, i decided to let google docs decide my weekly fun budget.

it's a very simple spreadsheet.  just:

expected 2017 income (fairly accurate)

(minus) overall 2017 expenses (padded)

(minus) this much to reach targeted savings amount (accurate to a dollar)

(minus) in case of emergencies (padded)

(divide) remaining amount by number of weeks left in 2017

i felt quite savvy when google docs estimated about 44$ per week.  anyway, it's now about 50$ per week because apparently, whichever sector of my brain is in charge of ""fun"" has decided that seeing this number go up is more fun than actually spending it.

"update my wife (30f) says i (30m) am unreasonable to ask for adjustments to the ""core of who she is"" for the sake of our marriage.. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbydc3/my_wife_30f_says_i_33m_am_unreasonable_to_ask_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

i'll try to keep this as short as i can!

so, over the weekend we talked much more calmly about some of the stuff that i approached her about. i started off by apologizing for the way i phrased my wants, but also said that just because i was an asshole in the way i handled it doesn't change that those wants still exist. she acknowledged that it is definitely fair to want the relationship to passionate and exciting after being together for  five years.

we came to some of the following agreements:

1. exercise/physical challenging activities together - she confessed that she can't get back into going to the gym because she associates the gym/working out with ten years of her life where she was forced to work out, constantly told she wasn't good enough/needed to be better, and being yelled at by coaches in high school and college. turns out this aversion is something a lot of athletes deal with, which is news to me. i started looking into physical activities we can do together and we're planning to try some different things. we have an indoor rock climbing date planned for this week, which we are both excited about.

2. effort into date night - i backtracked big time on the ""make up and be more fun and exciting"" thing and said that i was a total jerk for saying that and it's not what i meant. i used a horrible example there. i explained in a little more detail that i basically wanted to feel more like she wanted me to be attracted to her. she agreed that it was unfair for her to pull up after work on date nights and just have me run out to the car so we can get to the restaurant and chow down. we will both be putting more effort into date nights. i will do a better job of picking new and fun places to try. she will be more open to trying new things and spend some time after work getting ready. which brings us to the last point...

3. her work hours - she didn't realize the toll it was taking on our relationship that she was exhausting herself at work. she said that she will make a bigger effort to leave by 4:30 going forward and to go in less on the weekends. which will leave more time for us do  things together, even if it's as simple as relaxing by the pool.

i didn't mention the sex stuff. i'm hoping that if these changes stick, that will naturally result in a more passionate sex life.

i ended by asking if there was anything she wanted from me and that she didn't have to respond now. she said she will take some time to think about that, as she hasn't even thought about anything like that lately.

thanks everyone for the advice and i'm excited to see where our relationship goes from here!

more happy update:

she's currently planning a date for us for the weekend, which is a trip to tequilafest in our local downtown. this is something so literally beyond anything she's ever shown an interest in that i'm totally floored lol. sorry i'm not trying to brag just really excited. and i understand that she's probably not interested in tequila, but that she's doing it to make an effort to do stuff together.",7
"austin, honey, go f—k yourself.. hi, austin. you are legally separated from your wife. she is dating. in fact, she is dating the man she was fucking while you were deployed to a war zone. isn't that usually how it works out? she's dating the man who momentarily broke up with her, which caused her so much distress, she tried to commit suicide in front of your kids and forced you to come home from a mission early. 

maybe i shouldn't have gotten involved with you before the ink settled on your divorce papers. but hey: you two are separated. divorces can take a while. especially in the military.  plus, i'd never have sex with someone who was married, technically or not. you and i were flirting. nothing harmful. we were getting to know each other so when you fully and finally divorced, we could figure out if dating was an option or not. 

maybe that says more about me than you. but i'd like to think i have a strong moral compass. i don't cheat or condone cheating, but hey: you signed papers of separation, started the divorce proceedings and lived apart. is it really cheating if you're in the process of getting divorced? it's breaking up + a legal component. but for all intents and purposes, you both acted and were single. you were broken up. a court hearing and a piece of paper were all that were keeping you two legally together. 

here is what i need to say, but i won't say it to you because, well, fuck you. your choice will fuck you up more than my words could. 

the first time, she went psychotic on you, and out of fear of losing your kids, you ghosted me and tried to make it work with her. i get that. you knew that if you didn't play the game, you'd lose the only sources of joy and love in your life. the first time, we were just friends. you cut me out because you were afraid of her construing our friendship as something more. 

but you came back. you came back begging me to give you a real chance. you told me you were done and choosing her over yourself and the potential for anything with me was a big mistake. you called her every name in the book. you took more steps to divorce her this time than last. as a friend, i knew you were serious. so as a potential partner, i allowed the flirting to begin. 

last night, you went back. 

you went back to a woman who won't help you raise your kids. you went back to threats. you went back to someone who has no ambition. you went back to someone who won't even get her ged. you went back to someone who was verbally asking you to come back, while, at the same time, texting another dude to set up a time to fuck later that night. you went back to someone who gets drunk downtown over taking care of her children. you went back to someone who has had you arrested out of spite. you went back to someone who spends your money on bullshit but can't afford her own bills. you went back to someone mentally unstable when she doesn't get her way. you went back to someone who only wants to stay married because she won't get a real job, therefore she is unable to support herself with rent, groceries or a car payment — in other words, a leech. or in military speak: a dependapotamous. a term i learned from you, by the way. 

so, this time, instead of wondering why i wasn't good enough or what i'd done wrong, i woke up early, got a good workout in, got my favorite coffee, got my nails done, ordered chanel makeup (i just love seeing the box come in the mail), bought a new dress from neiman marcus, got dressed to the 9's and went out for cocktails with my best bad ass ladies and celebrated international women's day. 

you missed out on a hard working attorney who would never dream (or need) to depend on you for money. you missed out on someone who wanted to help you grow. you missed out on someone with ambitions and goals and an education. the only baggage i'd have brought was my student loans, which i wouldn't depend on you to pay. you missed out on a whole lotta love, respect, and stability. 

and i dodged a motherfucking bullet. good luck fucking crazy and lazy for the next 14 years till your kids are grown and gone. i have court cases to win and people to help. you, thankfully, won't be one of them. 

thank you, next. ",11

she also told me that she dated her best friend (a girl) for 3 years. that damn girl stayed over at my house a thousand times! they used to lock themselves in my daughter's room and play really fucking loud music all the time. i thought they just jumped around and danced and sang. i'm not so sure anymore. 

we decided not to tell my wife anything yet. she'll tell her a few days before we fly back home.

so yeah, my daughter is gay. and it's great because it means she's not gonna get pregnant.

i took pictures of the chat with my phone since i think this is most likely ending in a divorce. i decided to come home early and i walked into my house silently and it was confirmed they were cheating on my own bed. i left without making noise and i had a big beautiful rose for her, i cut a small part of my wrist and let some blood on the paper with the rose and i wrote a note to her saying 'here is your love'.

i drove off to a liquor store and bought whiskey and swishers and i picked up half an ounce of marijuana from a friend. i drove to a mountain that has a cliff of the whole city and right now i'm here and she keeps on texting and calling me like she is desperate. i am losing my mind here. i am still up here just looking at the lights and i feel like my world just ended. i hate the thought of myself now and i just feel like i don't even belong here anymore

tl;dr my wife is cheating on valentin'es day and i don't want to be here anymore

update 1- i am driving home now and will probably sleep outside in the hammock or something

update: i am home safe now ordered some food and i have another blunt left but i will stay outside in the backyard for now- i am invited my cousin and his wife over, he is basically like a brother to me so i will most likely be okay

update- she heard my cousin and his wife pull up and she came out. okay she started crying and basically throwing a tantrum and begging me to forgive her. well my cousin's wife maria took her inside and sat down with her so they're talking and i'm outside with my cousin taking a smoke break

update: i woke up to her crying to me and begging. i didn't say anything. i feel dead on the inside like if somebody ripped my heart out and smashed it on the floor

edit:i didn't expect even half of these comments thanks a lot for the support sorry if i don't grt to reply to everyone i fell asleep. i am off to work for the day and will rewd your comments after i am back thanks again

edit: i haven't done much yet but i plan on going up the mountain again with my cousin and his wife to look down at the lights. we are going to hang out up there and hit some wax to relax a little. i talked to my wife finalky asking why she cheated and i don't know whether to believe this or not but she said 'it was the thrill of having a new guy showeing with attention"" then again she cried and begging to work it out and i went for a walk without saying a word. apparently she has been talking this guy for a few months and met him at a grocery store. she told me the while truth and that they onky went in dates and that that was the first time the had sex. i am not trying to be cucked so fuck no i am not trying to fix this shit anymore i'm done being a helpess mister fucking nice guy. i know i kind of overreacted at first but thank you guys for helping me stop hurting myself. i am not going to use any hardcore drugs just some mari-j and some whiskey nothing more. sorry if i snapped at you in the comments i am just having mixed emotions of anger and sadness

"my babies and i escaped to a shelter for victims of domestic violence at 3am last night... i'm scared, my kids are confused... i don't even know how i feel right now but nothing seems real.. update
just received a call from the police in our town. it was a weird area code so i almost didn't answer. he said he was with our police department and that my kids dad called them. i told him we were at a domestic violence shelter and he said he read the report and wasn't calling to get info for him but to make sure me and the kids are okay. i told him about the non step messages and phone calls and he said to make sure my advocate sees all the messages and to write it down and that if he keeps harassing me to call him back even before the protective order is officially filed. sounds like they are on my side too. thank god. 
end update

my children's dad and i have been together for about 4 and a half years. the insults, emotional abuse and mental instability were apparent from literally day one but i think i was so broken and damaged back then i was just happy not to go to bed alone.  the physical violence started within a couple of weeks. i still remember crying on my way to work within the first month of us dating asking myself ""why are you in this? why are you allowing this to happen to you?"" after he drug me by the hair the night before through the apartment to the bathroom after i didn't clean it to his standards. 

when i finally told myself i would rather be lonely than treated this way and was prepared to leave i found out i was pregnant and everything changed. i was always told i couldn't have kids so this was my miracle and i wanted to see if i could make this family work. i spent almost the whole pregnancy in the hospital with hg and cardiac problems wracking up medical bills and losing everything including my car since i couldn't work. by the time my son got here though none of it mattered... he was my world and the most beautiful thing i had ever seen. on the way home from the hospital my ex's sister asked me if he had ever been abusive to me and it caught me off guard... i just said no and stared ahead as she told me of his history. another dumb move on my part just hoping i could make it work. 

almost every day there was some type of conflict... any inner turmoil or demons he faced would turn into him trying to take anyone around him down with him. my name basically became ""cunt"" and the bruises faded and new ones came and faded again. 

i became pregnant with our second child and nothing changed still. i still have the photos from when he punched me in the face and busted my upper and lower lips open when i accidentally burnt his pizza. 
our baby girl arrived and once again was the most precious gift to me but things continued to take darker twists with every unstable mood he would come home in.  his favorite thing to do was tell our toddler son to ""get a knife and stab mommy""

last night was the end though. i have been saving to leave and was hoping to be able to be out by summer. the day started with him angry about nothing and coming home from work telling me i'm a worthless piece of shit. he left to go to a bar and came back around 11pm so drunk he could barely put words together but was still able to throw soda cans, objects and food at my head, start yelling the ""n"" word over and over again and call me every name in the book through his drunken slurring. after he threw something else and tagged me in the face i finally called the police and before they got there he took off. i filed a report and locked all the doors. 

he started texting me saying some of the most psychotic things like ""i hear you beating the kids, stop beating the kids, why are you doing this. let me in, stop beating he kids"", so i had to take pictures all over the outside and inside of the house to make sure i have time stamped proof he was out of his mind. 

i called an emergency domestic violence shelter i was referred to and they said they would get us in at 7 am but before i could even get done packing he busted down the deadbolted door so i threatened to call the police again, picked up the kids and ran. we got to the police station where the shelter volunteers got us safely to the shelter. i have never felt so much relief in my life but so much anxiety of what is to come. 

he has been texting me all day going between threatening messages and apologies. saying he would rather the kids end up in foster care than with me and that he will make false cps reports against me. 

the shelter is helping me get a protective order and build cases against him for both victims compensations, cps, and custody and are helping with counseling and legal aid. 

it's so strange to say it's over... there is so much ahead but i'm free. my kids are free.... 

sorry for the rambling... i can barely process what's been happening ",7
"i learned today that my 14yo daughter has been so depressed that she's contemplated suicide multiple times.. i'll call her jane. that's not her real name. jane was born without a thyroid gland. there was a lot of medical appointments when she was an infant and toddler. she has to take a synthetic thyroid pill every day. not so bad. as the pediatric endocrinologist told us days after she was born: ""no parent wants their child to be born with a disease, but if you have to have a child born with a disease, you should pick this one because it only means she has to take a pill every day for the rest of her life. otherwise, she'll have a perfectly normal life.""

so at 14, she needs a blood test to determine her thyroid hormone levels every six months: that happens to be march and september for her. because of the way that health care works in the us, i have to take her to her primary care doctor each time in order for him to tell my insurance company to pay for the upcoming blood test.

today, during jane's checkup (but after a long conversation about her menstrual cycles), the doctor said, i need you to leave the room now. thinking myself a savvy and cool father, i figured this is when the the physician asks my daughter if she's sexually active. as i left the room, i said, ""jane, if the doctor writes you any prescriptions that you are embarrassed by, then i will not ask any questions."" there's no more direct way of indirectly saying, ""i won't judge you for being sexually active if the doc says you need birth control pills."" right?

so after 10 minutes in the room where i waited while the doc chatted with jane, the doc came in, and closed the door. ""i need to speak with you, mr. doe."" now, i'm not the type that deludes himself into thinking that his daughter will wait until marriage... or even perhaps to 18. 14 is a whole different ball game. my heart lept with fear that jane was sexually active.

that's when she showed me the paper that she had been carriying. there was nothing on it about sex. the whole form was about depression. i glanced at the questions about depression in which she usually checked off the category, ""multiple times every day"". my eyes suddenly became fixed on the two questions at the bottom of the page:

1. i have thought about suicide? (the yes box is checked)
2. i have thought about how to commit suicide? (the yes box is checked)
in the notes section for question 2: ""i thought about stabbing myself with a kitchen knife.""

now look, i've got a plan that i've started in conjunction with her doctor that involves psychologists, possibly psychiatrists and anti-depressant drugs, more frequent well-checks with the pcp, and even a vacation to her favorite place ($700 plane ticket) with her favorite cousin over winter break. i knew she was embarrassed, so i told her how i have had the same thoughts, and needed to be on prescriptions for those thoughts since returning from iraq in 2006. the point of this paragraph is that i don't need advice. i am confident in my plans. support is nice, but as the name of the subreddit suggests, i'm just getting this off my chest.

"by accidentally complimenting a patients penis. this happened yesterday and im still horrified and laughing about it. im an ultrasound tech. i had a patient come in for an ultrasound because he has some swelling in one of his testicles. the normal procedure is i leave the room, he takes off his pants and underwear and lays on the exam table and covers up with a sheet. i come back in the room and place a towel over his groin while pulling down the sheet. he remains covered. i place another towel over his legs below the testicles. this keeps only the testicles exposed during the procedure. 


everything good so far. the scan involves checking each testicle as well as the surrounding area. for the most part this is just place and, get image, repeat. as im working, i can see he is slightly uncomfortable and keeps moving. it's not uncommon for men to get an erection. typically i ignore it but this guy is shifting enough that im not able to get images. i say ""don't worry about it. it's normal but i need you to hold still.""


he settles down and i continue. the towel is bulging enough that i can tell he still has the erection. i need images of the urethra so i am checking his shaft also. yep still hard. ok so this guy is hot! i have an attractive man laying on the table with no pants and an erection covered by nothing more than a bulging towel while my hand is rubbing a wand along the length of his erection. no big deal im a professional. i finish and start to put the machine away but between his moving and my nervousness i don't realize that the cord is under the edge of the towel. the towel starts to slide off as i pull so i reach down to stop it. im reaching between the bed and the ultrasound machine and lose my balance. i have a hold of the towel as i start to fall and rip it off. a blob of what i hope is lube from the ultrasound catapults up and hits me in the face as im bent over. not thinking, i use the towel that is already in my hand to wipe myself off. as im wiping my face on this guy's loin cloth i get a good view of him. after a moment i realize that im just staring at his extremely large and very erect penis. he is completely exposed but afraid to cover himself because i already got onto him for moving earlier. i start to apologize. i meant to say something along the lines of ""oh my god im so sorry"". instead what comes out is ""wow impressive"". i mentioned im professional right?


i lay the towel back over him, fumble to put the machine away and tell him to get dressed and open the door when he is done. he tries to tell me it's no big deal when he was leaving but i was so embarrassed that i couldn't even make eye contact.


edit: i'm not sure why this became so popular. there is a lot of mix between 'you made his day' and 'you should be fired'. i admit it was a mistake and i didn't intend to say something. i hope i didn't make him uncomfortable with my comment. i reported it to my supervisor though and was (am) willing to accept the consequences. i admit it was a mistake on my part. yes i'm female. no i wasn't trying to brag that women get away with abuse. yes i'm human and make mistakes. yes i apologized to the man several times for both my comment and for my clumsiness. he wasn't upset when he left the office but if he files a complaint then i will understand and i will live with it. no i did not ask him out. no i will not call him from his file. i have to get ready for work now. i will either reply to more comments or delete this post entirely later. i wasn't trying to create unwanted attention for this man or make light of the situation. i was still horrified by it when i posted so thank you to those that supported me because you helped me relax over the situation but i don't consider that permission to do it again. thank you strangers for the gold/silver/platinum.


edit2: quick update over lunch break because this has taken off so much. i expected 20 people to read it and along. my supervisor pulled me off one of my appointments earlier and called me into his office where other hospital personnel were waiting. i knew what was coming next. after i reported the incident my supervisor filed a report. this kicked off a whole process which included someone reaching out to the patient proactively for damage control. the good news is that the guy isn't upset. he had no clue why they were calling him and they said he started laughing when they explained. he was apparently apologizing to them and thought it was a waste of their time. he said and this is the best part that if he has to come back he hopes i'll be there. :) the bad part is i had to sign some forms for the hospital and was reminded that i need to be more careful. i feel i got lucky because this could have been much worse.

edit 2: thanks to this post, i have finally learned that i am white. i want to thank reddit for this revelation; life has been difficult for me before you guys helped me find myself.

edit 3: it has come up a lot that people think i'm advocating for people to not vote in the election. i want to make it clear now that that is not the case. it's obviously important to exercise your right to elect the officials in this country. that's why i want for people to pay more attention to local government, and to be aware that the presidential election isn't as important as reddit and media as a whole makes us believe. what goes on closer to home is so much more important to you, but the presidential election is obviously important as well. you *should* vote, but please look into everything around you, not just what gets media coverage.",6
"please take some time to understand your benefits at work. i'm a federal employee and you wouldn't believe how often i encounter people who have no idea how any of our benefits work. the most common i see are:

* people find out they (or their federal employee spouse) are pregnant and want to know how much maternity leave we get (answer: none)
* they think fmla is 12 weeks of paid leave - this is disturbingly common
* then they want to know how they can get short-term disability after the baby is born (answer: that's not a benefit the government gives you - you would have had to enroll before now)
* they want to know how the leave bank works (many agencies have this) and are shocked when they find out they would have had to already be contributing to it in order to draw from it
* they have no idea how our retirement savings (tsp) work - have either not been contributing since they started employment, or are contributing a little but have never adjusted the allocation beyond the government bond fund that all new enrollees are in

most people are pretty good at researching all the ins and outs of health insurance, but beyond that they make a lot of assumptions about our benefits and never bother to dig into the details. this leaves you woefully unprepared for an event like a medical emergency or pregnancy.",10

"can i file for a restraining order for an ex-girlfriend that hasn't left me alone for almost five years (since we broke up). hey!
just a bit of backstory, i dumped this girl in ninth grade after she committed credit card theft (just her parents' card, but spent almost $1000). obviously if she'd steal from her parents, she'd steal from her boyfriend. she's never let it go. no other boyfriends, and got into crazy amounts of trouble at school afterwards. in senior year, she was busted for sending nudes of herself to minors, from fellow seniors (myself, 17 at the time, included) all the way down to seventh graders. (she was 19 at the time) school covered it up, even with copious amounts of proof. she was let off without even a suspension. nonetheless, she's never stopped contacting me. every two months or so, she'll try to text me with a new number or social media account or email. i block them constantly, but it's like cutting the head off of a hydra. two more replace it. she's constantly belittled me, made fun of my mother's death, lied to girlfriends i had, saying we slept together and such, and basically done everything she can to ruin anything that makes me happy, and i'm tired of it. she emailed my college email account the other day, as we both go to the same community college, and i wrote up this reply, but before i sent it, i wanted to know if there is anything i should/ shouldn't say.

julia,

listen, i'm going to be completely honest with you. i don't know why you keep trying to contact me. at the risk of coming off rude, julia, i literally want nothing to do with you. i don't want to talk to you. i don't want to see you. i just don't want you to be part of my life. i'm sorry if that hurts your feelings, but we broke up in ninth grade. we're done. permanently. please, for the love of god, find a new hobby. i've given you chances on top of chances and every time i try and reconcile with you, you fuck me over, and i'm really tired of it. your opinion of me is the last thing i care about, so call me whatever you want, but i'm tired of you fucking up anything that makes me happy because you get some sick form of pleasure from it. please don't contact me, my family, or my friends again. if you do, and i'm being 100% honest here, i will file for a restraining order. you're coming dangerously close to stalker territory, and i'm done. so, politely, fuck off.

regards,
u/homelesscheeto

so, i guess my final question, are these acceptable grounds to file a restraining order? or does she physically need to be stalking me or whatever. any advice would be appreciated! (going to school for law so i'm curious to get some expert opinion here) thanks :)

"i think i'm (28f) in an abusive relationship with fiance (31m) of 7 years.. i'm on my phone, sorry. 
he's done a lot of mean things to me. he has hit me before on more than one occasion but only when i let things escalate to that point. i'm usually pretty good at keeping him happy and calm although i do feel like i'm walking in eggshells most of the time. 
we live together and he likes it when i tie his shoes before he goes to work. if i don't do this, or anything that he wants, he makes me feel bad. he will pout or say mean things until i do what he wants. i usually just do what he wants to avoid the drama. this includes sexual stuff as well. i have to make sure not too much time goes by between me getting him off or he complains saying he needs it to feel normal and content. he forces me to let him touch my breasts and if i resist he says my body is his body and i should be grateful he appreciates it. 
my parents are ready to move me out tomorrow. i've been staying with them since wednesday night when he randomly started yelling at me in a restaurant, calling me a cunt and telling me to go fuck myself  then kicking me out of our apartment without my phone or anything but the clothes on my back. it's been so long since something like this happened but i think it's only because i cave to everything he wants and anticipate his needs so well. 
this is abuse, right? even if sometimes your happy and in love? and it doesn't happen all the time? why do i feel like i don't want to leave him even though he makes me miserable and anxious? 
he keeps messaging me asking me to come back and saying that he will change but i don't think he sees his behaviour  as a problem and he just expects things of me because i've been doing it for so long and don't complain. i feel like he's confused as to why i'm leaving because i've put up with it until this point.
sorry for rambling. i am very upset.

"my schizophrenic older brother killed our abusive parents.. this happened about seventeen years ago. today, all of these memories came flooding back for some reason or other. 

my parents physically abused me and my brother. i was very young, about six-years-old when they died, but i remember their anger and violence so clearly. my brother was ten years older than me. he always protected me. 

one day, my mom was punishing me for getting mud on the kitchen floor by holding my head in a sink filled with water. she was trying to drown me, i swear. i urinated on myself out of ear. it happened so quickly. i just remember my brother pulling me back, then he just choked my mother until she passed out. 

my brother hugged me and told me it's okay and then he went and murdered my father. both of them had broken necks. my brother was committed to a psych ward but killed himself. i went to live with my aunt and uncle and had a great life. 

i think everyone assumes that i've forgotten about this, but i haven't. i remember. i remember how hard i cried when my brother died, but i only allowed myself to break in secret, because everyone else labeled him as a monster. 

what he did was horrible, i understand, but he saved my life. i believe that. i know he loved me, and i loved him, and i miss him every single day of my life. 

just wanted to tell someone. hope you all have a good day. ",11

"by poisoning my cat, parsley. this guy(https://i.imgur.com/uu57bdj.jpg)
usually parsley is a **huge dildo cat**, always wanting food and pats, biting if he doesn't get what he wants, sitting on my face, **big dick energy** without the balls.

this morning when i woke up later than usual he was not up in my grill wanting food, weird but okay. he's sleeping curled up on the couch, when i say good morning he looks at me like - __- and gets up. tries to jump of the couch, stumbles, lands **face first.**

i laugh he gets up and he starts walking weird, not limping just uncoordinated. usually he's **pretty vocal** too especially when he's hungry but he was **completely quiet**, his sister smacked him and he barely even **reacted**

now i'm **freaking out**, thinking he has a **blood clot or a brain tumor** or something. i book him in for an urgent appointment at the vet in half an hour.

i keep an eye on him while we wait, at one point he tried to scratch his ear with his back leg and **missed several times.** when he tried to loaf he was sort of **wibbling wobbling.** he didn't seem interested in food until i started feeding his sister, shenanigans, but luckily he ate so i was feeling a bit better.

**at this point i'm crying thinking the motherfucker is gonna die on me like a bitch.**

we take him to the vet, he goes into his carrier calmly without incedent which is very unusual. vet tests his legs, stretching them out and rotating, nothing there. he often gets abscesses from fights but nothing like that. vet checks his gums and teeth, his gums are a bit pale which is an **indication of onion toxicity which is fatal**. we'd had nachos the night before which has a bean mix with onions. i tell them he might have gotten some from the pan since we didn't clean it up straight away. if the onion toxicity is bad enough he might **need a blood transfusion to save his life.**

he's also slightly overweight and middle aged which makes him **at risk for diabetes** which can cause nerve damage when left untreated. 

he's kept at the hospital for the rest of the day for observation and blood tests. vet gives me **brochures on possible household toxins** that are harmful to cats. i go home in tears thinking my cat might be **dying** and blaming myself for not cleaning up the **freaking nachos** last night.

i read some of the brochures to calm down. i go through them thinking maybe he got to some lilies in a neighbours backyard or he licked bleach out of toilet. then there was **the last entry.**

**marijuana. oh fucking shit fuck.**

motherfucker i'd made some **super strong cannabutter** last night in prep for a patrick swayze move night this weekend. that pot had a cup of butter and **a quarter ounce of hydro, simmering for 3 hours**. parsley also **loves butter** and the smell of weed doesn't put him off. 

parsley has always been **terrified of stoves** though, from when he touched it while it was on so he doesn't go near them while they're lit. i'd strained and refrigerated the cannabutter quickly after making it but i'd left the dirty pot in the sink over night. i decide to check it and

**that bitch is suspiciously clean.**

parsley isnt fucking **dying** he's just high as a **god damn kite.**

i have to call the vet and tell them my suspicions. his blood test came back negative for anything scary. he'd had **6 serves of chicken** while at the vet and **napped** almost all day, played with some dogs and snuggled with some kittens. motherfucker had a **great time. **


**tldr i made dank cannabutter, left out the dirty pot in the sink overnight, stupid cat licked it clean and had a real good time on my dime. i should charge him for it. **

edit 1: boy, this bold keyword thing is very contentious huh

edit 2: can now confirm after making caramels that the cannabutter is strong

edit 3: there were some people worried that i would be letting parsley eat his fill in the future. i assure you i will not, i did say it was a fuck up after all

"my (28 f) mom was right. she told me my marriage wouldn't last because my husband (32 m) was always very smooth talking. she thought he was too attractive for me.. two weeks ago he called me (he has never been careful with his phone) and i picked up. 

he was having a conversation with a woman. she sounded very flirty and was saying something like ""you like it better with me than her, don't you baby?"" and he answered that he did.

he must have realized the phone was on because that night when he got home he came right out and told me he's met someone else and wants a divorce to be with her. 

the few people i've told say at least we don't have kids which i am sick of hearing. it's true, but it doesn't make me feel any better.

these skills that everyone needs aren't the school's job.  i loved woodshop in school and wish they would reimplement it, but how to use a saw or a screw driver is something learned in the home.  how to boil and egg, following a recipe should be learned in the home.

"updateutah sheep farmer trying to have therapy dog put down.. i few weeks ago i posted this...

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bqkxrd/utah\_sheep\_farmer\_trying\_to\_have\_therapy\_dog\_put/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bqkxrd/utah_sheep_farmer_trying_to_have_therapy_dog_put/)

&#x200b;

tl;dr - i work at a residential facility for youth in custody.

&#x200b;

we have a dog on site.

&#x200b;

dog is directly supervised by staff 24/7 just like the clients.

&#x200b;

dog is either locked inside with us, or tied outside with us.

&#x200b;

someone came to our facility claiming witnesses state that our dog killed one of their sheep.

&#x200b;

i tell them to kick rocks.

&#x200b;

a few hours later, someone from the city comes threatening to take the dog.

&#x200b;

i tell them they cant prove it was this dog.

&#x200b;

they tell us to work it out with the sheep owner.

&#x200b;

\---

&#x200b;

ok, a few weeks went by and we didnt hear from the sheep owner again. my boss, the actual owner of the dog, was happy to just let it go, but he was worried that this time was passing because they were preparing some sort of legal action, so he did finally get in touch with them.

&#x200b;

a few weeks ago, they told us they had checked out the sheep and it was not going to make it.

&#x200b;

now, they tell us they cannot produce a sheep. ok, its been a few weeks. the remains are probably disposed of by now.

&#x200b;

a few weeks ago they say they had taken pics of the damage.

&#x200b;

now they tell us they cannot produce the pics.

&#x200b;

a few weeks ago they tell us they have an eyewitness, later changed to multiple eyewitnesses.

&#x200b;

now we find out it was one guy who reported it from work. he does not work within view of their field. he works at a city dump right next door to our facility and who has a history or verbally abusing our residents (telling them they should be penned in like animals, theyre rapists, homos, etc).

&#x200b;

anyways, we started pushing the issue and we find out that this guy who works next door to us is in a bad mood one day and just decides he hates our kids more than normal. maybe he decides they dont deserve a dog. i dont know. at any rate, he calls up a nearby sheep owner and tells them he saw our dog kill a sheep.

&#x200b;

they couple who own the sheep are so worked up they dont even go to their field to check it out. they come straight over here and start mouthing off. i tell them our dog never leaves the facility and it cant be our dog. they say theyll be back with police and leave.

&#x200b;

they then go to their field and find out there is no dead sheep. instead of owning up to their error, they double down and call the city. perhaps keeping up the act to save face.

&#x200b;

police told them they dont have sufficient evidence so they called animal control. animal control comes and i tell them they cant prove it was this dog. this dog never leaves the facility. its always either locked inside or staked outside.

&#x200b;

the city leaves and we never hear from the couple again until we get in touch with them and piece all this together.

&#x200b;

our dog is fine and sleeping on a couch right now.

"my (23f) boyfriend (28m) says my vagina is too big. so my boyfriend and i have been dating for about 5 months and he told me yesterday that my vagina is too big ""for my size"". i'm somewhat on the smaller side (5'3"" 135 lb) and he said i must be lying about how many guys i've been with. when we first started seeing each other we spoke about our past and i told him i've been with two guys before, both longterm boyfriends (which is the truth). we haven't talked about that since until yesterday with him saying that my vagina couldn't have been stretched out that much from just two guys and i had to be lying. i asked him why he is bringing this up now if it is such a problem and he said he always thought it was big and just didn't want to bring it up until now. i told him that really hurt my feelings and that was a horrible thing to say and he just said he just wants to hear the truth about who i've been with in the past. i told him he is an asshole and left and haven't spoken to him since yesterday.

i just want to point out as well that neither of the guys i was with in the past ever seemed to have a problem with the size of my vagina and neither of them were that big either (but both were bigger than my current bf). i don't have a problem with my boyfriend's size and enjoy sex when we have it, but he said he has a hard time finishing inside me because ""he can't feel anything"". when we first started going out it didn't seem to be a problem, but recently i have been needing to finish him with my hands or mouth for him to go.

i don't know, this just really hurts. he not only insulted me by saying i have a loose vagina and he doesn't enjoy having sex with me but also basically said i'm a slut and i'm lying to him. there isn't like there is anything i can do about it if i am too big (i looked). he is a great guy otherwise and i really love being with him and it is just really hurting me thinking he is going to end our relationship over this and that he is capable of saying those things to me.

"i(21m) got caught lying about my age by my girlfriend(25f). her anger has mostly subsided. but her friend who outed me has been egging her on to dump me. what should i do?. last year i got dragged into a meetup for asian foreign students by my indian roommate. btw i am a 2nd gen japanese-american. we were late and had already missed the introduction stage. the room had already divided into groups and from the corner of my eye i saw this really tall and beautiful asian girl standing alone holding a big dictionary in her hands. it took me some time to approach her but i finally did. i said hi and she introduced herself in broken english. she was from korea, a few years elder to me and was doing her grad studies in a university near mine. i introduced myself too and only mentioned my university name which is an ivy league university. she was really impressed as my uni is pretty famous back in her home country. i took her number and we started texting.

we mostly texted about her classes (she is a business grad) and i was pretty good in those subjects too. as days went on our conversations got deeper. after a few weeks i asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend and she said yes. i started calling her 'boo' and she started calling me 'oppa'. i thought it meant the same as honey or babe or something in korean.

it was only after a few more months that i came to know that something was wrong. my roommate overheard her calling me oppa on the phone. he asked me that whether my gf was okay with dating someone younger to her. i asked him why would she worry. and then came the bombshell. it turns out that oppa means big brother in korean. it is usually used by girls to address guys who are older. but its also used as a synonym for honey or babe for boyfriends who are elder to their girlfriends. it cant be used for guys who are younger than their girlfriends. also, it turns out that age is a pretty big issue in korea.(my roommate watches a lot of korean dramas.)

so the next day i asked my girlfriend about it and all of it turned out to be true. that day she was introducing me to her other korean classmates too. when they asked me about my age, before i could even answer she told them i was 26. later on i asked her how she knew my age as i had never told her directly. she told me she got it from facebook and was happy that i was older as she would have probably not dated me if i was younger. (i had created my facebook account when i was 10 and put a fake bday ) and at that moment i knew i was in trouble.

i was trying to figure out how to tell her the truth without making her so angry that she would dump me. before i could do that i was outed by one of her friends. my gf stopped taking my calls and ignored me for 3 days before she agreed to meet me. she asked me if i was trying to play with her feelings and was it all a joke. she was very angry and i had to do a lot to convince her that i really love her. i was so scared that she would dump me that i started crying. i guess that melted her heart a little bit. she told me to let her calm down for 2 days. after those two days she accepted me again.

she has decided that she is not gonna let my age matter to her. but her korean friends have already termed me as an american playboy who is going to cheat on her any day.  i am scared that one day she would get brainwashed by them and dump me for good. what should i do?

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: i took her out for dinner yesterday. her friends joined us afterwards. we talked it all out. luckily my gf was on my side. i guess her friends took the story in a sporting manner too. though i did feel some glares from one of them. 

before that my gf and i had a long talk. from what i understood she was just scared that i was just playing a game with her or something like she had seen in many american shows. she comes from a small town in korea where people have many weird stereotypes about americans in general. anyways we sorted it all out. i told her about my fears too. to that she said if we were to ever break up it would be because of something between us and not because of someone from outside.

btw my roommate suggested me to call her 'noona', so i did but she straight up got angry at that stuff.  it seems i have a lot to learn. i can also see that sometimes she gets conflicted in the way she addresses me but i find it cute.

thanks for all the advice. i was in a very bad mental state when i wrote this post. she is like my first girlfriend whom i would really wanna marry. to lose her would really break me apart. i know i am a man and stuff but this is one of the places i can really let it all out.",7

he was supposed to have charges pending in wyoming but the documentation and record of the report mysteriously disappeared and no one knows where everything went, and the victim has since become severely disabled and cannot credibly re-report because she can't talk or write.

i had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. 

the date was going ok. it was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so i decided to break the tension. a while ago, i heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order french fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. i've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. 

when the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. i then asked the waitress, ""does the guac have onions?"" to which she responded, ""yes, it does"".  i then proceeded to tell her, ""i have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?"" i told her i have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. after the waitress left, my date asked me, ""are you really allergic?"" to which i said ""no :d, but this way, we get fresh guac"". she was pretty impressed like ""damn, i'm stealing this one"". when the guac came in, i asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. 

the rest of the date went well. we ordered some drinks first and then food later. what i forgot to do when i was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. when i got my dish, i took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! she thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. i didnt know how to react so i just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so i tell him that i forgot to mention not to put onions and that i have a severe allergy. 

the first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  

(side note: i don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. i have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but i know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, i thought it makes you cough a lot, i don't know why i thought that.) 

cutscene to now: i start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. i tell him, ""i barely got any onions in the bite"". my date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. i told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that i'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. i asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (not like we ate anyway) but i still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. 

after leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. i shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. now it is important to note that the bus stop where i grab my bus to go home is right opposite the restaurant. i'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. he thinks that i am taking the bus to the emergency room.  

he kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. he felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. i finally gave up and told him , ""okay"". in my head, i thought i'd just let him drop me there and then i'll take an uber back home. however, we get there and he wants to come in to make sure everything is ok.  i'm like hey man, trust me, im okay. nothing is going to happen to me. you can leave. it was so awkward. we were parked and he kept asking if i'm sure and i'm like yes i'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. 

at the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. we walk in the emergency room and i'm the only person there. great. i had to walk to the nurse and tell her that i might be having a slight allergic reaction. supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and i'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. ""thank you so much for everything."" he gives me his number and tells me to inform him once i'm out. 

here i am. a healthy 25 year old adult. having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfu3k5g
another nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and i had to sheepishly tell him, ""i think i might have been having an allergic reaction"". he says, ""are you allergic to anything?"" and i go ""no"". 

he gave me a benadryl and sent me out. i then spent another $25 to uber home. i told what happened to my friend and she said i was the worst kind of asshole. i learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy again. 

tl;dr: pretended to have an allergy to get fresh guac to impress my date. got served the food i was fake allergic to, and was forced to visit the er.

"if you're having trouble explaining something computer-related to your parents, instead of explaining it to them over to the phone, record yourself doing it and send them a video. they'll be able to follow along better since they see it happening and will save everyone a lot of frustration

edit: turns out my method of recording the screen is inefficient and ancient as fuck. your recommendations are the shit, here's a compilation of what i saw+tried (will keep adding as they come in):

1. http://www.useloom.com/ -> this thing kicks ass, like how the fuck have i not known about this, you click a button and it records your screen, your camera and your mic so you can narrate what you're doing. once you finish recording you instantly get a link to the already processed video to share. no waiting time. seems like it lets you edit the video as well.

2. github.com/justinfrankel/licecap -> similar to the above, allows you to record a part of your screen in giphy. no audio/cam though. great tool

3. https://www.teamviewer.us/ -> for realtime support, install it on your parents laptop and then whenever they have trouble just take control of their desktop remotely and do it for them. brute force that shit

4. have parents that understand tech -> apparently it's more effective than all of the rest combined",8
"(illinois) neighbor, cut down a rare 150-year-old tree that has been in my family for generations.. recently a great aunt of mine died, and we needed to send a week in washington state, and we asked a neighbor to take care of our five cats, two dogs, and 100+ chickens. we came back this morning and my parents had dropped me off at school this morning straight from the airport before heading home. while my dad was inspecting the property, he noticed that our 150-year-old giant sequoia was gone. my great-great grandfather had planted the tree after returning from california, and it's not native to northern illinois but with the right care it can survive, you just have to be careful about windburn in the winter. now the tree itself isn't that large because it's still young and the winters here (like this one that won't end because we have fucking snow in april) stunt its annual growth. upon the first confrontation, the neighbor admitted he had cut it down but upon further questioning will say nothing/denies doing it at all and my parents really have no idea what to do from here, and i want to be able to help them.

"update: for wanting to share the hotel room i booked with my girlfriend rather than sleeping with my friend who will go through a break up before our planned trip?. sorry for being a savager, here's the link: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bdrxjd/aita_for_wanting_to_share_the_hotel_room_i_booked/

hello, its been a few months since my last post but i thought that i'd give you an update. so, naturally, i talked to my so the day after i posted this on the subreddit. she recently joined this subreddit so she'll probably recognise this post (if you see this, i love you very much <3). 

i expressed my concerns for the break up and how it would affect our vacation together, specifically the room arrangements and told her of my conversation with my friend. she basically said what you guys did: we have no obligation to rearrange our trip for their comfort if they're going to break up, so i shouldnt feel obligated to give up our room together for that. they, especially my friend, has the responsibility to work out something. we agreed that it's a weird situation overall, but with her support i felt even more confident.

well, my friend and his gf broke up as expected a few weeks after i made the post. i casually confronted my friend some time afterwards. like, ""oh by the way when we talked about you wanting to change the room arrangements. we're not really up for that, so if you can find another option then that'd be swell."" more or less. he took it well and said he understood of course, but his gf ultimately wouldn't be joining us even though all of us said she was welcome to do so and that she could find another room or hotel but it was her choice. we all agreed that it was his responsibility to find another person to join us if he didn't want to pay that much. he took responsibility for it which i really appreciated, but in the end he had to pay the full price. she still had to pay for the plane ticket and the activities we were supposed to go on, but she said it was easy to earn back and didn't hold a grudge. we're still very good friends to this day.

overall, we had a good time on our trip. although our friend was  single and wanted to explore the night life more, me and my partner enjoyed our time together in our hotel room and the public areas, we had a blast! we also connected a bit more with my friend over drinks and fun days. so everything turned out alright in the end. thank you for all the responses that made me realize that i need to work on my confrontation skills and express my boundaries for my own, and my partner's, interests. i'm hoping that this post will encourage others in my shoes to do the same and hopefully come to a solution as friends and adults. be respectful, understanding, and don't forget that we all have issues that we struggle with. best is to encourage growth to strengthen ourselves and our relationships.",3
