"for ""tattling"" on my boyfriend to his mother my boyfriend and i have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. he'll sit on the couch and play video games and he'll only tend to her while she's screaming if i tell him to. even then, unless i'm in the middle of doing something right then, he'll ask me why i can't just do it instead. on top of that, he only holds her if i hand her to him while he's watching tv and she's calm. he stays up late playing video games but still won't get her when she cries, so i have to get up with her. we've talked about it multiple times, to the extent that i've told him i can't handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

i'm honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. i put the baby in his gaming room and told him i was going out. in reality, i just went to the gas station because i felt like i couldn't trust him, and sure enough when i got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. i took a ~10 second video of this and after i comforted the baby, i sent it to his mother with an explanation of what's going on.

she called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he's upset with me for involving his mother and for ""taking a video out of context."" i'm at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but for sending the video?

edit: the pregnancy was an accident but my boyfriend wanted me to keep it.",3
"reddit culture is cringey and fucking annoying. the ""thank you kind stranger"" shit, the comment threads that build on some reference or pun where everyone adds some kind of variation, the replies that are just a subreddit name like r/rareinsults and r/whoosh, all of it is fucking annoying. it's like watching poorly socialized people attempt to make some kind of ""cool kids club"".

i'd like to add a point that u/jarrodnb brought up. reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely ""oof"", ""yikes"", and ""le"" (""doggo"" and ""pupper"" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). expanding on what i said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. it's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.",6

"not sure how to deal with my 37f anti-vaxx husband 35m since i want to get our kids vaccinated at first i assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  we were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

it's been 6 years. six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

first, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

at 1 year i pushed to vaccinate but was met with his ""uncertainty."" 

today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and i decided to take her to the er.  

thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

he said all the things i've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. he explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

i tried to explain that i agree, but i feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes i was respecting up until now.

he ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

on the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

i look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

i won't do this anymore. although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

can i just take them myself?  we always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

what can i say so he won't go? how can i keep this form him, or should i tell him once it's done?

reddit i need encouragement and suggestions what to do. 

please help

if i was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. help me help my children this is no different. for those of you that have always agreed with your spouse on this, you are lucky. i thought he would eventually let them get vaccines but now it's just excuse after excuse.",8

"my (25 f) boyfriend (24 m) of 5 years just disclosed to me that he does not believe women should be allowed to vote. update: hi everyone, i had no idea that this post would gain this much traction. i'm sorry that i haven't been responding, i posted late-ish last night and have been at work today so i haven't had a chance to read the majority of the comments that have poured in. i am still at work so i won't have time until later to read through everything.
i wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. it has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt i have been facing. he really had me questioning this entire situation and whether i was overreacting or not. i am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. i can update again afterwards.
thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. even if my opinion isn't valid to him, at least it's valid to all of you!


i don't want to cause any political debates. if it's necessary for context: obviously i believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

i'm so confused, i don't know what to think. i'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but i just feel that i need some advice.

in the time i have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so i thought. politics was never an issue between us at all. however he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are american) and that they should not be allowed to vote... he says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

i'm upset and i can't tell if i'm wrong to be upset about this because i know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now i just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. he has assured me that he still thinks that i should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

this is a person i have been with for almost 5 years. we've talked about marriage. i don't know what to think. in all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and i can't imagine my life without him in it. but this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

am i wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? as his girlfriend am i supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though i may (strongly) disagree? i can't tell if i'm overreacting to this or not. the whole situation has made me feel terrible and i'm so confused.",8

"update my 30m wife 29f more or less abandoned me and the kids, with nothing more then a note. i don't know what to do. here is my original post:  here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0c1kd/my_30m_wife_29f_more_or_less_abandoned_me_and_the/)

i wanted to thank everyone for your help. this isn't a super happy post, but i felt the need to update. 

a few days after i posted that, i got a call from her parents it turns out she took her own life, she left a written message for me and the kids in english that was basically consisted of her apologizing, and going in great lengths about how she didn't understand who she was anymore. but she thanked me and told me she loved me.

the funeral was held in korea last week, i went with the kids. her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. they also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

however this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. even then there is a big language barrier between us. my ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them. 

i still have a huge amount of stuff to mentally unpack, and figure out however i am not panicking for money right now. i don't really know how to feel about this at all.

"aita? my husband and i are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. his mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but i don't want to do that. my stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and i decided that we will be getting him a car. i make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. that's fine with me.

his mother is a woman who i make the effort to be civil with but don't like. i am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. she called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. we are not friends and i won't even describe her as nice to me.

when my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

i don't want to do that. i don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. i don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but i don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

i don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. and i don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

i know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. i'm civil to his mom and i never talk negatively about her to him. is that not enough? am i incapable of being a good step mother to him if i'm not best friends with his mom? do i have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",3

"we need to stop telling kids they can be whatever they want to be. hold up, just hear me out. i'm not saying we should destroy the dreams of kids, but i'm absolutely in favor of not over-inflating a child's hopes to the point where they can't cope with any future failure.

we should be realistic with children from a very young age. say things like, ""you can do so much"", ""the future has so many possibilities for you"", anything else besides the false promise of ""you can be literally anything you want to be""

i think it would help kids understand that while they have so much potential, there are some things they can't control.

"for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does? background: i graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. my sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. we both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. i pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

this is a throwaway and it's still fresh and i'm really emotionally charged right now. last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. i overheard and i offered to help by paying more in rent (i was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. my parents were grateful. now, prior to this, i never asked my how much sister pays in rent. i always figured my parents charged us the same. so absentmindedly i asked a follow-up question.

me: how much is my sister paying for rent?

my mom: nothing.

a long ass pause.

me: what do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

my dad (visibly angry): your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

my dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. she doesn't pay rent. she doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. so for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while i've been paying my parents.

so later that night we had a family sit down talk. my sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much i was paying. she offered $100. my parents suggested she pay $300, i pay $800 which my sister and i both rejected.

the conversation ended with this:

sister: **fuck you. i'm trying to live my life.** these were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

so my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. i'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. my mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

so i say my part before leaving.

me: i'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (it's only fair right?) and if i do pay rent, i pay whatever she's being.

my mom: what if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

me: no.

my mom: but me, we really need the money...

me: that's too bad.

i get up and go off to my room.

so this morning my dad comes in tells me that i'm an asshole for not paying rent. that i should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. i'm like, ""what the hell? make my sister pay rent!""

my mom, who's listening in.

""you've seen her! she won't listen to us!""

me: well that's too bad.

my mom (really angry): well we wouldn't have this problem if you didn't try to make your sister pay rent.

that was the last straw that blew it for me. i slammed the door on my parents.

as i'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. like wtf?",3
"for calling a pregnant woman a c***? i was at the bookstore the other day and as i approached the cash i saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

as i got closer i listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. she was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn't available at the store. she was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn't available. the girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and i could tell she felt bad. when the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a ""inconsiderate little bitch"". as the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said ""what's the point of customer service if they won't help you?"" 
at this point, i had felt horrible for the young girl and i knew i had to say something. so i looked at the woman and i said ""i just hope whatever you give birth to isn't a total c*** like his mom"". the woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. i said i didn't care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. she cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. he came in, didn't say much (i'm 6'2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. as she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

now, i still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that i was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. i felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. the cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. she thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so i think she's ok. 

ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

i still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying i was wrong in using the c word?

edit: a few people have mentioned that i should not have included the hijab comment. it was not my intention to mention her religion for brownie points, i meant that it was very upsetting to see her trying to hide the fact she was crying because she was so embarrassed, and she didn't even have the chance to get a kleenex because this woman was just relentlessly going after her. sorry if it came across as pandering. was not my intention.

"by masturbating too hard which led to having surgery obligatory this didn't happen today but when i was in the 8th grade.

8th grade was about the first time i discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (whatever year they show the ""birds and the bees"" movie at school) well, needless to say, i was all for it. i think i did it just about everyday after school. and i was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.

one day in particular though, i wanted to see how fast i could do the deed. so after school i ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. i counted down from three and went full speed. let's just say i was a little too rough with my ding\-ding.

after i beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times i had ""spatooshed"". i just assumed i over\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so i laid down on my bed to take a nap. the tightness never went away so i had a hard time falling asleep. the tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.

i was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. i told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (i failed to mention that my dangly bits hurt a little bit too) so my dad, being the classic mexican dad that he is, just said ""just drink this 7up and take some tums and you'll be fine in no time."" unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says ""thats it, i can't take it anymore. we're going to the hospital.""

oh. my. lanta. talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  i thought i was going to pass out from the pain. this was my new worst pain of my life.

we eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. i tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. i didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\-dangle. so they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. at this point it's been 2\-3 hours since i got there so i say screw it and i finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum ""hey mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda."" right away she yells why didn't you say something?! then she calls a nurse to take a look.

the nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then manhandles my beanbags! for those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. so this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! i scream in pain. now, i would never hit a woman in my life but i would be lying if told you i didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. haha. remember when i said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.

the surgery was quick and i didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. they went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. i just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then i was back to ""normal"". well, because righty decided to take a left turn at albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. this means righty shrunk. like a lot. lets just say lefty towers over the little guy now. could be worst though. the doctor said 30 more minutes and i would've lost him.

i ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. rob and big, dr. evil and mini me, pinky and the brain are some of my favorites. lol.

lesson to be learned here: some things are meant to be taken slow.

tl;dr  wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.

"for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her african american boyfriend to her grandparents? let me just preface this by saying this: **i have absolutely no problem with interracial relationships.** now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

my daughter (anna) has recently started to date an african american man (jamal). while i'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, i'm happy. the problem is anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. while her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. as i said, i have no problem with mixed relationships and i've set them straight, but i am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

my parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and anna expressed a desire to introduce jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. i told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. i may have no problem with jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. they might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. anna was extremely upset by this and implied i was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

as i said, i know my parents. they simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if anna were to bring jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

anna is currently staying with jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. my wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when i introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend i confided in told me that i have behaved like an ass and that i needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

i sadly don't have any good news. just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. the camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

the place wasn't like anything i imagined it would be. i tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. they also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. whatever you do they see it as resistance. their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. even when i was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. it took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that i'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. i got to the point that i didn't care about anything anymore, i just wanted it to end.

they knew about my youtube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. they had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if i truly hate my old self or not. she'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also youtuber) and i was supposed to agree with her, if i took things personally they knew i was acting and wasn't ready.

they got me when i was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. the next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. i was thinking all the time and effort i placed there was gone.

from there i didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. so things became easier. they'd teach me to be a nice girly christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. it was like they were sending me into a children's book. then my dad came and brought me back home.

when i got back my brother actually told me that my youtube account wasn't deleted. since i was using his email for recovery he got a notification when i logged in from the camp because it was a new place. so he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. so my account is intact. the assholes at the camp were lying.

i don't know if i'm the same person or not or how much i've changed but i really hate my parents. i hate them so much that a year ago i couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. there are 448 days until i'm 18 and i'm counting every single day until this is over and then i'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

my big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who i trust. when i was gone he went to police, cps, even talked to a lawyer and a pi to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. my parents came after my $15,000 which i had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. but my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. he continued to post the videos that i had prepared in the pipeline when i was gone so i continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

that's it for me. from what i understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",2

"by applying for engineering jobs and telling employers i'm retarded so this has been going on since i graduated in may and started applying for jobs. i've submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and i have not had much feedback. well the vast majority of these jobs have you check boxes with disabilities you may have and since i have adhd, i have been checking the box marked ""intellectual disability"" all these months.

"i called 911 for a medical emergency and the police showed up and verbally harassed/threatened me. should i file a complaint? (pennsylvania) i don't really know where to file this under flairs.

tonight, i had to call an ambulance to my apartment. my boyfriend was acting erratic and seemed to be in psychosis. he then had a full-on seizure. 

later on, i found out he smoked synthetic marijuana. i don't know much about that. i do not do drugs. i do not even smoke normal marijuana. i called an ambulance because i didn't know what else to do - i was scared. 

three policemen showed up first and entered without knocking. asked where he was. i started to cry and they told me to go in the other room as i was annoying them. i complied. then, the larger of the three cornered me in the hallway.

he said my pupils were completely ""blown"" and i better start telling the truth about what drugs i do. i told him that i have incredibly poor eye sight and my pupils have been naturally large since childhood - this is true. he told me, ""stop fucking lying to me now or you're getting arrested for drug possession."" again, i denied any drug use and told him he could literally drug test me through blood and urine at that exact moment - i am clean. he left me in the hallway and another man came out, rinse and repeat. then the third did the same thing. they kept telling me to look at lights and laughing and saying i was the biggest liar they had ever met. at this point i'm amped up and scared. i am a 23 year old woman. i am in nursing school. i do not do drugs.

at this point, they have the ems there coming or and checking my pupils and laughing. they were telling my boyfriend that he better rat on both of us or we were both going to jail. they ripped apart my whole entire room and starting laying into me for having cipro prescribed (an antibiotic). the largest policeman then told me he was going to speak to my landlord and have me evicted.  i reiterated that i am completely clean and could pass not only a field sobriety test but a drug test of any kind. he retorted with ""i highly doubt that"" as he continued to tear apart my home.

eventually, they got my boyfriend into the ambulance and all three of the cops left laughing. the largest turned around and said, ""congratulation on ruining your life. don't call an ambulance when you are on drugs, i'll see you around"".

not only am i shaken, but i feel threatened and ashamed. the man i was with should not have been on anything, but i called an ambulance because i was scared he might die! i didn't call them to be harassed. did they even do anything really wrong that i can report this? we live in a small town in nepa. i know that they heard a possible drug incident over the scanner and had three of them show up because they thought they'd find a good amount of drugs/an incident of interest. they found absolutely nothing. no one got arrested or charged. they also refused to give me any badge numbers and told me if i kept inquiring i'd be in more trouble.

"watching incest porn *throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

this happened yesterday. i was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. i will state, for the record, i do not advocate incest. my girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. all i wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so i went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. that's all this was. research. 

so, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. of all people. if there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment i look straight into it. i answered the phone. the old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

cut to my dad and i driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. then, there came the silence. it wasn't the awkward kind. but i guess we just kinda said enough at the time. my father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. he was in the mood to get jiggy with jeezy. but instead of hearing voices worshipping the og upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital q&a: 

*""you like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

my old man unknowingly activated the car's bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever i was listening to last. in this case, it was fucking incest porn. now, i never closed the video before i left the house, but i did pause the motherfucker. yet, somehow, my phone went skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

i frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what i do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost.

"31m husband cheated on 27f me with his fit and skinny gym friend i came home from work early (i'm an ob nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. at that point, i sort of already knew what i'd be walking into. my husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. she's beautiful and thin and everything i am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. so, i talked to him about it. he encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

i walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. they were having sex. in our bed. with a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. i silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and i've returned to the hospital. he called me asking why i wasn't home and i told him my shift is extended but in reality, i'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as i type this.

i feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. i don't even know how to proceed. on one hand i want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, i'm an ugly woman....its not like i can do better. i just want to die. i feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. advice please.

edit: thank you all for the kind comments and support. please stop commenting, however. i think i've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). i don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. i still have no idea what i am going to do and i know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. he was a great husband and i can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. i don't know if i will stay, but that's all i really know right now.

"a 15 year old girl made false allegations to cps about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter. my daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. i don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know i was talking about them. 

the girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... she just has delusions of grandeur). the mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

i will refer to the mother as lorrie and the daughter as katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying katy. the assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss katy. i'm not sure if lorrie had anything to do with the cps report but i can not contact her directly. lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. i tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. my daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that katy said and i advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. when the friendship fell apart, katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. my daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

one of the things katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and i remembered it pretty vividly. my daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

a few days ago, cps knocked on our door while i was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what katy was saying about him at school a few months ago. there is no one else who could have made this complaint. it was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. my husband said the cps employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. i wasn't there so i don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

the problem is i have no proof. the assistant principal at my daughter and katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around katy when she made these comments about my son so i might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

what should i do? is there anything i can do? do i even have a leg to stand on? all i have is my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids. 

any advice is welcome. i'm terrified.

i am in va.

edit: i'm not looking to sue anyone or anything. i just want to clear all of this up and i want katy to be held accountable for making a false report. the things she reported could potentially hurt my son's reputation and damage his future. the allegations were not about me or my husband being neglectful or abusive. they were accusing my son of doing horrible things that he did not and would never do.",2
"making a public tweet about someone sexually abusing you isn't brave, go to the police. if you're ""brave"" enough to come forward and accuse someone publicly and have your followers shame them but don't have the balls to file an official police report than chances are you're full of shit.

edit: i wrote this late. my wording shouldve been ""making a tweet instead of going to the police""

2nd edit: to clear things up a bit with a bit of context since a lot of people have taken this personally. ive seen a lot of people share their stories about their crappy experiences with cops but you guys at least tried which tells me that an actual crime happened. i'm talking about the people that don't even attempt to go to the cops and yet have no issue coming out on twitter and using their followers instead.
recently in the voice acting scene a popular va has been accused of sexual assault because he gets affectionate and hugs all his fans and sometimes pecks them on the cheek. hes now being fired from everything and some of his fellow vas are coming out saying that he sexually assaulted them too. they havent tried going to the police nor have they said anything other than the blanket term ""sexual assault"" which these days could be a hug. 
i've seen people say ""wow seeing this backlash i can see why its hard for women to come forward"" theres a big difference between going to the police and making a report and publicly going after someone that has a dedicated fan following. 
apparently this has been happening for years but no one got a restraining order against him and no one is getting specific on what it is they did. they're ""brave"" enough to use a blanket term but they don't have the balls to say whether it was rape,grope etc and then they wonder why so many people don't believe them.

"private driveway being used as public roadway and im being accessed for its upkeep (fl) purchased 30 acres of land and built a house several years back in central florida, had a driveway installed that cuts across the center of my property allowing me to exit on either of two main roads.

i now have traffic using my driveway as a shortcut between the two roads up to and including 18 wheelers and other large vehicles since using my driveway cuts off nearly half an hour of travel time between two cities.

i installed pillars and gates on both ends of the driveway and marked it private property but the gates were torn down and the pillars knocked over.

i have contacted the county about it and they sent out a guy from code compliance who looked around for a few minutes and left.

i have now received a notice about not keeping the roadway to state standards and that the county will be out to perform maintenance bringing the roadway up to standards, ie. widening it and repaving which i will be personally responsible for paying for.

ive told them if they want it to be a public road then fine buy me out and ill move elsewhere but they refuse to do so.

as of right now i have removed half the driveway past my house and put up signs and markers stating dead end road and now the county is threatening to have me arrested for destruction of public property.

before anyone asks, no, there are no easements on this property anywhere near the area the driveway goes through and no easements in any form that travel in that direction on the property, closest thing is a power company easement along the southern edge of the land.

"for not being attracted to my girlfriend's body? i made an alt account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
i'm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so i'll try to keep it as pg as i can.

so, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. we have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
i will say that she's the first thin person i've ever been with. she's flat, petite and pretty short. most of the girls i've been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and i've always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
this all started when me and my girlfriend were watching netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if i was okay with her having a flat chest. (she's always been insecure about not having b**bs.) i asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that i never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. that kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she's not attractive if she doesn't have a certain figure.) she said she was just curious.
i told her i had to be honest, and said that i'm not attracted to her chest size, and that i actually prefer bigger b-bs. it's not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. if i'm being honest, that's why i usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
she was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. she texted me later on that night and told me what i said hurt her a little. she said we've been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like i lied to her. i told her i didn't know what to tell her, and that i was just being honest (i was.).

am i being the asshole here?

honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman i loved could be so fucking heartless. so for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when i was home.

so i'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that i had since i was kid. 

she always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

but to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. he has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

when we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but i couldnt cuz i really love my snake.

well now i came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

when i confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

i find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and i doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

i dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

i wanna confront her about it but i dont wanna seem like im being petty

i never really liked john. he was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. he was also incredibly pretentious. a friend of mine said ""einstein"" once and john interrupted him to say, ""i have no idea who you are talking about. do you mean the reknown scientist albert einshtein?"". i once put up a snapchat story saying, ""i love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""it's called gridiron you moron"".  i don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

on one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. john was kind of tipsy. we had some new girls show up so i was kinda working my charm on them. they asked me what i did and i went ""i'm a biomed engineer"". i don't know why that triggered john so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how i'm just a drone in a rat race. he kept telling me about how i'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. he later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

every time i mention work or anything, john would start roasting me. he nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though i expressed multiple times that i dont like to be called a drone. he would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what i do. that really pissed me off. once i told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""what are you going to do, fight me? i dare you to swing"". i didn't want to fight him so now i started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

over the last few months or so i kinda went frontpage a couple of times on reddit and everyone was like, ""damn m0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). that triggered him even more. he'd say stuff like ""his posts suck. they're not even funny. reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


at this point it is relevant to bring up what john does. he's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at starbucks. how good is he? honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a dslr, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. i'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an instagram post about how national georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. at the party, i apologized to him (i hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""i'm sorry you didn't get nat geo"". to which he got angry again and said, ""i'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. what i'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so i actually feel sorry for you"". he said stuff like this in front of a girl i was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

that's it. i fucking lost it. we were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with john and i took that opportunity to say, ""well john, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder nat geo rejected you. you're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iphone camera. you're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *i get cut off here*"" 

his dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. john came charging at me but everyone just held him back. the rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and i got kicked out. no one has talked to me since the incident and john blocked me from all social media. our group chat has been pretty silent too. john also apparently made a roast post about me. idk if i should apologize to him or not. sorry for the long post. i know john is an asshole, but aita?

"by buying my mom an amazon device. i want to start by giving some background here. i basically live, eat, sleep and breath amazon. i need something, straight to amazon. i use kindle and audible daily. want to stream music, amazon music. want a new movie, prime video. run out of something randomly, ""hey alexa......."" laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. so when looking for a place to store photos, i see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with amazon photos"". naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. automatically upload photos from my phone? even better. 

rewind to september 25th, my mom's birthday. i thought about her gift for a while, but when i remembered she didn't have a smart tv, the answer was easy. i hop on amazon shopping and use my amazon credit card to purchase one firetv stick. she was so happy she could watch netflix on her tv now. yay, success! or so i thought. 

yesterday i get an email from amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the fire tv family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did i imagine that it would sign in to my amazon account without even asking for a password. surely she'd have to use her own account. 

fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. sitting in my mother's kitchen, i glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

i spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. i happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. i'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. i took probably 40 pictures that night for my so to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my entire family to view. i have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

nobody helped me. the remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where i'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. i didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, i just ran away. 

the worst part, i asked alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, i'm not sure about that."" fuck amazon.

update: i promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. i talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. however, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

i'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an amazon ad, i just wrote it how i wrote it because i thought it was funny. i wish amazon was paying me for this crap. 

i'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. yes i fucked up, i was a dumbass, that's why i posted it here. yes, i should have known this could happen. call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my so do. it's fun. i don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. it happened.

"by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong' this happened about a week ago. it still gives me shivers.

obviously, i never thought this would happen to me of all people.

i spent a lot of money on the app store and i think they blocked my card and so i had to call them up to restore my account.

a female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. even at this point i had no clue what was coming. until she asked,

""what is your most prized possession?""

i froze. my head goes blank not because i forgot what i had written for the answer, but because i knew exactly what i had written. the answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

i wanted to hang up right then and there, but i knew she was looking at the answer i had written.

so, i mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""i'm sorry? you have to speak up sir, i can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (fuck), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (fucking kill me)""

""dong schlong. thank you, sir.""

i was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

i've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and i had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

edit:

holy mother of schlong this blew up... thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

and yes, looking back, i should've definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. but this had never happened to me and i think i just panicked. i'll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.

"by letting my wife into the bathroom while i was taking a shower so we had just finished having a wholesome breakfast of eggs, potatoes and cinnabread my wife made and i hopped into the shower. when i shower i listen to a bluetooth speaker, mostly youtube. midway through my shower my wife unlocked the door and busted in claiming she had to pee. i'm a private person and always shower with the door locked, but obviously she isn't. after she finished she asked to come into the shower, but i was in the midst of shaving my legs (yes i'm a guy, i just don't like body hair) and told her no because i had a razor in my hand and our shower is a tiny two shoulder's width stall. she said fine and walked away. shortly after her departure my audio goes out, and i hear the sound of a cat meowing angirly into a microphone blare out of my speaker. this is followed by a series of animal noises and a slew of additional videos including such gems as ""top 3 minecraft songs"" and ""3 hours of farting."" sure enough, she'd stolen my phone. i got out of the shower when she started blasting victory royal fanfare and when she saw me she started dabbing furiously and ran away. this behavior continued for at least ten more minutes before i was finally able to get my phone back.

edit: first time using reddit, color me impressed. i did not expect this to get nearly the attention that it did and thanks very much to the lovely people who gave me the silvers and the gold! this is not an isolated incident, if my wife finds that i've left my phone unattended while she suspects my headphones are in she will steal it and my music will be instantly cut off and replaced. her go-to video is '3 hours of farting' and her stated goal is to one day have me make it through the entire video in this manner. i am extremely aware that she is an absolute gem of a woman and i'm very grateful to have her in my life, thanks to those of you who've pointed that out. for those of you 
asking, shower sex was not an option. our shower is smaller than the tiny shower stalls you'd find in the changing rooms at your local beach. we've done shower sex before, it's a miserable experience, shampoo bottles falling all over your ankles, would choose a bed every time.

"girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time"" so before your read, i need to say i have nothing against cuddling to sleep. i actually love it.

the problem i have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

and honestly i wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

but no, she doesn't want it like that. she absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

if i just start to get sleepy (wich i am because i want to sleep), she will get upset.

she absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because i have to keep my eyes open too.

she also needs sweet talk, wich i like but not when it's forced like that. she literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""i love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what i think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... and honestly i have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. and we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like i never say it.

but the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. and that can take some time. sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

i know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with so, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when i tell her i'm tired and i want to sleep.

if i say i'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""no ! don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so i have no say in it.

seriously, i think she's just being too clingy and childish. is it unreasonable to just say ""good night i love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? i don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if i don't do enough.

i feel like i have no control over when i can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for several hours.

honestly i wish i could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but i can't. it's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when i'm tired.

could i have some insight ? what do you think ? am i being unreasonable ?

thanks for reading.

**edit: thank you very much to all of you guys, your comments and insights have been really helpful, i will continue to read your replies and answer some of your question. i feel a lot better about the whole thing, and now i'm confident about moving forward and putting a stop to all this. i will talk to her and make her understand that she needs therapy if she wants to make it work.**

i did speak to a lawyer for 30 minutes who said i didn't have much to fight for. the ""online"" courses were not online. it meant my normal classes that were lecture based could provide me info vis email. it wasn't a set up online course and 4 of my 5 professors didn't have any way to provide online lecture info. and even so, only one class provided me resources. the dean did not provide any info even after emails from me asking for it.

i was banned from campus following allegations against me. i was accused of sexual misconduct and assault charges. the allegations not only never happened but i have never even met this person for longer than 5 minutes at a party.

i was brought into the dean's office with officers in the room who showed me the charges. i told them i had no idea what they were coming from and i barely know this person. they still issued a no trespassing issue until ""further investigation"".

i was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. i am a senior and about to graduate. they reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. they only gave me info for one class. then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. and another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. despite this i am still ""under investigation"".

"for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time? i was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. at a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

as i was near, i rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

when she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me i'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

i said ok, i just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" i dont need your help"", again super angry. 

i wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but i was the first one, cause i was sitting right by the restroom

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

"for not paying for the meal? on a road trip last week, my girlfriend and i stopped at a rural diner for brunch. we sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). it was a very nice meal honestly. our total was around $25. i was ready to pay with my debit card.

the waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. unfortunately i had zero cash on me. ""how were we supposed to know?"" i asked. she shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. there was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

she sighs and points to an atm on the other side of the dining room. at this point i'm still apologetic so i went there with my card. i noticed it had a fee of, i shit you not, $9. i asked to speak to the manager. she brought the owner.

i told the owner this is ridiculous. i suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that atm. nope. he threatened to call the police. i said go ahead. my girlfriend felt the same way. long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

i told my sister about this today. she thinks the cops were wrong and i was being an asshole. because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" i think the owner is the asshole. the only part i regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

"for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""? using a throwaway. some context; i live in ca, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. she's 22, i've known her since she was 4. her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. she's very sheltered by her mother. anyway, i told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. she's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

but then my wife goes, ""and she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

i'm 41, my wife is 42. i was like ""you're kidding, right?""

she wasn't kidding. at first, i was like ""hell no."" but after about a week of talking, i gave in....with one caveat. i told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, i'm going to ask some questions he might not like. she wanted to know what kind of questions, and i gave her some.

1. how did you guys meet and who made the first move? (if the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. what's the end game here? a serious relationship, marriage? have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

i know, i'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

so, fast forward to the visit. niece and old dude show up. i'm cordial. i wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and i invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. just me and him. then i start asking my questions. 

after only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. he told me this is ""none of my business."" i got a little pissed at that. 

i told him he's staying in my home for a week, i can ask him a few questions. and the girl is my niece, i'm not out of bounds here. he told me i was making him ""uncomfortable"". i replied that i'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. i said you can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

well, he left. my wife and niece were upset with me. they said i acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. again, i was told it's none of my business. they have since broken up, which i am glad about. not sure if my actions were the cause.

so am i an asshole for questioning this guy?

edit: some info:

i asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

i would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

when i took the old dude outside for a beer, i neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. we discussed the new star wars movies of all things.

i would love to discuss more with some of you, but i was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. so it goes.

he recently passed, which sucks. then i learned he left me a little something. that little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since i had no idea he had that kind of money. that 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. so it's not like i'm getting the majority of his estate. but then his son, who i'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  i ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




i have three things going for me:




1. my friend was mentally acute. he had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. our town's not big, and i know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. hell, i even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. these people can be witnesses i think, though i don't know how civil suits work.


3. his adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. she came around from time to time, and knew her dad and i hung out and stuff. the first time i met her, her dad and i were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the south so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





basically, my point is he and i were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? also, what kind of lawyer should i hire? the lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but i don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





edit: you guys were right. the son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. the letter had a bunch of legal terms, so i didn't get the gist when i first read it. i'll be contacting a lawyer asap.",2
"for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (about $700) i had a party at my house last night. i have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. my step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but i'm not a casino and while i'm not destitute, i can't afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

so was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

edit: sorry guys i can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because i've been banned.

edit2: wow since i'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) i might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. i'm really that bad? i just thought i had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>if this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. forget our votes, listen to those. also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

if the moderators allow me to update, i will absolutely update and tell you how many friends i've lost. almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. and he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). in addition, i will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (az) and ask what trouble i might be in. i will also update on that when i can. people can't be this dramatic in real life...i'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and i'm still blown away by some of these comments. call me yta all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

edit4: well i was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  makes info hard but i'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why i can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? another friend says wow, that's cool i have $1.25 in my pocket, can i donate to your change jar? you'd say yes. now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey i just put .80 into your change jar, now i'm taking the whole thing."" you would say no. it's how i've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. i've given people quarters to play, i've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. i've taken in maybe $100 over five years. maybe. that's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


edit5: a good question:

>info did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? if no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

no he did not, the first time i ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  i don't mind if people play it, i even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

edit6: another good question

>also, need more info. you stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). did you let them keep it? if so, why are you making a double-standard here?


i would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. i do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why i'm asking here. but i do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits i wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

edit7: 

>info
we need to know where the money came from. did the money in the machine come from you putting it in or playing the machine

so this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). she said it gets full at $800. it was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, i always guessed $500. in five years it's now 7/8ths full. i play it from to time to time so i'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. i think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night i've ever seen that window empty. i know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so i may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if i'm way off base.

edit8: this is the best yta take so far and i can't let it get buried.

> i really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. i love the comments that say ""your edits make you yta! alone. where did the money come from btw?""  i truly can accept the yta votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. i wasn't profiting off this machine. i've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. i can't afford to give a random dude $700. i don't need it now, but i have savings account i don't need it now either but i might some day. and now i've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. so good thing i hung onto them right ? (i can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. i never cleaned it out because honestly i like the way it looked with the coins in the window. this thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. some nice ntas have suggested i have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. i actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (i got it five years ago) so i always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. as an example, over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. i had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. he was heartbroken when he didn't win (i might have given it to him since he was so cute) but i gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so i always, always give people money back if they ask. i never intended to profit off the machine. no one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>i bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who dm'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, i was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. my slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said i could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. in my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. so it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. there wasn't a jackpot at all. i don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. the guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  i still don't care if i'm yta till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. and fuck that guy.


edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that i will not be allowed to update this post. so the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. so had i been a real casino i would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. so yeah, i was totally in the right. fuck this sub. fuck the moderators. and fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. most of you however were cool.",3

updated post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9xps88/update_on_im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how/)

i was going to make this an edit but due to its length, i figured to make it a separate post. i don't even know if this is relevant to this subreddit anymore, but i sincerely apologize if i am in the wrong.

i just wanted to address some common questions, and to clear up some things i've mentioned in the comments briefly. i hope this post is a little more coherent and organized than my previous ones.

but before i do that, i want to thank everyone who sent me a dm, inboxed me, or commented, offering to talk or giving me advice. i've read through all of them, but i haven't gotten around to replying, but regardless, thank you so so soo much. you have no idea how much it actually means to me, and how much i appreciate it. i love you all <3

# quick update:

i texted kyle yesterday and he replied. i asked him how he was feeling. he said he was even more sick than earlier. i said i was too, and i said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). i told him about how i had a volunteer thing at university which i went to and how i nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. but that was it. we didn't talk about much else because he stopped responding.

in addition to this, i haven't called the number my ta gave me because they are only open monday - friday from 8am to 4pm. so, i'm going to be doing that on monday, hopefully.

# my condition:

the exact name for my condition is mayer-rokitansky-küster-hauser syndrome, or mrkh syndrome for short. it affects 1 in every 5000 women. a lot of people, i'm assuming they were trolls, stated that i was a guy or something along those line. just to clarify, i am a woman, i look like a woman physically and i've felt like a woman my whole life. i was genetically born with xx chromosomes. being a woman is not something i doubt.

there are basically 2 types of branches within mrkh. type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. this may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. i have type 1. there are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. i am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# diagnosis:

a lot of people were confused as to why i was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did i find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

the way mkrh works is that it affects internal reproductive organs. this means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. from the outside, i look like a normal female. i have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. i am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. my ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why i am still physically able to look like a female. for me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, i have something called an indentation or 'dimple'. for 18 years of my life, i lived thinking i was just like any other girl. i never once suspected anything wrong.

when i started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. but this was around the time i started to feel like something was wrong. one main reason was that i hadn't started my period, and the second being the fact that i wasn't able to insert a finger inside my vagina. for some reason, at the time, i assumed periods and fingering went together. i thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina ""opened"" and the barrier fell out or something like that. its weird looking back at that now haha.

i went to the doctors one day (this was before i started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. this is probably one of the most common ways women with mrkh find out about it. the doctors simply assumed that i was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. i was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. i was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. the following year, i got my shit together on my own. i joined the wrestling team, track team, and i started doing weight training. as a result of this, i was also eating way more, and i gained a lot of muscle mass. i got my weight up to 120lbs. when i still hadn't gotten my period, i went back to the doctors. they still didn't take it too seriously, telling me that some women don't get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. i had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. i didn't feel like everything was normal, so i switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. needless to say, i was getting tired of blood tests because i knew they didn't show anything. one doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but i think that was circumstantial. prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that i had breast discharge which is something i had never experienced before in my life. some how, i can't exactly remember which doctor, i ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to ""reset"" my biological functions and induce a period. i diligently took the bc pills every day. nothing happened. this is when i thought, ""is it just me or does healthcare in canada suck?"".

then another doctor suggested i get a pelvic ultrasound done. this is when they found the issue. the poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn't even exist. the doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. she stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom i had mrkh. she said according to the ultrasound i had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). she literally didn't even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. i walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. his response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and i could hear him. and then he said, ""its okay, just forget it"". i came home, and i did some googling and started to learn more about mrkh. i had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and i texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. i also added that if it changed anything between us, that i would understand, and i wouldn't hold it against him. as much as i might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something i really needed at the time.

after the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a sickkids hospital in downtown toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. they started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. they had me get an mri done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an mri. i also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). doctors aren't allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. i ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because i didn't have one. the look on their face was hilarious as i'm sure they probably never heard of my condition either. after i met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, i was properly informed that i did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but i was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. i was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. they had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. the depth of it was about 3mm deep. it was actually quite painful, and i hated doctors by this point anyways.

# family situation:

my parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are highly taboo. everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn't know english well so most of the time when i went to the doctors, i went with my dad. it was very weird and awkward. the few times my dad refused to go with me, i went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

after my last appointment with sickkids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. my dad took those from me and threw them out, saying i didn't need them. they also asked if i would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that i didn't it. going to therapy at the hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. i can't drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which i don't particularly mind doing if it helps me, but i don't have time due to school. i actually got a letter from the hospital in september about a pretty cool mrkh conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. i really really wanted to go. but again, it was far. i figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, i could definitely bus there. the event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. it was unrealistic for me to go. so then i told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. they'll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" i tried arguing that it was exactly the opposite of that, and that they want to inform you that you are women despite the lack of certain organs. they responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) i had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

i had someone telling me that i need to stand up to my parents. my parents aren't the issue, but my dad is. unfortunately, due to the circumstances that i don't particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something i refuse to do. i am well aware of the shitty situation i am in. i know they are being abusive, in more than one way. i've thought long and hard about it, and i've come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. i'm not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we're like a normal family. i've seriously taken everyone's well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# surgery:

i had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. in my first post, somewhere in the comments, i believe i said something along the lines of ""im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now"", as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why i can't get surgery yet. lucky for me, i live in canada and i have health insurance! surgery is definitely an option for me. but due to my family situation, they believe that i wont need surgery until after i get married because i mean its not like i'm going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# additional comments:

1. a lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that i could look into doing anal. it's all about personal preference, and i hate it. its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. i can look into the asexual community, but i am not asexual. i may not be able to satisfy my needs, but i do have a pretty high sex drive, and i do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. i don't know if i would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. a lot of people had a lot to say about how i handled the situation. some saying i did the right thing, and others saying i did it too soon. honestly, i haven't figured out the right way to go about it. i have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. i once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""aren't you surprised i still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" i was so taken aback by it, i didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. someone said that ""if a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, i'm sure its an important part of their life but it's a huge first date turn off. so he shouldn't disclose it on the first date"". true, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his ibs. i didn't disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was relevant to what was happening. i evaluated the situation i was in with kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so i had to tell him. agree or not, first date material or not, i'm going to stand by with what i did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. i am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest i do that, but you don't really know what its like until you're actually in the situation yourself. i don't want to publicly display it to guys i'm not interested in, nor to those who aren't interested in me. i know guys who also use those dating apps, and i don't want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. the guy i ended up calling on tuesday night, after i left kyle's apartment, he knows about my condition. he has told me that it wouldn't bother him. i had a lot of messages telling me that i shouldn't friend-zone him, and that i should give him a chance. here is the real reason why i'm not attracted him nor why i would never ever give him a chance: he's basically doing nothing with his life. he's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. whereas i on the other hand, i work part-time, i study my ass off in school, and i make time to do extra curricular stuff. i also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. but i treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. i'm not saying i'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am i saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. i'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and i'm not into that. in addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **""the other guy""**. he was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because ""he was lonely"". i was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, i am. there is no way i am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. i think one of the main reasons i even turned to reddit in the first place was because i am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and i don't want them finding out. there was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me i can't find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications i got.

this is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. i hope i answered some questions. i really do appreciate all the support i got. thank you, and take care everyone <3

edit: i'm only doing this to feel better about myself: kyle replied. ""i definitely do not want to get involved"". fuck you, kyle. if y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. i welcome it with open arms. 

edit: i think i forgot to address this earlier. for those of you asking whether i can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. my clitoris is underdeveloped. stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? i don't know. i haven't tried.

the googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until i had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out i pushed it even further in. i was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. i could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, i stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. after a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

skip forward to this tuesday;
i do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and i was submerged under water, after i emerged and pulled my boat out i could hear a slight rattle in my ear and i knew instantly what it was.
it's now friday and the rattling happens every time i turn my head and i still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

tldr: put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... it didn't

uptate:
so this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don't believe it, which is fair enough cause i think it's abit mental aswell.

however i'll get a doctor's visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and i'll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.

alot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and i can honestly say i don't have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think they're as big of thing in the uk.

thanks for hearing me out",4
"boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship my bf and i have been together for over 4 years. when we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. we stayed together long distance until i graduated and moved back home. we have lived together for about 2 years now. 

life was very rough for him when he dropped out. his parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. he is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. because of this, i have lent him money over the years. i was very fortunate in my situation where i went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. i have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. one thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. i am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. he told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. my perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (for example, we moved last week and i wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) it makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. but he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

i am very confused about our relationship right now. he will not remember this when he wakes up, but i don't know how to approach him with the things he said. i love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. but if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should i be doing?

edit: i've changed the ocd to perfectionist. i'm so sorry to everyone i offended!

a little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn't work. because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. that was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job.",8
"my girlfriend's dad just cut his thumb off with a bandsaw while working on a project. he is currently in surgery to have it reattached. what are some puns or jokes i can make when we see him this sunday? for the record, he loves dark humor and stupid puns. this isn't going to make him hate me. 

i have already decided when i see him, i'll be giving him a thumbs up and saying something like ""on the other hand, you're going to have a cool scar.""

what other stupid puns or dark jokes can be made about him cutting his thumb off?

"south park is vasty more intellectual than rick and morty. rick and morty is funny, and a good show. sure. but this underlying thought that it is somehow for intellectuals is absurd. i thought at first it was just a meme, something that would die off, but people still, and seriously, believe it is some how transcendent of the writing.

south park in the other hand is topical, witty, often delving into serious topics in a way that is so absurd and humorous that you don't notice how good the points they are making are until you think about it later. through crude antics and exaggerated perspectives they actually manage to say something substantial. not only that, but often they show just how absurd something is bringing an almost absolute clarity to the issue they are covering and thus it is hard to argue against it using what you may have thought before was a solid point. and they do it in a way anyone can understand and digest.",6
"i think my (22f) boyfriend (25m) mostly likes me because of my race. i've been seeing this guy for about 5 months. everything has been going really well so far.

i'm half japanese/korean and half white. for reference, i've been told by multiple people, including him, that i look like kiko mizuhara. (although i don't agree, i love the compliment btw)

so i've known since the beginning that he loves japanese culture. no biggie, whatever. i've dated weeaboos before, and it never turned into a problem. 
somehow my mom got brought up and how i'm more japanese than korean. he got weirdly excited. it kind of weirded me out, but i let it go.

then he said that i ""shouldn't call myself white"" because i'm hapa. that pissed me off, but i didn't make a big deal out of it. then he said something along the lines of ""you're so lucky you got the best features from both races"" and i was so grossed out.
it escalated, and it basically ended with me saying that i felt fetishized and then he sounded like he was into eugenics. he got angry because he said i called him a nazi. (i did not. i said what he said sounded like eugenics) he then proceeded to cry and say ""it's not my fault i have yellow fever"" and ""japanese girls are tighter and are more submissive""

i'm honestly afraid to tell our friends about it, but i'm pretty sure i'm done with him. i've had white guys do kinda racist stuff before, but never to this extent. all of our friends are white, and i'm afraid they'll think i'm overreacting or something. idk. i guess i'm just looking for some type of reassurance that what he said isn't okay. 
thanks

edit:
thank you everyone who responded. it really means a lot to me. to clarify, we had been drinking a little bit, but not that much at all. i have decided to completely end things. i'll never be able to think of him the same way, and it would always be in the back of my head. the friends i have spoken to totally agree with me. i feel so respected by them, and it means the world to me. so yeah, thank you all again. you all made this so much easier for me. i'm just so, so thankful to have all of these kind strangers support my decision!

edit 2: again, i just want to thank you all! i've blocked him number because he wouldn't stop calling me. my friends are being so supportive- just like you guys. honestly, i'm not super sad about it anymore. i feel like a dodged a huuuuuge bullet. and to those of you saying you hope this is fake.. i really wish it were too.

edit 3: wow! i really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did. again, thank you all. i'm trying to read all the responses because they all mean a lot to me. i just had a night out with a friend, and life feels good. thank you, strangers from the internet. <3

edit 4: i just realized someone gave me gold n silver! tbh, i don't really know what those mean, but thank you!!!! i'm in awe of how kind you all are, and you have seriously made this situation so much more manageable. i can't thank you all enough. i wish i could hug each and every one of you who gave me kind words and/or validation.

edit 5: hey you guys. just wanna give out another thank you. i wish i could read through everything, but i don't think i'll be able to! just wanted to clear some things up:

- to the people who are saying it's my fault for dating a white guy, that's bullshit. not all white people are inherently like this. 

- when i said weeaboo, i mostly meant people who like to watch anime and stuff like that

- i've had a few people message and say stuff like ""there's no way you look exactly like kiko..."" i didn't say i did. i said some people have told me that which is a huge compliment to me. i don't necessary think i look like her, but i do get where those people are coming from. 

- some people have asked to see a photo of me. venmo me and maybe i will lol

- to the people who are still insisting that this is fake, it's really not. reading through all of these comments, i'm pretty disgusted by how prevalent this issue really is

- i'm talking about our mutual friends. i met a couple of them through him. not all of my friends are white, and i knew that none of my personal friends would judge me

- and to the people who said he did nothing wrong, i disagree. i didn't take very much time to make my decision to end things, but i would never be able to see him the same way. the damage was done.

thank you all again.

edit 6:
okay, one more thing. i don't only date white dudes. race has nothing to do with who i'm attracted to.. seriously. i never said i only date white guys. he just happens to be white and our mutual friends are all white. the area that i currently live in is overwhelmingly predominantly white. i do not have ""white fever"", and i should not have expected this.

update 2: aa called me, apologized for the fa ""escalating out of control"". they will open an internal investigation. i conveyed that i don't want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 but that it's up to aa to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. i don't want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

she assured me that i won't get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me.

for those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - i'm a 120lb girl lol. i injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. it's just that i talked back (""no i don't but okay"") and i regret that so much.

update 1: thank you so much for your quick advice on a sunday morning! i memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

as we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

""the police will contact you when you get home. you will be banned from future flights."" 

""ok."" 

""oh i hope so."" as she walked away. 

i burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. she won. 

there was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my miranda rights. i made it home in one piece. still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future aa flights. i've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. my thanksgiving and holiday flights are both on aa. 

my seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. they gave me their business card in case i need a witness. 

thank you again for your helpful comments. i am not in jail (yet) at least!

original post: 

i can't believe this is happening to me. i'm flying from chicago to boston now and police are waiting for me when i land, so i don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

edit: i've looked all over the internet and can't find any faa rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

here's what happened:

..

i was on an american airlines flight from chicago to boston on november 3rd, 2019. because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, i use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. this sling is often advertised on facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. i am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""you have to put your feet on the ground!"" i cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""no i don't but okay."" as i put my feet down. emphasizing again. **i complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** although i had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights i've taken with my foot sling, i complied. i put my feet down immediately. 

even if it's technically not allowed by some rule i'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

she immediately escalated: 
""would you like to go back to the gate? we're gonna go back to the gate!"" and immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

but right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

she came back to my seat and barked: 
""police will be waiting for you when we land in boston.""

my seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. i had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no i don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

her statement caused me to panic inside. i'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

so i took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight.

"telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not why we are really afraid. anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the kavanaugh hearings. resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

the conversation went as such: if you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

yeah. no shit. the reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **or** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). so... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

what isn't outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. the implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* in effect, it was a lie by omission. 

and the above really isn't my point anyways. here's the main point:

*in a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. there are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

so, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* where's the deterrent there? 

another question that i have never once seen given a good answer:

how does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? this is how *most* consent occurs anyways. other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: intimacy with a woman. 

we have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

lastly: i want to be wrong. 

here's what you can do if i am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard i've found. 

i'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that i am *nowhere close* to being alone here. relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. you won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on facebook. talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on reddit at least.  

so, if i am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that i am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

edit- holy shit this exploded. thank you everyone! so it looks like i have some work to do(https://i.imgur.com/0fq8erf.png) and i will endeavor to answer comments and questions where appropriate today. :)",6

**original** 

i \42m\ am a single father to my daughter \14f\. my wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. she's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. she doesn't see too much of me because i work 9-7, but i'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

around tuesday, i noticed there was something off about her. she was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch tv together. i figured it was just moody teenage hormones. except it doesn't stop. friday i finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. she looked at me and just burst into tears. she cried more, so i held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""i'm pregnant.""

i was shocked. utterly and completely shocked. i kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. i took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. i didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, i'd wait until she calmed down a little. saturday she came down for breakfast and i sat her down and asked her her plans. she said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. i then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. i calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? i go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. she suggested she start online school, which i refused, saying i don't want her to ruin her life.

the thing is, i don't even want to consider adoption. i can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. i don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if i lose her?i told her this, and she asked me if i had no love for my grandchild. but i don't. i don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, i care about her. the girl i raised. i told her today that she had to abort her child. she cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. there's no way i'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. and for school, i don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

at this point, i see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, i'm kicking her out. it hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, i'm afraid her life will truly be over. i won't actually, but i'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. i'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do i get out of this?

where do i go from here?

tl;dr: my daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**update**

so today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. it's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. they said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

after the doctor's i took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. i told her i had to know, she had to tell me. she refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. we went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so i took it and looked through her messages. according to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. she hadn't told him yet.   
i wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him i was \daughter's name\ dad, and i needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. i expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so i called his mom and i told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. she asked if i was sure, and i said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. i said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. she said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. i asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. she asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. she hung up before i could say anything else. 

now i don't know where i stand. i can't afford a lawyer, and i don't think i can make him get involved either way. i don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. is there a way they could get out of paying it? i don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

my daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but i'm going to stop peppering her with it now. my sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and i hope a female influence will work better on her than i am. she's sending a little bit of money, and i think i may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and i can do.

"i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i don't know what to say to her. hey everyone. i don't know what to do in this situation because i never expected i'd face something like this. i'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but i'm coming up seriously short here.

i met my wife on tinder at the end of 2015. we talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. by the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. we were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. more than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

i know, heavy topics for a first date. we were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

at the very least i held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. she immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

we dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. after getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

four nights ago was the first time i ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. my wife was out with a friend, and i was doing some house cleaning. i was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so i took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. at the bottom i saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case b were visible. i immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

i had known that my wife was on her period because when i tried to initiate sex, she told me so. i found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and i made comment about the timing being odd. she told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. i figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

i haven't told her that i found the box. when she got home that night everything was so normal. i tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

the more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. what if she was assaulted? what if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? what if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? or, what if she just cheated? i only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of plan b and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

i don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. we have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. i've done nothing to displease her, at least that i know of. maybe i'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than i'm giving it credit for. but i feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because i don't know how.

**tl;dr** i found a torn up plan b box in my trash. the only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. how do i bring this up?",8

after i posted yesterday, i was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. to no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. i picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. i heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but i didn't bring up any of our hardships. my mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. i did, i forgave him but that doesn't mean i need to have a relationship with him anymore. again, my family protested that i'm being cruel and heartless. i'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. i told them i would not be present at any family events if he was there.

my sister shouted at me claiming ""he is our dad. you asshole"". yes he is, to which i replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. i told them i had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. my sisters need to return the iphone's that are on contract as i am cancelling those. driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that i pay for. these are dad's responsibilities now. ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

i have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. i need a break.

i'm done. i'm done taking over dad's role. i'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. i'm 25 and i need to live my own life now. i don't think this will burn bridges. it's just a wake up call for them.

edit: i'm not going to ghost or abandon them. they need to become independent now. 

edit:  i'm reading all the comments. i know i have acted like a jerk. i just need some time to collect my thoughts. i might update later.",8
"update: i am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. i got found out. i post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

since that time i got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until i landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

recently i found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what i used to do, and pays more. basically tired of doing nothing even though im getting paid for it.  

the day after i mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office i got a phone call exactly at 8 am. the head of hr for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. i asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. she stated that there were no issues like that. they just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

i told her that they should have that information as head of hr and promptly disconnected stating i had to return back to work. she called back at 12:05 exactly. 

i have been ducking her calls ever since. her voicemails state that i am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. my emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. each time i am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. she calls at least once per day. 

i am thinking i just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

how incredibly bad is that plan? before anyone says it. i know... i know ok i should have quit a long time ago. i did not.

"(az) our neighbors dog was poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. i say absolutely not. how should we proceed? i guess some background is in order here. earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. we were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. the next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. they did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. the next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. this all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

so they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. we tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

so we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. we have yet to contact the lawyer. 

we had made the initial report to animal control last thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" i was really taken aback and i think i asked ""i think so, do you need some?"" 

he then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. i literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. i explained that i actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and i really have no way of knowing which dog is which). he said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" i got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


the officer then asked if he could take everything. i said i wasn't comfortable with that but i would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. i did exactly this. i was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. again i was taken completely aback and said that i'm not sure what he'd be looking for. he told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. it took me as second but i asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. i asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if i remember) ""not yet."" 
i asked him if i could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. i said i would really rather not but i would get back in touch with him. he gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

i just got home and told my wife. my wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. we have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but i feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

she thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. i say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. i'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. wife thinks we should let them, i say absolutely not.

throwaway account. indian here.

background

mine was an arranged marriage. met my wife for after everything from both families was fixed. got married 2 years back. we are both from bihar. both educated. living in a metro city currently. we got along just fine.

my wife was earlier very reluctant/mechanical in sex. we were having sex for just its sake. slowly, she opened up and it got better in around 5-6 months. no issues there. i always suspected something was off with her. one day something happened after which she got very emotional. i consoled her, and she confided in me that her father used to sexually abuse her since she was in class 8. started with inappropriate touching of private parts, then moved on to full rape while drunk(i didnt ask how many times). her mother knew, but did nothing as he had beaten her before. she just usually pretends to be sleeping/actually sleeping, who knows. she said he does this when gets drunk (they all used to sleep on same bed). she didnt said anything because he said he would discontinue her education and marry her away.

after 12th, she moved to hostel, and when she goes home, in vacations, it happens..inappropriate touchings, handjobs, bjs, and sometimes rape . her marriage was fixed as soon her education got ever. all these things stopped after fixing of marriage. she said thats why she was so hesitant of sex earlier, but after establishing trust, opened up . i wanted to confront him., but she didn't even let me confront him. think about family honour. what would relatives think if it got out.. it happened to me , not you. i dont want it to come out. past is past... all emotional storm.

this all happened 1.5 years back. from then i made a point of never for a single day sending her to her maternal home alone. always with me. we get a separate room to stay there, so no probs thereafter.

now present problem :

we had a baby girl last week, her mother was here to help her through, and as its customary here, after childbirth, her mother wants to take her home, to meet extended family. but i don't want my baby to go even near that man. she is saying im over reacting, nothing gonna happen. okay fine. nothing may happen with my wife now, past is past. but just the thought of that man with my newborn baby girl fills me with rage. i cant let that man even near her. not now, not ever. i dont know if im overreating, i basically told her if she wants, she could go with her mother, i would call my mom, and keep the baby with me here , but wont let my baby near that man. just the thought of him touching my innocent child, i cant handle it. i dont know what im doing, am i being unreasonable, too emotional or what ? what should i do now ?

&#x200b;

**update**

the unequivocal suggestion i got from here was that i should not let her go . i called my parents that night, and told them the whole story. they understood it completely, but also recognized the fact that i can't not allow her to go (family,customs, relations .. the whole shebang.. people will start murmuring). so i have to come up with a different solution. and that was of confrontation. i sat down my mil, and my wife and told both of them that i don't want my daughter in any case to be near her husband. first she tried to act aloof, but i maintained my strictness and told i don't care what happened in the past, you know what your husband did to your daughter, and i will not let him do it to my daughter. period. get it through your head. after i made it clear that if she doesn't even acknowledge the situation, i won't let her go, she broke down, and started cursing my wife for airing the family's dirty laundry to me. i again, strictly, told her to calm down, take the night and think about it. there was a comment here that maybe my wife was lying, no she wasn't. you could just feel the trauma in a person's body, the eyes, the shivering... nobody could fake that.

i went to office next day, talked to my boss and negotiated 1 week leave. that evening, situation at home situation was gloomy as before, but as my mil had actually acknowledged the situation now, she was ready for the compromise. so i made my demands :

1. i only got leave for 1 week only, so i would accompany them to their hometown for 5 days, after that my wife and i would return. not a day more. she would not try to emotionally blackmail my wife to stay longer without me being there. i would get return tickets beforehand.
2. she would make sure every ceremony to be completed in those 5 days alone, whosoever relative wants to visit , do it in that time
3. she would personally make sure my daughter would not go into the hands of my fil, or i would publically make a scene, i won't care who is saying what. i would take my daughter from him and leave. period.

she was reluctant for the 3rd point, but i was adamant. she finally agreed. next day, she went back to her home alone for the preparations of the various ceremonies to be held (initially she want to take my wife and my baby with her, and i was to join them for ceremonies only, that's why this whole drama).

for my wife part, after my mil left, i told her that im concerned about her well being, as it was pointed out in the sub that her defending her father is not normal. it's a coping mechanism. (didn't tell her i posted it online, or used the words like ptsd). she got defensive again. someone has commented about some postpartum stuff. was worried about it too. told her she need therapy. now she got extremely agitated about how it went from just a matter between the two of us to getting therapy. i don't know, maybe she was hormonal. for 2 days she was pissed. and was definitely not ready to talk about it.

well, we had follow ups scheduled with the gynae. i think here i did something of a fuck up. after normal checkups, i told the doc about my wife's trauma, thinking maybe she could convince her. i was told to go out, and they talked for about an hour. i was sitting outside thinking i had fucked up the whole situation. but when i was called inside, my initial instincts were right. the doc had convinced my wife to confront her past, and that these kinds of situations are actually very common, and people dont talk about it (conservative society). she referred her to a psychiatrist she knows, and we would make an appointment with her after getting back from hometown. situation with my wife is tense now. she has agreed for now for therapy, hope she doesn't change her mind. we are going to her mother's house for  5 days, and they will definitely talk. i guess my mil will try to talk my wife out of going to therapy, same airing dirty laundry shit. now i'm thinking it was idiotic of me to take up this therapy issue now, should've waited for coming back from her hometown.

we are leaving this weekend, hope i don't have to face any more drama there. will update if anything happens.

edit 4: finally i'm able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. back down under 1000 left to go now, and it's been a truly interesting experience. i didn't realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, i also didn't expect some of the truly deplorable messages i have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. it's 6:00am gmt here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

"update neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. now she's trying to sue me. we're the ones with 29k in medical bills. nc usa here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=jsce6bw3&sh=7f56780f


my sister and i spent the weekend after i posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
the guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
he is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

the neighbors mean dog has been put down.  she was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

we've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

she was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
one from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  i'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

one for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

her lawsuit against me has a court date of march 5th.  after she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   she then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

she finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in nc where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

now for some extra facts. 

my left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on february 27th. 

our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  the vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  she still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

the destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

the day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  she broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  she straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  she also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

we called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. they asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

the video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  it shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. it also shows her audibly laughing during it. she only started trying to help when i started smashing her dog into the ground. 

we also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the hoa. 

he said it's pointless to go after the hoa and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  our lawyer did tell us that the hoa has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

there was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

i honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

either way, my sister and i both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of march. 

thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. you guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

i'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  please feel free to ask any questions and i'll answer whatever i can.

"calling a girl a ""cunt"" is literally the equivalent of calling a guy a ""dick"" and should be treated as such, but our society treats is as way worse. why the fuck is this a thing? i remember getting kicked out of a frat party freshman year because i was talking about a girl from back home who i thought was a cunt and somebody overheard me. these are both the slang terms for genitalia in both genders, yet somehow calling a girl a cunt is up there with calling a black person the n-word. unfair double standards in my opinion.

hey guys. first of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

so, long story short, 3 days ago i ""broke up"" with her for good.

now, you guys might not agree with the way i did it, but i did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. even though i am sad and disappointed, at the same time i understand she wanted to see other options and i respect she didn't outright cheat on me. that being said, i am also not a backup plan and i deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

i didn't see her anymore and i finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""hey \name\, first of all, i don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. i took some days to think about it and i realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and i would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. i understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. i respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. i wanted to thank you for all those years and i wanted to apologize for any wrongs i did to you. i want you to know that i am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. i hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. goodbye, op""

the message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but i realized i am already getting over it and that i no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. she replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. so, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, i am almost certain that i would accept her back. so yeah, until next time.",8

so i've made a lot of changes in my family life since i posted this a couple weeks ago. i first told everything to my boyfriend. he was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. he also respected that i didn't want her to meet him. 

i decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. she immediately noticed like within ten minutes after i'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so i didn't beat around the bush, i said yes because i didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. she tried to guilt trip me about how i hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like i knew they would). she exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but i hadn't even gotten a chance to say i was worried she'd do this. she said it first so what does that say?

i told her i flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. she called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. i can't reason with her. she just never sees the problem with anything she's done. the way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

i blocked her number, i still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. but we live hours apart, so i figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

then, as for them, i also got a call from my mom soon after i blocked my sister who wanted to know what i was doing because she was upset. she'd already heard my sister's side which was just that i'd blocked her out of nowhere. so i tried to tell her my side. i did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like i said in the first post i'm not going to fall to petty revenge. i just want her to stop interfering in my life. so all i said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys i've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. my mom then wanted to know what i meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). she also got my dad on the call at this point. i told them the details didn't matter. she kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if i had been having premarital sex. it was really frustrating. 

i told them the point i'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. they began saying i should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. well i'm not exactly fighting. i'm simply not going to be in contact with her. to them it's the same thing. 

then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. i said i wasn't going to do that, that i'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. they said they'd come to me then. that brought up how they show up for random visits even when i've said i don't like it. i told them i didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again i wouldn't let them in or talk with them. so they flipped out, that was fun, i got to hear all how i'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

i ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. and blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

i don't know wtf i'm going to do about them. they did threaten to stop paying for my college if i cut them out of my life. i unblocked them to say i want to be in touch with them and do love them but i can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. i said if they stop doing that then i'm happy to have a relationship with them. they had a million reasons why i'm in the wrong. i couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. so i don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

my boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. he thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. he's really helped keep me as sane as i can be. 

overall i just feel really shitty. i wish any of them would ever listen to what i say. but if they won't then what can i do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. it just sucks it has to be so...final, i guess. i wouldn't mind a middle ground like planning a visit with them once in a while, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than i do. 

tl;dr: i'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",8

"by unintentionally giving my friend a masturbation alert so after five months of doing this shit i realized today that this has been happening.

before this happened i was unaware incognito mode on chrome was a thing. because of this every time i would go to a certain nsfw website i would type the link into a discord (basically the new skype) direct message to my friend that lives across the country. i only send the links to him while it said he is offline. i did this so my chrome wouldn't save the keystrokes of whatever website i decided to visit that day and show up in the predictive search. i would then click on the link of the website through discord and delete the message. little did i know that my friend has discord notifications that show up on his phone for whenever he receives a message. he basically had an alert for every time i masturbated.

so after i had been doing this for a while he finally decides to ask me why he receives all of these nsfw links in the middle of the day. i start laughing out of embarrassment because of these notifications he's been receiving. i told him about the whole process i go through just to get to a website. after that he proceeds to laugh for a good few minutes and tell me about incognito mode on chrome as my embarrassment keeps rising. after more laughing we moved on.  

i'm glad to know about incognito mode though i will probably keep doing it has i have been because i'm used to it and it's a great inside joke.   


tl;dr: i have been sending nsfw links to my friend on discord for the past five months while he isn't online to avoid predictive search. he has discord notifications enabled on his phone therefore giving him an alert every time i masturbate .",4

i never changed todds name back. its been a running joke between us for years.
so ""sexy jess from work"" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. she freaks out. comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams ""i hate you dad!"". she runs off upstairs.
so im sitting there really confused. after a few seconds i follow her upstairs. i can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.
now im really confused. i get to the bedroom. my partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from ""sexy jess from work"". i piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.

tldr : buddy saved his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" several years ago as a joke. today my daughter sees it freaks out and thinks im cheating on hwr mother.

"update: i just recieved a demand letter from enterprise rent-a-car stating that if i do not return their rental car, i will be charged with embezzlement and grand theft auto. i never rented a car from them. (san jose, california) thank you to everyone for the advice. i'm also a she by the way (many of you thought i was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

after my initial post, i saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because enterprise is the one at fault and i shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. so i did exactly this, and she told me that id i want her to give me more info, i would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that i am not the person who rented the car.  if not, she would report me for embezzlement and grand theft to the sacramento police. upon hearing this, i decided to file a report immediately online with the san jose police department. i know many of you said i shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, i did not want to take any chances where i could end up with a warrant on my head.  i thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  after filing it, i emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  when i spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that i was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

on may 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. she showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had my information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with cash. (i thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) the manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the sacramento police later that afternoon. the following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as fraud, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  at this point, i was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. i then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to sacramento see who the hell this woman is. however, turns out i didn't have to because 2 hours later...  
  
  
  
the san jose police did show up knocking on my front door. ( 2 policemen and 2 chp officers) before opening it, the first thing i did was grab the copy of the police report i printed because i seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). when i open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if name of woman i do not know lives at my home? i tell them no, and that i have no idea who that is,  then they ask if i am alymg and i tell them that i am. they then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of fremont that morning. the accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. they then show the license to me and it's an exact replica of my drivers license, and i ask them how this is possible if i have my license in my wallet? they then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (the black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) i then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when i hand them my report. i explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from enterprise.  so basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. i told the officers that i have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. i then asked them who is the name of the woman i do not know and they told me that she is the who stole the car. however, i'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we do not look a-like at all. idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. but after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

i do have her name now though, and after doing a google search i found her facebook and other social media accounts. i'm very tempted to message her but i've decided to leave this to the police because i have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she does know where i live) however, i do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

"my college says if i miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes (update) op here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9gdico/my_college_says_if_i_miss_class_to_testify_at_my/?st=jn056nas&sh=90aa7f5f

thanks to everyone's terrific advice, i got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to rainn) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and i were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

one of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching i am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting i was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (i'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

the ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward. 

thank you everyone here who took time to give me such helpful advice. i appreciate all of you! ",2

"by going down a reddit rabbit hole. this didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and i bought a new car. i was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

i came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse reddit while i'm taking care of my business. most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. i can't remember what sub i was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. before i knew it i was reading about ""the donkey show."" yes that one. some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. i wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so i just kept reading.

someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how the donkey show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. midget porn. i thought, ""what the hell, i've never seen this sort of thing before."" so i clicked.

as weird as it sounds, i clicked out of curiosity......i swear. what i saw was exactly what i expected to see. this specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. after a minute or so, i had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub i was in.

i finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. i get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

she was taking a while, so i grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. my wife comes out and gets in the car. immediately she says, ""what the hell is this?"" i put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. on the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". i had never had a car with this feature before, so i was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. i knew i was screwed. it felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so i could change what was displayed on the screen.

after about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks i have a thing for little people. before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. all i could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. i'm pretty sure i'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. yay me...

she said to me one day, ""i know you won't leave me for another woman, but i'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

i doubt she will ever let this one go...

tl;dr i went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.

edit: wow. i think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. my gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought ""haha this reminds me of me and joycemanner!"", saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. all within 20 minutes of making this post! she thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

edit2: to answer some repeated questions: i made this as a throwaway account. the account name is based off a pretty popular band (joyce manor) i like so, i didn't think she would realize it was me. i'm 26 and she's 20. her name is not joyce. i don't think she'll come on here to give her side of the story.

"lpts: chrome extensions i wish i knew of back when i started college. as i am about to enter my grad school i have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. as a result, i recently started exploring chrome extensions, and man i wish i had done this earlier. some will no longer be of use to me but i hope it can help others. 

**cite this for me: web citer**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
this one hurts me a bit as my days with mla, apa, harvard, and chicago are coming to an end. the extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. from my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as easybib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

**google dictionary**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
if you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). it's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. i imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

**grammarly for chrome**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
i often use bad grammar and i know it. this extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. it highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

**readability**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
this extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. i would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article i'd give this a shot. 

**speakit!**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-us)

i know i can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. this app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. or i guess you could take notes as you listen too...

it works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand german-english accents over the default one). you can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. i could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but i would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

**block & focus**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. there are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

**molview**(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

i haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in o-chem or higher. it allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. i was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what i'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.

**bonus tips that i learned**


***make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. it will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***use sleepyti.me(http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** it's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. i cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as i stayed up too late studying. 

***use rainymood(https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** i'm sure many of you know about it but i love this one.

i'm sure i have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. feel free to tell me any i should try out! 

**use f.lux(https://justgetflux.com/) to dim your pc screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep** -credit to kreekybonez for that one!

edit: thanks for the love guys, this blew up way more than i expected! glad to help. wanted to mention a few things after reading through many of your comments.

i hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations. it isn't really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib. **always double check your writing if it is an important paper, especially with citations**. but if you're like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact. just wanted to throw that out there as many redditors have been commenting on those two extensions. otherwise thanks for all the suggestions and upvotes of course!

i wrote them a message trying to make them understand what i was feeling and that it hurt me alot. i got back that i was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. they said they thought i wanted to be ""free"". i know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions i've tried to hide come through. i've never felt this left out and i feel like i'm not a family member. i'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on holliday.
i feel heartbroken.

my plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to uni and dive into school to forget.

how can i forgive them? has this happened to anyone else?

edit: 



i would have paid for myself. this is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. they brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. they are all there. the whole family. they brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. i would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

i am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. i've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that i need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

i'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and i send all the hugs in the world to you! the feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




edit 30 juli: 

i just wanted to say that i've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" i believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. my mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that i wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

for anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. being away from family is hard and i missed mine alot. being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",8
"i was filmed against my consent at a party. (update) last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

history: myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. in a private villa where expected things to be private. a pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. i asked if we have legal options against the person.

we went to the police. myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. they didn't. they said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

it sucked. i didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone i know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

but this didn't end there. this perv didn't stop. he tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. they got him and handed him over to the police. so he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. they took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

he's now locked up. our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

it took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him.

"update tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this. location: toronto, ontario

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant\_is\_renting\_out\_my\_apartment\_on\_airbnb/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

just wanted to thank you all for your support/advice, i was really dumb and naivee when it comes to renting out my apartment. the last time i rented it out the tenant left on time, and i never actually thought about what could happen if they didn't leave.

i have started the process of evicting the tenant today, with support from a local lawyer who is going to handle a bunch of the paperwork for me, and represent me.

my condo board thankfully has been super understanding as soon as i outlined that it was being done without my knowledge, and they have agreed to wave the penalties. apparently there were noise complaints on friday relating to my apartment which annoyed our condo board. our concierge service (we have someone at the front desk 24/7), will no longer be allowing people to leave keys for people at the front desk.

on sunday two people came in to the building asking for keys to my unit, and our concierge  service asked if they were airbnb tenants, and they said yes. he then basically told them to leave right away, and they aren't welcome here.

jane finally got in touch with me today, and basically accused me of numerous things, from harassing her renters, to just in general making her life difficult. she also stated that she will be going to the ltb to ""make a formal complaint because banning airbnb is not allowed"". when i pointed out that as people have told me here that she needs to get  my permission before renting out to other people. she went a rant about how she is doing this for numerous places and how she has never had a problem and ""how stupid i am for making her my enemy"".

i have a ton of proof of what she is doing, honestly my biggest concern is what is going to happen to my apartment. i asked a friend to book my room for one night through airbnb for tomorrow (as it just apparently became available for rent), and take a look at the state of my apartment.",2

"update: i 34m broke up with my 33f girlfriend in the nastiest way possible because of what happened yesterday and today. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9g0n3/i_34m_just_discovered_the_real_side_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

so after i went home yesterday, i cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her.

i called her, she accepted my call and said ""what?"" i told her ""i'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

i texted her, ""i need the copy of my house keys back, i'm breaking up with you.""

she didn't respond. i got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

i looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. so i texted her ""where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

i drove back home and i noticed her car parked next to my house, i carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there i see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my ipad...) that's when i tell her ""what are you doing?"" 

she tells me, ""i'm taking back what's mine."" that's when i tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""get off me."" she started kicking me and ran out the house.

i tell her to give my shit back or i will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so i whip out my phone and dial the cops.

she drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my ipad.

cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and i told them what happened and i tell them the location of her house.

they sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics.

the cops start asking me questions like ""is this the first time?"".....

40 minutes later i got my stuff back.
she has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

now i'm contemplating why life always gives me the shit end of the stick.

"i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom. throwaway, because reasons.

tl;dr: found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. asked girlfriend about it. she started yelling at me and crying and left.

i don't even know where to start with this. i'm dumbfounded. she just stormed out the house and i'm sitting on the bed asking myself a lot of questions.

i live a pretty normal life, and i thought so did my girlfriend. we've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. we started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. she would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. i'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. i always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, i wouldn't stop her.

this is where it takes a turn for the weird. i keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. i also go to the gym frequently, so i always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. i never kept count, but i know by just a visual glance i several pairs. this morning when i went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, i noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. i went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so i checked the washing machine and dryer. both were empty. i couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. so, i did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. after all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. she went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. when i went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. i told her i wasn't mad, i was just looking for my socks. she kinda mumbled ""i'll don't know."" i still wasn't mad, of course, but i was super confused. socks just don't disappear. so i asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""i'll buy you new ones!""

the first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. i thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so i joked with her about ruining my socks. wrong. thing. to. say. she started immediately crying. like, full on sobbing. at this point i don't care about the socks anymore, i want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. i sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. she just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. i tried assuring her again it was okay. even went so far as to say i would buy new socks and she didn't have to. i sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. i told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

on my way out i grabbed the garbage to take outside. when i got outside i lifted the lid off the garbage can and i noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. i could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. since i was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, i wanted to see for myself. i opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. there, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. as soon as the smell hit me i knew it was poop.

1. we don't own any pets.
2. we don't have any kids.
3. whose poop was on my socks?

work could wait. i couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. i grabbed the bag and walked back inside. as soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. she said i shouldn't be going through the garbage and that i was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. i asked her to calm down and that i just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. i wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. that's when it clicked. i don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. i asked her ""is this your poop?"" she started sobbing again and ran out of the house. i didn't go after her this time.

so, now i am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. the only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. i sent her text asking her to come back. she hasn't responded yet. i don't even know what i'm going to say when (if) she gets back.

update:

i had to leave for work and am now at work. yes, i threw away the bag of poopy socks. she texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. she said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to not bring it up in person. i'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as i can. her responses are super short, but i'm getting the idea.

i flat out asked her if it was a fetish. it is not a fetish. she confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. i found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. i had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? she thought i would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. she admitted she has done this for a long time. her reasoning, as best as i can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in any way. she uses socks because it covers her entire hand. after she's done with them, she throws them away. she used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

so, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. it could be worse, i guess. i hope we can laugh about this later. i'm trying to find the humor in it now, but i'm still weirded out.

"for showering my niece? obligatory  ""longtime lurker, first time poster"" disclaimer. also a heads up i personally find this whole situation fucking ridiculous but enough people are mad at me that i feel like i'm losing my goddamn mind trying to figure out what i actually did wrong. 

so last weekend i  25m was watching my niece 3f. i have a daughter 5f myself and she loves when my niece comes over to play as she doesn't have any siblings yet and it's fun for her to have another kid about. on this particular day, the girls were playing outside and decided to make mudpies. okay cool, my kid does that shit a lot. what was *less* cool was when they apparently decided to *become* mudpies. seriously i went inside for like a minute to answer the phone and when i came back they were both head to toe covered in mud and finding it hilarious. i immediately whisked them both inside and threw them in the shower together. i helped them wash their hair, made sure they had a proper wash and then gave my niece some old clothes of my daughters in her size to wear while i washed hers. 

i thought this was the best course of action in the situation - honestly i didn't even think twice about doing it. my sil does not agree. she keeps saying that it's ""weird and creepy"" for me to have showered her daughter as a man who isn't her father and that i should've called her to okay it first. that mindset is kinda confusing to me. like, she's a 3 y/o toddler, she's in a shower with my own 5 y/o kid who i always supervise at bathtime lest my bathroom turn into the lost city of atlantis. plus, what was i supposed to do? let her sit covered in mud til somoene could come get her? however, my brother and both her mother and mine seem to agree that it was at least a bit weird for me to shower her when i'm a man and not her dad. are they right and i'm missing the point or am i right that there's nothing weird about it?

eta: some things that keep cropping up in the comments so i'll address them. 

1. my daughter's mother is dead and i'm single, so no there wasn't a woman about who could've done it instead. 

2. idk if my sil was abused. will throw out there though that i was abused by an older guy at 16 and we had a family friend who wasn't quite abusive but definitely exhibited some creepy behaviours to my siblings and i as kids.

3. i was *not* in the shower with the girls and idk why so many people think i was. i never shower even with my own daughter and certainly wouldn't with anyone else's. 

4. yes they're fine with me taking niece to the toilet and wiping her and that.

5. thanks whoever gave me silver.",3
"by dating my cousin for 5 months you hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing 

i was talking to this guy on hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, i thought he was the one. after exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. we dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn't had time to meet each other's parents. instead of doing the traditional, i'll bring you over to meet my parents, and i'll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. you can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend's mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(uncle's daughter). it took her a second to realize as well. since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn't seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and i moved to the same city. we could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn't right to do. that was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. i told my friends that it didn't work out and silently removed everything from social media..

tldr; dated a boy from hinge for about 5 months, and discovered he was my cousin after our parents informed us while out to dinner

bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

they poop. a lot.

you need to clean their toilets. a lot.

you need at least 2 bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be spayed*)


bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

bunnies are not for picking up! they are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

they need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

you need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

i've been with my fiance now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. my son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and i've gotten to know him really well. however my fiance told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. that if they found out, they would have a complete fit. this really bothered me because i refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. what is going to happen in the future? when my son gets married himself? will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? he's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. when i told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that i was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. i told her that this was unacceptable and that i was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. it's my wedding too and i was his boyfriend there. 

after that i got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. however, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. i do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. i love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. i told my brother and he said that i was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. i still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. would i be the asshole if i did this? am i being unreasonable here?",3

"i (f25) found out my fiance (m27) is with me for money/family business to preface. my family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. thus i am a trustfund baby. i try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
i met my fiance mark when i was 20 and working as a waitress.

we began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

now mark is not poor. he is upper middle class. and while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. i thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. what i want to say is that i never had the impression that mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

in the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and i stood up for him and fought with my dad. they came to love and accept him. when mark graduated dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

sunday i was supossed to work in the evening and i was going to stay with my sister. but i got a fever and was basically just non functioning so i stayed home. instead of staying in our bedroom i made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (i didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so i just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

mark came home when i was fast asleep and i was woken up by loud voices in our garden. i pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark was there with a few friends. just as i wanted to say hello i noticed that they were talking about me.

his friend kept laughing and calling mark ""the man!"". then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and i am free"".

at this moment i felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. i kept hearing them calling me trust fund barbie and stupid and so on. i didn't know what to do so i just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. i texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

i haven't returned home and just told mark that i was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
my sister has been really worried but i just feel so ashamed about everything. my family was right mark is a gold digger and i fell for it. even if i tell my family what happened i have no proof. my father can't fire him just because he is a dick. as far as i know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him i think. i just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

edit : we are non us. mark wasnt talking about anything else. he has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it i helped pay it off. there is no way he wasn't talking about me

edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. i opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. we have called up dad and i will talk to him tommorow. i will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

edit3: some questions have come up.

i don't drive that's why my fiance didn't see my car. i mostly uber arround

i worked as a waitress for the experience not for the money and i don't anylonger

i don't work for my father i am a company shareholder and i have to go to the general quartal meetings but i don't work for him.

i am sure that it wasn't a fever dream. it was arround 38.5c and while it was enough for my body to hurt it wasn't enough to have a vivid dream. by pass out at my sisters o don'team literall medically passing out.

last edit : i am really tired that you guys are defending him saying that it could have been a joke. guess what. it's not fucking funny. you don't degrade and disrespect your partner for laughs. you don't go along calling them stupid, trustfund barbie, stupid bitch and you definitely don't make remarks yourself. i don't understand that macho bravado as many of you have called it, but i don't think that's okay so stop with those comments. it was deeply hurt full.",8

"super awesome update sat down on my friend's macbook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court. i never thought this would turn out the way it did and i really felt like i learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

i went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and i sincerely thank each and every one of you.

i did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so i wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, i'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. she sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

i got served a few days later and went to court. i told the judge i gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current macbook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (i printed out the email i sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. i also told him that when i offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no i want the money in cash. when i told her i'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. i tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

she gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case i guess. after listening to both of us he ruled that i pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. so i'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

if it weren't for you guys i would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and i honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

i feel good for following all the advice here.

"for spiking my leftovers with ghost pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson so my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. after several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. a few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. i wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing i'd eat it the next day. 

since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

i'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. after he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and i get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. i hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",3
"for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper? my sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  i was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. she got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. she said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so i can see how long it takes her if i want to know so badly. so, i did. i got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later i was done. i guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what i did in half an hour.  she once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine i lied about how long it takes because i hate cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

"by asking too much from my gf's mom this actually happened today.

so my gf and her mother haven't spoken much in the last few years. she lives up in ohio and we reside in florida. well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.

the last time she visited, she saw an old wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the wii tennis game. i always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

now to the fuck up.

i thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working wii and wii sports game for the next time she visits.

so i text her: 

me: hey, guess what you can do next time you visit?

her: what's that?

me: bowl me! if you think you stand a chance. >:)

her: excuse me?

me: you heard me, lol.

so 20 minutes or so go by, and my gf calls me, laughing hysterically.

i never said ""bowl me"" oh no dear reddit, i wrote ""blow me""

luckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.

tl;dr: got wii sports for gf's mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of bowl me.",4
"by thinking i had a family history of glaucoma after finding my dad's weed 17 years ago tldr at the bottom

17 years ago i passed my driver's test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. being a huge nerd i checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when i found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. i just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. i handed it to him, said i didn't care who it belonged to but if i ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. he just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, ""it's your mom's for her glaucoma"". whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.

&#x200b;

i was at a family a dinner awhile ago and i can't remember what someone said but i replied with, ""yeah, because mom has glaucoma"" and my mom goes, ""i don't have glaucoma"" and i, incredulously, said ""dad said you had glaucoma"", in which my dad responds to with, ""what the hell are you talking about, i never said that"". after reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe i believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. i told them i had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit i'd been on for the past like 15 years. they just laughed harder.

tldr: i found my parent's weed stash when i was 16, they told me it was for glaucoma, i believed them for almost 2 decades.

"by sending a picture of the engagement ring to my girlfriend tl;dr: accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.

&nbsp;

  so this was actually a few months ago. i (24m) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24f). i was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. 

&nbsp;

  so i put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. welp, it was immediately after clicking send that i noticed the texts in the thread didn't look right. i looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: it was my gf. ""shit"" i said over the phone. my friend asked what was wrong, and i told him i'd have to call him back. tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.

&nbsp;

  as a last ditch effort, i called her, as the message did not yet say ""delivered"". she answered the phone and i immediately said ""do you see the message i just sent?"" ""yeah...it says attachment, why?"" immediately i blurted ""dont open it! just delete the thread. please."" 

&nbsp;

  she sounded concerned, and asked ""is this something i should be worried about? you're kinda scaring me lol"". ""no, no,"" i said, ""i just have a little surprise for you i was trying to show someone and don't want to ruin the surprise."" she relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. ""ok, i deleted it. didn't look at it."" i know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but i can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. the 1 or 2 times i ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. it's just not in her to lie, and she's honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).

&nbsp;

  so i had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now i had her highly suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. so i immediately went and found a cute little necklace on etsy i knew she'd like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. later that week she got it and texted me, saying i was very sweet and she loved my surprise. phew. a few weeks later i actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected i was going to propose. despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her ""girls' day"" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.

&nbsp;

  when i told her about what that text really was and how i covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. she was impressed with how i improvised and threw her off track lol. we're getting married next october :)

"for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiance that i cheated 9 years ago? for reference, my brother connor is 19, i am 26, and my (now ex) fiance hunter is 28. also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. hunter and i were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when connor asked if we wanted to join them. i initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

we all got pretty drunk and connor had the idea of playing never have i ever. a few rounds in, the statement ""never have i ever cheated before"" came up.

now's a good time to mention that hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. his ex-fiance cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. and unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, i cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. it was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. this was almost a decade ago, i obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

well my brother knows about this so when i didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? you know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). you have to drink to that!""

my boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. i followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. i'm numb. i'm heartbroken. he was my everything and more and i still don't know how i'm going to move on.

connor tried to apologize, but i feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. this morning i served him an eviction notice. he begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. i just can't look at him right now. he ruined my life. after i raised him and cared for him like he was my own. i feel so hurt. am i being unreasonable?",3

i went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. she took one look at the letter from my friend aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

she contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if i heard more otherwise no need for more action.

aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. he wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. i hadn't complained to them myself so i did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

"i (23f) genuinely think that there's someone living in my attic. i'm not sure this is the right place to post but it made the most sense to me. i have reasonable suspicion that someone is squatting in my attic or accessing it on a regular basis. 

to note. the house hadn't been lived in for about 4 months prior. and is in an okay area of cleveland, oh. 

i've been moved in for about a month and a half - i've heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then i've just chucked it up to being new house sounds. i'll be honest and say i've been too scared to see if anything's up there since i've moved in so i've never even seen the attic. today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so i asked him to check it out. he popped up with a flashlight and there's a tent set up. he came down and told me. my sister and i came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. the back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. we called the cops and waited about ten minutes. once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. cops didn't do anything and didn't even go up to check. they were neato. so i put my head up to check while they were there. it's a tent. there's playing cards. they took my name and left. 

sooo i nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. i was thinking first thing i should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

other than that - do i hire someone to check the house? do i call the cops again another day?  
should i not stay here alone?

"by letting my niece and nephew use my psn account, and ruining my girlfriend's holiday. update post here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu\_update\_letting\_my\_nephew\_use\_my\_fortnite/(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu_update_letting_my_nephew_use_my_fortnite/)   


maybe you already know where this is going.

my niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. they're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. my niece (who we'll call l), and my nephew (who we'll call w) don't have many games on their psn account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle i am, i game them access to my psn account, to play my far superior collection of games.all was well for about a month. i knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.

but imagine my surprise yesterday when i get this message on facebook...

&#x200b;

""a\_sad\_frog, can you check your bank? ""

it was my brother in law. l and w's father.

""w is playing fortnite and he has 65,000 v bucks, is this normal?""

&#x200b;

my heart stopped. their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.i went to my transaction history on psn, and nearly threw up when i saw this(https://imgur.com/a/qzu4scn)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**

&#x200b;

all told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. by the time i got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. i saw that the playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. that's **fu number 1.**""tell them to stop what they're doing. shut off your ps4. i have to sort this out"".

&#x200b;

i immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **nothing**. playstation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. this is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherf\*ng v bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. for all intents and purposes, i have lost that money. the bank can't do anything about it.

so here's where it gets really messed up. **fu number 2**. my girlfriend is visiting family in the us, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. she will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. that was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than i ever could have expected, and far better than i deserved.

i'm not mad at the kids. i genuinely don't think they meant it. i'm mad at myself. i didn't think it was possible, but then i should have done more research. i feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just f'ed. we're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.

"schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing. you have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. so many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. i had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and i had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until i cried so i was forced to give up, not to mention that was a huge expense every month some families might not be able to spare. different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. turns out i didn't even have acne. i have a very common condition called kp, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. if you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. i could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. these kids essentially have an addiction. the majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine bmi and extremely healthy. not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

i knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

all in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. i'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? it is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? we often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

"for telling my gf's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay? me and diomara (12f) have had a rough summer.  she's been more defiant than usual.  i've been dating her mom mara (30f) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, maple (33m).  both dio and mara have an on again/off again relationship with dio's dad (dynasis).  he's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into dio's life.   typical shitty-ass part time dad.  i've tried to fill the dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200b;

this summer dynasis decides he wants to be a real dad and takes dio in for a month.  good for him, not my business, and mara agrees.  when dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  really mean to me, very dismissive.  a few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  security took her in then called mara, who didn't answer, then called dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  i answered.  they told me i had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200b;

i didn't say anything to her while i picked her up.  i apologized to security, apologized to the store.  i even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  i assured them dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200b;

i'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  not yelling, but in a fatherly tone, i suppose.  i'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how i dont fuck with thieves, and how i absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so i don't appreciate any of this nor will i accept it in my house.  she snaps back that i'm not her dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  from now on, if i wanna tell her something i need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200b;

that killed my soul.  for the past year or so, i've treated her as my own daughter.  i've paid for their housing, i've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  her bio dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  the fuckin check bounced so i had to call him up and he brought cash over.  i told mara about all of this.  she was appalled at what dio said, but she never made dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her dad.""

&#x200b;

a couple of days later dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  i say go ask your dad.  she scoffs and says her dad doesn't have the money for it, so i have to pay for it.  i tell her...i'm not her dad so don't ever tell me what i have to pay for.  she cried to mara, who tells me i'm not being an adult about the situation.  mind you, i never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  mara says dio is a kid and i need to stop acting like a kid too.",3
"if your child is fat it's your fault and you're a bad parent. obviously there's a handful of medical conditions that are exceptions, but if your child is otherwise healthy, it's your fault. 

you are their caretaker, you control most of what they eat, and you control their physical activity to a great extent. 

if your child gets to the point where their weight starts to cause health problems you should be charged with child abuse and have your child taken away.

you're letting them learn eating habits that are going to cause them to likely be fat their entire life, putting them at a higher risk for a long list of serious health issues. 

edit: i'm gonna try and address some reoccurring comments here. 

i understand that (at least in the states) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. for the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


and on taking kids away from parents i agree there should be some steps before that happens. there should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. but if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.

i get there and pick a table. after waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. that's very strange so i assume she must be after something. free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, i don't know.

so i explain to her that i'm actually waiting for someone and i don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

that's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one i'm waiting for. she told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

and she was also testing me to see if i would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. so here's the thing, i don't know how i feel about being ""tested"". i don't want to live my life questioning every decision i make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

"if your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriend/s, you should break up with her. for the record, i'm not talking about things she tried once with an ex, but never did again because she genuinely didn't like it (although, an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once, too).

what i am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. she had no negative feelings about it).

&#x200b;

there are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200b;

the first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. he is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. i know, crazy right?

&#x200b;

the second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. you are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&#x200b;

now, reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200b;

1. no guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. i'm not saying that a guy should say ""do this for me, or i'm leaving."" i'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. that relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. this obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, i only picked men and sex because i tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. if both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then i guess it's a match made in heaven.

&#x200b;

this post was inspired by myself and a group of guys talking about our past relationships and the commonalities we noticed with each other.

for me, it was a girl in high school who refused to kiss me (we did everything else but no kissing), but admitted to me that she'd kissed her ex a lot. i dumped her. girls i've been with since haven't held back like that (at least not that i was aware of.)

another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

another guy wasn't getting blowjobs, but found out from a mutual friend that his girlfriend loved giving them to an ex.

there are more, but they're all pretty much the same story.",6
"if someone doesn't understand something you're explaining to them, treat it as your fault for failing to explain effectively, not their fault for not understanding. i've recently realized this is the root of most of the communication issues with my friends and family. i would try to explain something, for example: how to run the new dishwasher. if they failed to understand the process, i would get angry (not at them, just in general) and they would see it as a critique of their intelligence. the discussion would quickly turn into an argument and in the end everyone would just hate the new dishwasher. 

so i started acting like it was my failure to explain the situation...even if it wasn't. it totally changed the tone of my voice and made the person i was talking to more receptive to my instructions. instead of turning into an argument or debate, it turns into a constructive teaching opportunity.

"for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it. for the last year i've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


about a week ago i went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if i wanted a receipt. at this point i figured i had just used a deal i don't know about, but the next time i went the same thing happened. so the next several times i've gone i've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


i'm thinking something is wrong and i should tell someone, but i kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. aita?

update: hi guys

i thought i had the golden ticket, i really did. 

i thought i had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. the rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. last night i dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


i wanted to ask you fine people if i was the asshole real quick before i went balls deep and pilfered my way through a midwest convenience store chain. i'll be honest i didn't care what people said though. i was high on the fact that i had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


after i made the post i made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""i mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


i made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause i was sleepy. and then i went to perform the maneuver. i strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

it was a gift card. 


i had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, i found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

i'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" but i sucked it up and paid, and now all i have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

"meta you can still be the asshole if you were wronged i've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, i've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. op was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? and there is a resounding chorus of nta! you don't owe anyone anything! or someone was mean to op, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. aita?  no! they were rude so you get to be as well! 

i dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. these reactions are understandable. but just because its understandable doesn't mean op can't be the asshole.

"alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn't have the social acceptance it does. alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven't done many drugs. it slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. in high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance i've ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

there is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don't seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

i really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify i don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly.

last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. while we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. my brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what i know it's one of his biggest hobbies. well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

i was furious and took it from him. here is the problem though, after i confirmed with my brother it was his i found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. so my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. i told him i would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up.

honestly, what are my options here? i can't afford to pay him back right now. if he does go the police will my son get arrested? he's only 15. it was very wrong of him to do but i think my brother is over reacting. what can i expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",2

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men it's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. but every woman i have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. and a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

and if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. if men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. but most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. its ludicrous.

tl;dr: women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. this is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. sorry this was so long.

edit: okay obviously i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so i would like to clarify some things. 

1. this thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. i have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. people who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. i am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. but there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. people refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, i think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have a lot to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. it starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",6
"update coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex's dog euthanized. can i help prevent this? link to first post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

glad to say i've got a happy update!

the coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). i wasn't working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

the ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. he's also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. the dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn't shown any human or dog aggression. 

police and animal control are very good around here. they assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they'd require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can't be ""bitten"" by the dog without violating it. and the department says they don't allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog's owner but not the police/animal control. 

so the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. i'd call it a win!

thank you all for your advice and support!",2

"for making an obese man pay me cash to take up part of my seat on a long flight? so this month i was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which i had booked and seats selected for. i specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

well, a very obese man boards and i can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. i assume maybe he bought two hence why he's even attempting to board. i'm mentally crossing my fingers he's not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

i get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. i sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. after a minute, i decided to be upfront and tell him:

""sir, i'm sorry but this situation is not working for me, you're taking up quite a bit of my seat"". 

he wasn't rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there's not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. it just wasn't enough, though. he still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. i'm talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

i end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. she instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. she goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren't any open seats on this flight, so there wasn't a way to move people so he could have two. this causes a very awkward silence. 

the guy seemed embarrassed and didn't want to get up. he mentioned how he can't wait for a later flight. i felt bad for him but i was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort i paid for. the flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he'll need to book another flight. the guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here's where i made my offer. 

i told the guy, ""look, i'll put up with this if you give me $150 — that's half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.""

he instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. he even told me he appreciated it. 

well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn't volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. i just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

from my perspective, i gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and i was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person's body pressed against you involuntarily). a win-win. he wasn't angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. 

after the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but i ignored them. this leads me to beg the question, aita? ",3

the next day i was scrolling through facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth.

"by taking a picture of my wife's ass this happened about a week ago.

&#x200b;

i  took my wife to barns & noble to get some new books for us to read.  i was half halfheartedly looking at different books while trailing my wife throughout the store. at some point i realize my wife is nowhere to be  seen, but whatever i'll find her eventually.

&#x200b;

after  a few minutes of mindless wandering, i notice her on the other side of  the store. i also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as i'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, i hear someone behind me shout ""hey creep! why are you  taking a picture of that girls ass!?"" i turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

i  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. my wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that i had to leave. she explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&#x200b;

the employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. honestly i'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. it was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

&#x200b;

tl;dri took a picture of my wife's ass, an employee called me out for it, not knowing it was my wife. my wife left me high and dry until the manager asked me to leave. everyone we know, now refers to me as ""the ass-man"" now.  

and before anyone starts polishing their armor, yes, my wife knows i do this. yes, my wife is more than okay with it. she does the same thing to me.

&#x200b;

edit: just to clarify, my wife already had the picture in hand when she went up to confirm to the manager we were indeed married. the manager never doubted her affirmation that we were indeed married. i'm pretty sure she just wanted to show off her wedding dress again.

"i 17/m glanced over my shoulder at my girlfriend 17/f going though all her messages, and i saw hearts and ""i love you"" to her best guy friend. is it normal, or am i just overanalyzing things. she text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. here's the kicker though. he calls her cutie. he's told me in person that he's interested in her. he calls her cutie over text. now, obviously i can't just outright tell her anything, because then she'll know i caught a glance. she said i love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so i guess it's normal. i'm just trying to get some other opinions.

edit one: wow, thanks everyone, seriously. i talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. she was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. i told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. she agreed with me, i think. i told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole ""i love you"" thing. she has some extracurriculars, so i won't hear from her until around 4:45. thanks everyone, so much. i'll let you all know what went down.

edit two: nothing yet from her, but i'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. if i don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong.

edit three: so, being 17, i have a momma to talk to. so, that's exactly what i did. i went driving with her, i've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and i both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. however, come monday, i will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. obviously, i won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. thank you all for the continual support, i love you all.

edit four: alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. he called me, and apologized. he didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. he said ""it may have been bad"", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that. the girl is feeling much better now, so all things considered, we have come out of this stronger than we were going into it. thank you all, even the ""you're 17 shut up fag"" comments. i love you all unconditionally. night y'all.",8
"minor daughter refuses abortion. tw: sex, minor

throwaway for obvious reasons. i'm still shook and my boyfriend and i have been freaking out since we found out. i'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

our daughter is 11 years old. we found out she was pregnant. she had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. we never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

it was clear she had a crush on him, but i never thought anything of it. until she started complaining about things, i'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when i had been pregnant. 

i didn't jump to the conclusion, but i did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

they'd been having sex. god knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. i won't go in to details. because i never wanted to imagine them myself. 

we had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. my boyfriend was fuming after i told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

they knew as much as we did of the whole thing. they were as shocked as we were. we've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

but she keeps saying she wants a baby. and i just don't fucking know what to do. i tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  i was trying to be level headed. but she didn't seem to understand at all. we've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

what can i do? is the boy, or his parents liable? what can a doctor do? can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?

edit: sorry for all the edits but i think i need to clarify something. the reason my roommate isn't paying rent is cause her parents hit a tough spot financially last winter, and my dad wanted to ease the burden on them a little. he said he would help out by giving my roommate a place to stay so her parents could just worry about her tuition and not room/board.

"by losing my right testicle in a ball slapping contest obligatory ""didn't happen today"" but four years ago when i was 17.

also no need for a throwaway account since pretty much everyone i know have heard the story.

&#x200b;

my friend and i were in the sauna and he gets an idea that we should see which one of us could make our balls clap louder by hip thrusting back and forth and i was like ""yeah haha let's do that!"" so there we were, two straight dudes standing in the sauna hip thrusting away and laughing at the sound our sacks made. my friend won the contest and we sat down. i started to feel a little uncomfortable. like someone was squeezing my right nut. it didn't hurt that much when i was sitting down but once i got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. my vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ° c sauna). i dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. my friend brought me a glass of water and i chugged it down in one go. i told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. he asked me if i preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, i said i'll have both. i chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually i require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. i laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level i told him that i'm going to head home. i had ridden my moped there so i had to ride it home as well. it was winter and the roads were bumpy. each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but i managed to get home. once i got home i walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. usually i stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why i went to sleep so early. she was worried that i had been drinking or taken drugs so i just told her that i almost fainted and want to sleep now. in the morning when i woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so i rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. she examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. when i got home from school i showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. there they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. we waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that i had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. a nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. i changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. i was put to sleep and when i woke up in the recovery ward i immediately sat up. a nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. they tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. i started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). the nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. they were shocked about my condition and asked me how i was feeling ""as a man"" but i told them that i just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest.

"john lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life. he was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  lennon resented his son julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. after lennon divorced his wife, he took off with yoko ono and dropped out of his son's life for years. julian has stated that paul mccartney was far more of a father to him than john ever was. 

john was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. he often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. he claimed to have met yoko ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

john claimed to have lost interest in the beatles due to paul mccartney's tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. together, he and yoko  destroyed the beatles, then he blamed the breakup on paul mccartney. 

he was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the black panthers.

he was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
his song writing was no better;  the lyrics to strawberry fields forever and come together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

so after one of the most stressful months of my life, i can happily tell you all that i got custody of my step sister.

i did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people i've ever met in my life. i told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

after my step sisters bio dad was informed that i would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. the lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. she said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

after her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, i then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. i've never signed so many things in my entire life. because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, i was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

yesterday, i signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that i had 100% custody of my step sister. after i signed, we both cried and cried for hours. we're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. as i write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

the past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. i consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision i've ever made. these events have made me realise that family isn't just dna based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. i owe all of you for the rest of your lives. once i turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

i hope you all lead wonderful lives. give your loved ones a big hug for me.",2
"by giving my 19 year old puggle the fat off my t-bone steak this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. 

on mobile so forgive me for my sins. 

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he's been my best friend my whole life cause i'm 22. so he's all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, i was cleaning my t-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. i thought, ""man, buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so i proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. i proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (quickly for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so i didn't expect this, but i suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. i'm watching him eat it cause i'm all stoked he's enjoying himself & feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk irishman.   i instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so i grab the fucker & tug it out. he's unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. i'm freaking the fuck out. so i start giving him cpr. (i don't know how to do cpr for humans, let alone a dog, but i gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day i die. he lays there for a second & i rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug i gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat i ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. i monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. i gave him some love & he went to sleep. 

my life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us. 

tl;dr i brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat.

edit; wow, thank you for the silver, kind stranger ;-;

edit; this post blew up. thank you so much for all the love, very pleased to know so many enjoyed.

edit; everyone loves buster so much, i've created an instagram for him that i will be posting on regularly. link is in the comments cause idk if my p9st will get taken down if posted on main post. you wanted da cult? you got da cult. many more posts to come.",4

"microwaving leftovers or a frozen meal? turn the power down and the timer up. 10mins at half power does a better job than 3 minutes on full throttle. food comes out looking like food!!! seriously, microwaves only do a shit job if you're impatient. dial the power back, cook it for longer, and go choose your show on netflix or whatevs while it cooks - you know you're just gonna let it go cold while you choose a show anyway, so get on top of your shit, flip it and reverse it, choose the show first and enjoy your hot leftovers rather than choking down a cold soggy mess.

for example: a lean cuisine green curry & rice says on the box ""cook on high for 3 minutes let stand and serve"" - but it only says that because they know you're an impatient little shit and won't buy the box that says ""cook on 1/4 power for 12 minutes"" because if you're not going to cook your own calorie controlled curry, you're also not going to stand around waiting *twelve whole minutes* for this one when the *other* brand says it's done in three.


edit because you people never stop posting the same 'such time yuck microwave 20 mins in oven instead am smart' comment a million times over:

i'm a chef. you all have high hopes for how quickly your oven pre heats, and how easily you can remove a frozen meal from plastic tupperware to change into an oven safe dish. you all also seem to be the type of person who would blast their shit in the microwave anyway, because s frozen curry being cooked through in the oven in 20 mins from turning the oven on would mean using a blast furnace. also, did the title say ""if you're choosing how to reheat something...?"" no. it doesn't. because i'm specifically addressing **microwave** usage, so outta here with your faux superiority, go make your own thread about ovens and toaster ovens and airfryers. not everyone has those things - dorm students may have a cooktop and convection microwave. i certainly don't have space for a toaster oven to sit around on my bench like a jerk all day (that's what the microwave is for). 

also for those asking about fries: skip the microwave and go straight to the sandwich press. you're welcome. ",9
"a wife was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband's key in the door. ""stay where you are,"" she said. ""he's so drunk he won't even notice you're in bed with me."" the husband lurched into bed, but a few minutes later, through a drunken haze, he saw six feet sticking out at the end of the bed.

he turned to his wife: ""hey, there are six feet in this bed. there should only be four. what's going on?""

""you're so drunk you miscounted,"" said the wife. get out of bed and try again. you can see better from over there.

the husband climbed out of bed and counted. one, two, three, four. damn, you're right.",0
"by changing a client's desktop background to sexy pikachu this just happened 2 hours ago.


i work for an it company that services many small/medium businesses. i'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. we like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


i had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his pc unlocked. i sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. i quickly pulled up ie and googled ""sexy pikachu"". found the one(http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. then i went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. standard stuff.


i quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. he notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. then he says, ""hey, i'm remoted into a client's computer. you changed their background, not mine.""


i shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""hey, i have jane doe on the phone. she says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" jane doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. i also believe she's the owner's daughter. at first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. he's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


i stand there for a good 30 seconds before i say ""ok, send her over to me."" i'm a director and i have a working relationship with jane doe, so it's really best i talk to her.


i answer the phone. i listen to what she has to say. she had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. she attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new pc and she wants to know what's going on. i tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. i apologize for it, i tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. i hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  i've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""hey, i'm locking my computer for you"" or ""hey, i'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""


tl;dr tried to change coworker's desktop background to sexy pikachu, accidentally changed it on a client's pc he was connected to instead. main point of contact for that client saw the background and immediately called in wanting to talk to a manager. am manager.",4
"by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage. this came to a head on sunday night. i've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. she would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. this was fine for a few weeks. then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. i dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. that this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. i wouldnt know.

my mind jumps to affair. the love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. i figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. i basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. she declined, said maybe when she gets back. like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. so i follow her. there is a dennys down the road from our house. she gets out and goes in. im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. i go inside and i cant find her. nowhere to be seen. its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. she finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""how can you do this to me!"" the fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. my wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""you're caught, where is the guy?."" ""what?"" ""dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""there isnt a guy."" ""why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" at this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. in the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""i had to use the bathroom."" uncontrolled sobbing. ""what....you had to what?"" ""i had to go to the bathroom."" ""we have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""i dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""a dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. i just never noticed, never second guessed it. she stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. so many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. her  shame was brought down by bananas. i could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. so, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

tl;dr my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

edit. thank you to whomever decided to award my idiocy and my wifes shame with gold.

edit 2. for the people asking for proof of my wife pooping.....what the hell is wrong with you. you are devin to me now.

final edit. this was posted this afternoon, at 9:31 pm, after reading the comments she asked me to play video games, announced she was going to go buy bananas and turned on every faucet we have while locking herself in the bathroom.",4
"update: fiance may die, sister wants half of our house if he passes. i apologize for formatting/grammar errors. i am on my phone.

my post got a decent amount of attention. i thought i would update since i still get really sweet messages from people wishing me well/praying for me and my family. 

my fiance, now husband did pull through! he's currently in our backyard setting up a tent to ""camp out"" with our 2 and 3 year old boys. he was in a coma for over a month and the doctor's were pretty sure he would never wake up. his recovery was slow and he still goes to physical therapy 4 times a week but he is pretty much back to normal now and we couldn't be happier! although it was a horrible thing to go through it changed both of us for the better. you don't realize how much the small things matter until they're about to be taken from you. 


he was appalled by his sisters actions when i finally discussed it with him. we recently both made wills and made sure there is no chance sil or bil will get any money if both of us were to pass, or god forbid our children too. we also chose godparents for our children and we are expecting a baby girl in 2018! 

i really appreciate all of the sweet thoughtful messages i was sent. they definitely made me feel better on bad days to know how many people were praying for him! ",2
"for dressing nicer than the couple getting married? a few months ago, my brother and now sil announced their intention to marry. the invitation to the wedding stated ""no dress code. wear whatever is comfortable for you."" in hindsight, i think they put that there since the event was at a lake. i didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, i should dress respectably for such an occasion, and i have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. i chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

yesterday was the wedding. when i showed up, i noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than i was. i'm talking polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. i did feel a little out of place. my brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my sil was wearing a modest white dress. the only comment i got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying i looked like i'm marrying the sil, but that was it.

a few hours ago, i got a call from sil. holy shit, she is pissed at me! she was asking why i dressed like a pimp, i upstaged her and my brother, and i stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. i referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and i was dressing respectfully. she was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. i told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. she asked if i was that retarded. i told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. i hung up. she spammed my phone with calls, so i blocked her and texted my brother i'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

was i in the wrong?

edit: clarified she said i stuck out on the photos.

edit 2: my brother said i'm welcome to come over for dinner later. i unblocked her number. no call spam, so that's a good sign.

edit 3: had dinner with my brother and sil earlier. she showed me the pictures, and i can kind of see what she was talking about. i told her i'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because i did notice i was out of place and i should have tried to do something. she said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. so yeah, i don't think we're gonna be on jerry springer as far as i can tell.",3
"buying my son's halloween candy away from him my kids go trick or treating. we live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

when they're young we tell them santa brings every boy and girl a present on halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he'd leave in exchange. 

when the kids get old enough to realize santa is a hoax, that's when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

did this with our oldest two and it worked great. they'd give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the santa thing. we explained the new deal. 

he said ""so then it's my money and i can buy *whatever* i want with it? a new skateboard even? *anything*?"" ""you bet."" ""swear?"" ""yep."" 

he goes and brings us **all** his candy. even every kit kat, his favorite. i was shocked, but he'd been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must've decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 i'd spent all week. 

next day i brought the candy to work. then we went to walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. we met at the check out. 

there's my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred kit kats for $10.00. 

i started to tell him to put it back, but he said ""what? you said i could buy *whatever* i wanted! you swore! i want my candy back then."" 

his candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. and i did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

so... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

i don't know who's more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this. 

*tl;dr i bought my son's halloween candy back from him to get the sugar out of the house. he spent the money on twice as much candy as he had gotten trick or treating.*

"don't be a dick to people who bought their dogs. what is with the toxic ""adopt don't shop"" community. there is no reason to treat someone like king asshole for buying a dog. lots of people have a reason. for example i would love to adopt a dog. all my other pets are adopted. however i can only tolerate being around certain dog breeds due to allergies so my family had to buy a dog. it's better to buy a dog, then to adopt one and have to give him back to the shelter due to allergies.

note: the dog i bought isn't a pure breed. i meet his owners, parents, saw their set up, vet records, etc.

"by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp technically yesterday and not today, but yifu sounds like some odd anime genre so...

so it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. i was dropping her off at about 8ish and i was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. for the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

anyway, stopped at the summer camp. my daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. i signed my daughter in and then i.... just drove off. in my defense, well, i got nothing. honestly, i just forgot the dog there.

so my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. i now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). she also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. she got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. all in all, could have gone worse.

edit - i get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  sorry, but no can do.  pics include other people's kids and i'm not going to post that.  also, i think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and i've said way too much shit i regret on reddit for that to happen.  just use your imaginations.  she's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  she's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

edit 2 - for those asking.  yes, camp called me.  twice.  and left vm's both times.  number was not one i recognized so i didn't pick up or check vm (i know, tifu!  number is now programmed in).  both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if i could come pick the dog up.  i clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  and yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  huge huge props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

edit 3 - for those asking.  i did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  so i left them an awesome review on yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

edit 4 - yah, i get it.  this could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  yes, it was a mistake on my side.  that's why i'm posting it here and not on r/todayiwasawesome

edit 5 - holy crap.  came back to see this hit the front page and my inbox has 500 messages.  i just want to take a moment and say thank you to my mom and dad for having sex with each other and making this moment possible.  

tl;dr - dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. dog had a great time and i think she's now a camp counselor.",4

"by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral this happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time, and i was having a pretty bad day, i was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. if youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so i do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....then i here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so i wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so i pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, i take down his number so i can repay him later on. at this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months. my auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon.
my son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

tl;dr got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and i somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

"serious my (35m) girlfriend (24f) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and i'm not into it at all. so, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. an additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like 'f*** me with that horse cock'. i've never thought much of it, i thought that was just a way of her saying it's big. but she's started to take it further and it's turned into a bit of a fetish that i'm not entirely comfortable with. a few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first i was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. i laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. i said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said i'd do it the following day. honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. i told her no, and i didn't want to do it again and she's back to being mad at me. am i being a dick here? i don't know what to do. sorry if wrong sub, just wanted a second opinion",8
"coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if i don't have sex with him. so a guy i know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. i thought i had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but i guess he somehow found the video. we work in the finance industry and i do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. the guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

this is also because i went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

so, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, i'll just call myself h, he found revenge porn of me online. at first i was relieved that it was him cause i've known him for so many years and thought i could trust him. then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. horrified i push him away. he then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if i come over to his place and have sex with him. other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

we're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. that day i just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

he's told me that i should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

i feel so betrayed, since i thought we were good friends. and i'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. i've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

if anyone else has dealt with this, how did you deal with a situation like this?

tl;dr- coworker found revenge porn of me online. he's been sexually harassing me and is threatening to share it if i don't have sex with him.

edit- many people are telling me to go to the police. it's sadly not as simple as going to the police for me. he is from a very wealthy family that practically owns the company. he's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone i know if i don't have sex with him. 
also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. i'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

"for telling my new neighbours that i've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends? i've been away since thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently sunday afternoon where i live.  here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that monday to friday, which means i had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. 

my 30 something year old neighbours moved in on friday when i wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when i was collecting my mail. she goes ""don't check your mailbox on weekends. they don't deliver on weekends. so don't check it."" (in a rude karen voice, if you know then you know.) already, i know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and i'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so i said ""i know, it's just i've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so i had to check the mailbox."" i don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

she seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. then we both went inside and that was that. about 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking i was held captive in my basement which i don't have, so i explained to them what i had said and they just laughed and left.

just before, i was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think i was kidnapped

"update overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

so i read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, i was doubting if i made the right decesion. i wasn't going to update because i didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days i came to a final conclusion.i want to clarify that i broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

after i broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. she would send me letters and call me a lot. in one of the texts i actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. i was about to agree, but something she said made me realize i would be making a mistake if i did. she said, ""i'll remember to respect from now on."" that sentence made me realize that i made the right choice by breaking up. since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

either way i'm glad i didn't give her a second chance. i don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

on a sidenote, the other day i was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and i guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that i moved on to fast. blocked her and had a laugh i know for a fact i made the right choice.",8
"i'm being sued by the at fault driver who doesn't know i have dash cam footage hello, 

i got hit in brampton, ontario in october 2018. 

i'll try to keep it short! last october a driver ran a red light while she was making a left hand turn  (in a 2 lane left turning street) and hit me as i started going through the green. 

i called 911 but no one came because no one was injured so we got towed to the police station and made reports. no one got charged with anything, even though she should have imo. they didn't ask questions or care. no ambulance came, no major injuries. 

the insurance was easy, 100% not at fault for me, all her fault (as i was told is the case for 99% of these types of accidents, where one driver turning left hits a driving going straight). no issues what so ever, they paid off my car and that's it i moved on. 

fast forward about 5 months and i received mail that i believe was sent to my insurance company requesting a bunch of information and that she intends to take legal action against me for what i believe is lost wages, guess she got hurt. 

her police report is attached which includes what she says happened. it doesn't make any sense as she wrote ""he had the green and got hit by me making the turn on a yellow light"" 

the funny thing is, i don't think she knows a driver that was in the inside turning lane beside her stopped and gave me the dash cam footage he had. this footage shows he and the car in-front of him stopping for the red, and you can clearly see her car coming into frame in the outside turning lane on his right after the light is already red, she flies through the red and hits me as i'm moving forward at the green. all very clear on the footage. 

my question is, how can she sue if she's at fault? i'm sure i'll win a case with the footage i have, but what is the likelihood she will have to pay my legal fees? that's what i'm most worried about. 

any thoughts on this situation is helpful.

"update 1 year later- i 28f gave my boyfriend 28m an engagement ultimatum and i might be regretting it original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

tl;dr: my boyfriend and i have been together for 4.5 years, moved to a new city together, and live together, but i had not been able to get him to have a serious discussion about where the relationship is going/whether he sees us getting married (i've known that i want to marry him for about 2 years, so i've been trying to bring up the topic for about that long). i was getting frustrated, (i would like to have kids, and my time to do so is limited) so i told him in september that we needed to be engaged by 3/31/18 (when our lease expired) or i was going to move out.

&#x200b;

update #1 here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/861lrl/update\_i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/861lrl/update_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

tl;dr: written 10 days prior to the ultimatum deadline, my boyfriend said he wasn't planning to propose. his asked me to stay with him and assured me that he would propose in december 2018 if i visited his family in their home in september and he spoke with them about his plan to propose to me. his reasoning was that i had to visit his family in their home before he felt comfortable taking the next step (i had spent time with his parents in the past, so this didn't make sense to me). i was frustrated but planning to stick to my guns.

&#x200b;

now, on to the current update:

***march 2018***: i couldn't go through with the ultimatum. i was planning to move out, actually found a new apartment, and wrote the check for the deposit. but when push came to shove, i couldn't picture my life without my boyfriend. i decided that i loved him too much to leave him over the arbitrary deadline that i had created. i also believed that he meant what he said about getting engaged in december. i felt i was being silly for leaving him after 4.5 years because i wouldn't wait another few months. as a compromise, he said we could get a cat (i had been wanting one but he'd been saying no), and he said he'd go to at least one family event with me this year. on 3/31, the day i was planning to move out, we got a cat together.

&#x200b;

***april-september 2018***: my boyfriend and i spent time enjoying each other without really mentioning the ultimatum. we both needed to recover from the damage it did to our relationship. i got a therapist and started working on myself. i picked up a new hobby (running), developed new friendships, and spent a lot of time working on my career and hanging out with my amazing new cat. i think focusing on myself/my career/my friendships took some of the pressure off of him. also, multiple family events came and went, and my boyfriend had an excuse not to attend each one. i'm not sure it was that big of a deal anyway. by the end of the summer, we were doing great and it was like the ultimatum never happened. he also complaints about our cat constantly.

&#x200b;

***september 2018- visiting his family***: as i promised him, i went to visit his parents in their home in september. as i mentioned in the previous post, he is chinese-american (and i'm white), so i studied up on my basic chinese and was able to speak/understand a little when we were all together. it was a great trip, and i genuinely enjoyed his parents and had a lot of fun in his hometown. i left a few days before he did so that he'd have time to spend with them alone (and speak with them about his plans for us in the future). i asked him a few times how that conversation went, and he said that they are happy with us having a future together, but that getting engaged in december would be ""too fast."" that seemed absolutely crazy to me, and again it seemed like he was projecting his own views onto his parents. he also told me i needed to learn chinese before we got married (his parents speak perfect english but prefer chinese when they are with family), so i started doing rosetta stone.

&#x200b;

***october-december 2018***: around november, i started getting antsy that my boyfriend was going to change his mind again. he was starting to show his pattern of making excuses. for instance, one day he casually mentioned that he couldn't propose by december because he needed to save money (we share finances and money is not an issue for either of us). another time, he freaked out that i have student loans (most people in my profession do, and i have a very secure job, good pay, and automatic loan payments), and demanded that he see a spreadsheet of my finances before he could consider having a future together. luckily i already have this spreadsheet, which i showed him, and he calmed down.

in the meantime, my friends and family were starting to ask questions about the future wedding. although they had the best intentions, it was stressing me out because i was worried that after all this, there would be no wedding. i worked with my therapist on letting go of this stress, redirecting my family away from relationship questions. i also created a ""no nagging"" rule in my mind-- i stopped dropping hints, mentioning wedding/engagement, etc with my boyfriend (didn't do it much anyway, as i had learned my lesson from the ultimatum). we spent christmas together for the first time this year, and i really thought he would propose then. but he didn't, and i didn't bring it up or pout about it. he visited his family for new years and i was left in our city working, so it definitely didn't happen then.

&#x200b;

***january 2019:*** i accepted that he actually didn't follow through with what he said he would do, despite me holding up my end of the deal. i was the perfect girlfriend that he asked me to be, and i tried to use this an an opportunity for growth (both individually and within the relationship), and still nothing changed. i was still on the momentum of not nagging him and trying to suppress all of my thoughts of wanting to marry him. it's now to the point that i equate my own thoughts of marrying him with shame and self-loathing, like they are bad thoughts that i shouldn't have. i realize i've been feeling so embarrassed with my own desires for my future, which is so sad. but a few things have happened in the past few weeks that have made me realize that this is all bullshit. first, one of my superiors at work offered me some great opportunities at my job if i stay onboard long term. however, my boyfriend wants to think about moving us out of the city we live in because ""we don't like it here"" (i am actually okay with it for the most part). he also has given a hard no to ever moving back to my home state (his reason: my family lives there and they annoy him). i started thinking 'wow, this person is putting a lot of limits on my life for someone who still can't commit to me for the long term.'

then, this weekend i went back to my home state for my best friend's baby shower. also, i want to have kids, that's the main reason i am in any hurry to get married (biological clock is ticking). so yesterday, i was hanging out with my friend and her husband, helping them set up their nursery, and i had this ""aha!"" moment where i realized that it's okay for me to want to get married and have kids. there's no shame in having my own wants. and at this point, not only have my wants/desires been shut down by my boyfriend (no marriage, we can't stay in the city where i have job opportunities, we also can't live in my home state where my entire family is), but i've internalized this sense of shame about expressing or feeling anything that conflicts with his desires. so i'm starting to form a plan to move on, because this dude is taking more from my life that he's adding to it.

&#x200b;

i'm hoping to get anyone's opinion/advice/support about where to go from here. also i am willing to hear all the ""i told you so'"" from everyone who said i needed to leave this guy in march when i said i would. i totally deserve it. thanks for reading!

&#x200b;

***update***: wow, thank you reddit for the super thoughtful replies! i read each one (so far)! 

i spoke with my boyfriend last night about all of this. i started by asking what his roadblocks are and where he sees the relationship going. he brought up the fact that it's moving too fast for his parents, and some issues that he has with the relationship: 1. that we don't make decisions together (e.g. the fact that i want to stay in our city for career opportunities despite him wanting to move next year, also sometimes i make plans to hang out with friends on weekends when he is free instead of us planning the weekends together), 2. he worries about  the fact that i get a lot of amazon packages and he doesn't know what i am buying (showed him my amazon history, it's mostly household supplies that we both use, and occasional supplies for my hobby, but that's like $20/mo max). also this is all on my credit card (which i comfortably pay off each month) so i don't think i need to clear every purchase by him, and 3. he also doesn't like that i'm chronically 5 minutes late to everything (that's true and my fault). also, since it came up a lot in the comments, i wanted to mention that he explicitly said that none of this has to do with cultural barriers or the fact that we're an interracial couple. 

however, after all this, he said he's not ready for marriage. i was pretty pissed and told him i wished he told me this a year ago so i could have moved on. he basically tried to keep me around for another year so that he would have more time to figure out if he was ready. so i told him the relationship is over, and he is appearing to be in disbelief. he's trying to be really nice now (probably to get me to change my mind), but i'm remaining gently firm here.",8
"by eating first and asking questions later  

my fiance and i have been eating keto for the last 3 months. she recently bought these ""butter bombs"" that you put in your coffee/hot tea that adds fat to your diet. i saw half of one on the countertop and decided to give it a go because i hadn't used one yet.

i proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. i threw it in the blender and glugged it down. i thought it was weird that it didn't melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. it didn't taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.

smash cut to later in the evening when my fiance says to me as i'm watching tv, ""hey have you seen the other half of the air freshener wax that was on the countertop?"" smh. my fat ass thought it was food. i suppose i should go on amazon now and leave a review. 5 stars, would eat again.

-i always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. i never had problems with my parents before this. 

-i went to med school, still living with parents when i was 20, i dated someone who was 23

-dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says i cannot date j. 

-argument breaks out, dad says it's his house so either i agree or i move out. i say it's not fair as j has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. dad kicks me out. mom agrees with his decision. little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-i moved with j, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (i went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-years later, me and j (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (like really small but i'm happy with it). i ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. i let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  he came a few times. 

-today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when i was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. i said never and that i wasn't going to forgive them. bro says i'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, i say that's bullshit because dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. bro says i should at least let mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. i say mom was able to do something but didn't,but that bro's situation was different because he was only 15. bro is upset because he says mom and dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that i am dragging this entire situation. i told him that if he thinks i'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. he's angry and says that i need to move on and that i shouldn't be withholding them from seeing their grandchild. i say that they disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist.

"for telling step-daughter she's the reason for divorce yeah, i'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.

i came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). her mother is not happy. she hasn't been happy for a long time. her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids i've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.

she's made it no secret she hates me. i remember when she was 13 or 14, i paid for us to go to disney land as a family vacation (cliche, i know). she refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. i was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, i went along with it and stayed home.

stuff like that is the norm. she'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. she'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. it's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. but it's ruined the marriage, because i've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. anything i do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.

anyway, my wife and i separated over this. it's just too much for me to bare. but i'm not mad at my wife, i'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.

i decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. i didn't do this to spite her, because frankly i'm ready to move on with my life. i did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. i did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)

wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. say it's going to emotionally scar her. but quite frankly, i think she needed to be told.

"for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

a few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. her husband is a light black man. of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. the skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

i pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. she didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. i reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. neither has spoken to me since.

i've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes i feel bad about what happened. i just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because i would be devastated if i wasn't confident that i was the father of my future children. was i an asshole for asking privately?

edit- okay i get it i'm an asshole. i want to make it clear that i didn't think the triplets had different fathers. i'm not an idiot. i thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",3

edit 2: a lot of people are asking our ages and why we don't live together. i'm 20 years old, he's 22 years old. and we don't live together because we were given an eviction notice a few days before christmas telling us we had to vacate the premises by january 1st. it was such short notice, and right at christmas time, we had absolutely no money for a new apartment so we moved in with my parents. he lasted about 2 weeks in my parents house before deciding he couldn't live with them, he said it made him feel uncomfortable. so he moved back home with his family, almost 2 hours away from me and our son.

edit 3: my son was only in this post so people could understand that i'm not just being a whiny bitch because i got dumped. i'm upset because he not only walked out on me without any explanation, but he did the same to his kid. and please stop giving me shit for having a kid at 18. that was my decision, not yours. oh, and just so you assholes that were harassing me for getting evicted know, we didn't get evicted for not paying our rent. we got evicted because he invited friends over and they were smoking weed in the apartment whenever my son and i weren't around. we live in ny where weed isn't legal, so honestly he's lucky we only got evicted and he didn't end up in jail or worse, we lose our kid. so i'm not irresponsible for spending money on a trip months ago and getting evicted.",8

"ia my father left my 3y/o daughter about $500k in a trust, ex-husband (who lives in mn) wants to use the trust funds for living expenses my father left my daughter, who is 3, about $500k in a trust. the trustee is not a family member, but a professional trustee. my daughter is supposed to begin receiving the money at 25, but they explained that they have the power to dispense money early for the right circumstances, like a private school or medical bills - or, as they very loosely and briefly mentioned, basic living costs in an emergency hardship situation. they gave an example that if i were to become ill and unable to work, the trust could provide some level of assistance to ensure my daughter does has food on her plate and a roof over her head. however this was glossed over pretty quickly and i don't know the technical details.

about two months ago my ex husband quit his job because he said they are unwilling to be flexible with him for his debilitating migraines (his employer told me that he claims to have migraines but has never actually seen a doctor about them for treatment), and says he has been unable to find a new job and intends to instead pursue getting on disability, but expects that to take 2-3 years. he says that he will soon lose his apartment. he is unable to receive most government-based assistance because he scammed the system last year (lied about income to receive food assistance for which he was not qualified and got caught).

so, he has now approached the trustee and wants to use the trust money to pay for an apartment, utilities and a car until he is approved for disability. i was especially surprised about the car portion - he says he needs money to purchase a safer vehicle because his vehicle is old, rated poorly for crashes and does not have working seatbelts (which is a surprise to me - just a few weeks ago i buckled her into the back seat when he picked her up, so not sure what exactly he is claiming there).

i disagree with this use of the funds, particularly because he only has her for 6 days per month. i understood the ability to use the trust for living expenses should be limited to scenarios in which she is genuinely in danger of being homeless or neglected, and that is not the case as i provide everything she needs now and can do so all the time if he is unable to. my father intended the money to provide her with opportunities once she is old enough to use it wisely, not to facilitate my husband's visitation in our custody agreement.

since my ex husband has a history of committing fraud when receiving government assistance and also a history of faking illness (he lied to a previous employer to receive paid time off work claiming he was being treated for cancer when he was not), i do not trust that his intentions here are genuine. i suspect he sees the trust as a way that he can get free money so that he doesn't have to get another job.

anyhow, my question: since the trust is for the benefit of my daughter and she is obviously a minor, what can i do to ensure it is protected? should i assume that the trustee has her interests in mind and will not prematurely release money for something like this, or does it sound like there is real danger that he will drain the trust? is it possible for me to hire a lawyer to argue that the money should be saved for her later in life unless the circumstances are truly dire? i'm not sure if i can actually hire a lawyer and get them involved because i am not the trustee, the company is.

"cell phone repair guy stole my nudes!    just like the title said, dropped my phone off, an imessage was sent to an unfamiliar number while it was there - i could see it on imessage through my mac. it contained 5 of my more private photos.

edit 2: please stop giving me awards this is a throwaway account. spend your money on people who make dank memes

the title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

my fiance and i are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, summer 2021.

i make pretty good money for my age. in fact, i make more money than any of my friends or family, and i would bet i'm in the ""1%"" of my community. i try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. i should also add when we started dating, i was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

my fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. she was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  since then, she hasn't worked. i really didn't mind at all. i make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

i am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead i just would venmo her some cash weekly. it was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

she has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. i know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  she has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

i shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

i told her i would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so i could see exactly what she was spending it on. i could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but i hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

she blew up. telling me i wasn't trusting her and how i was the one against joint bank accounts so i should understand her privacy. yeah, huge red flags all over the place.

i talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying i was not respecting her privacy when i'm the one that demands it also.

so after flip-flopping about the issue a lot, i decided to just tell my husband (in a non demanding and non accusatory way as adviced by reddit) and honestly he was so understanding and wonderful about it that i now wonder why i was ever worried. he reassured me that i wasn't a horrible person and that he still loved me and that i just had a little problem that i needed help with. we're now looking for a good therapist for me. already seen one, going to see two more before deciding which one is best for me and take it from there. i can't wait to work through this so i don't have to feel the way i do or at least know how to deal with those feelings better.

"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to last vegas in january, only to be unfaithful and carry on an affair with a family friend (37m). this has been a whirlwind of events. i am in shock writing about it and need an outlet to express whats happened.

my gf and i have had an amazing relationship and always wanted a future and family together. this all changed and i no longer know the person i once loved. full disclosure: i have never suspected my girlfriend was capable of something like this. she has had the wool over everyones eyes.

in 2018, myself, my gf and her mother planned a weekend trip together to las vegas for her moms friends 60th birthday. plane tickets were bought, accommodation arranged, and a whole weekend of events was planned from jan 11 – 14. what could go wrong.

come christmas time, said friend (60f) from las vegas flew up to our hometown (where she is from), with her extended family to celebrate christmas in canada. she has a son (37m). over christmas eve, christmas day, and boxing day, we hung out at this families air bnb house in our hometown and i got to know them very well. i consider myself to be very observant, and i noticed zero interaction between the son (37m) and my girlfriend (24f). after christmas, the family flew back to las vegas and awaited our arrival for the january weekend.

here is where i should have clued in, which i partially did, just not to the extent that would have helped. about a week before las vegas, my girlfriend informed me that the boyfriends of couples who were supposed to fly down to las vegas had bailed out on the trip, and slowly the trip was turning into a 'girls trip.' my girlfriend never outright expressed to me she didn't want me going, but did her best to ensure me i wouldn't have fun there. 3 days before we leave, my girlfriend outright tells me i cannot come; accommodations have been rearranged and i'm no longer invited on the trip. given that i had paid for this trip, i was visibly upset. i expressed that i didn't feel as if this was a partnered decision but rather her trying to intentionally exclude me from something i was invited to. ultimately, she left the decision up to me. i decided it didn't feel right at this point to go unless i was convinced she wanted me there, which i wasn't. friday came and went, she flew with her mom, i stayed home.

my girlfriend ended up losing her passport down there. (the lie detector test determined that was a lie.) she stayed a few days extra and flew back. she met up with me the following friday and told me she no longer is happy in our relationship and wants to break things off, hoping that we will get back together in the future. i protested, but understood from our current spat that something wasn't right and that we should go our separate ways. maybe one day we would get back together.

this leads us all to today. for the last month, my ex girlfriend and i have been communicating on and off (phone and texting) but have never seen each other. she has been extremely busy preparing for her teaching practicum (so i thought). she and i would both initiate conversation, and discuss our relationship and talk about working things out in the future. she and i both told each other we had no interest in seeing other people. on valentines day, she even messaged me saying how we should be together and she misses me.

after struggling to move on with my life i decided today was the day i would head over to her parents house (where she lives) and express my feelings and ask if this could be worked out once and for all. by pure coincidence (because nobody else was home at the time) and the kindness of a step-father, the truth was revealed to me.

i called her house and asked her step-dad respectfully if he'd allow me to come to the door and speak with my ex. him and i got along great and he said i'm always welcome to come and talk but unfortunately, she is not there and neither is her mother. she is in banff during her 'busy practicum weekend'. her step-father sat me down and began with this: ""i'm assuming you're here because you don't know everything. if you knew everything, i don't think you'd be here. i have been told by gf, gf mom, and other family members not to tell you anything, but i have a lot of respect for you. my ex-wife of 10 years cheated on me and i know how it feels. anything you ask me, i will answer completely honestly.""

confused, i sat down where everything had been explained to me. my girlfriend had begun an affair in las vegas with the son (37f) of her moms best friend. every weekend since, he has been flying my ex-gf down to las vegas to meet him and this past weekend took her to banff with the whole family. keep in mind, he is divorced, and has 2 kids (8 and 10). i am absolutely disgusted and feel sick about what really happened. i don't even know how this happened.

i cannot thank this man enough for telling me the truth which nobody felt the need to pass onto me. i feel betrayed, deceived, heartbroken, and angry. suffice to say, i am in an absolute state of shock.

i simply texted her saying ""i know everything, never contact me again,"" and my phone has been blowing up ever since. her demanding to know who told me, her denying what has happened, her being angry with me.

i'm completely lost reddit. i thought i was going to marry this girl one day. how does someone change in the blink of an eye. i learned more about my girlfriend in 30 mins than i did over the course of 3.5 years.

where do i go from here? advice very much welcome.

update: thanks for all the comments everyone. i've read them all and they do show the upsides to this garbage situation. since this shit storm began, my ex returned from her trip and figured out within a few hours who spilled the beans. just to clarify: the step-dad assured me on my way out that he would be crucified for this and had accepted his fate. her house got turned upside down like the circus it is and i've been being blamed for it all. i haven't responded to text/calls from my ex, her mother, or their house. after denying what had taken place, i just assume at this point it will be more lies. she has every reason to lie about it. whereas, the step-dad had every reason not to lie. thanks again everyone for the support and advice. the succubus has been phone blocked and on all social media.

"- mad at my wife for throwing away pendant from previous marriage i'm really upset with my wife after what she's done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. so i'm posting here to get an unbiased perspective.

i've been married to my current wife for three years. we dated for 2 years before getting married. before meeting my current wife i had been married to my ""high school sweetheart"" for well over a decade.

my late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. it was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and i didn't start dating again for several years after the fact. i never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

i've always had a momento from my previous marriage. it was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. she gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. before meeting my current wife i would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

when i met my current wife she wasn't comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. so i started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it's an extremely important item to me. for a time she accepted that until recently.

over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she'd bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding i get rid of it. i can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but i had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... why can't she accept it's very important to me?

long story short, when i was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. when i found out i broke down because it was literally the last thing i had to remember my late wife.

 i don't know. maybe i am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. aita?

"for using poop bags for my daughter's birthday party? my daughter just turned 6. we had a birthday party for her on saturday. that morning was pretty hectic. i was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and i didn't notice.

all that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""sarah"" and it's ""sara"" and i said, ""who cares, just scrape off the h"" but she insisted on returning it. so i said ""fine whatever."" and then as she's leaving she says since i screwed up already i should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

and i go into the kitchen and i ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" she says ""the gift bags."" i found all the candy and toys and what i thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. so i make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

my wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt i made at helping. so a little while after that, the guests arrive. the day went pretty well until the end. my daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. my wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until i got the box. she looked inside an was horrified

""what the fuck is this?"" she whispers. and she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. i follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. she's so embarrassed. why? she wont say. i'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. i then i just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically i'm stupid and i've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? i tell her ""it's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. she says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

so yeah i've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. i told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said i was a huge asshole and she's mad that i dont think it's a big deal. and i still dont. actually, i think i'm the one that should be mad at her for keeping this going for almost a week.

so, reddit, aita?

"for ""double-reporting"" an employee (to his boss, and then to corporate) and probably getting him fired? my husband and i have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is african american and i am white (this will be important later on in the story). my son just got his driver's permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. the other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

i scolded my son and gave a ""sorry"" wave to the driver. at the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. his car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. he rolled down the window and shouted the n-word at my son. my son's face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. the encounter **sickened** me.

i did some research on the company; at one point i even plugged them into facebook. they have a very active facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. i called the company and reported the man's behavior, describing him very vividly. they informed me that they knew exactly who i was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. i had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

two months later, when i was browsing facebook kind of boredly one day, the company's name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it i clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. one of the very first photos/posts i saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. to my horror, i saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. meaning they didn't fire him.

the company is part of a nationwide chain, so i called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person i could get to, and i reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn't fire him. the man i spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person i'd reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have ""no place"" and ""no future"" in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee's career is now toast.

was it right of me to ""double-report"" this guy? i'm sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that i was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. am i an asshole or a ""karen"" for not dropping this matter?",3

i am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and i'll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

i'd spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days i'd be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work i'd be missing. 

unfortunately, one of the days i'll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

his request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if i missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

my professors were comfortable marking these as ""reported absences"" which basically means there was a justification like a doctor's note or other official documentation. 

i showed the deans that i was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn't  even really like i had a choice. i figured that would be enough documentation. 

the dean said that ""personal non-medical conflicts"" could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if i'd just  slept through class). they suggested i apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise i'd be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

this attack took enough from me already, i went to great lengths to be sure i didn't miss a day of school while recovering, i do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

i spoke to the title ix office who'd promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence.

"update pa i followed and reported a drunk driver, then i got a ticket for driving past curfew this is an update to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

i took the advice that i was given and i pled not guilty. last week i went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200b;

i brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that i called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. i also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and i printed out a copy of the ""justification"" law(https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/conscheck.cfm?txttype=htm&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

the hearing started with the officer saying that i was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why i was there, and that i voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. he said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

then it was my turn to speak. i said that while i did drive past curfew, it was because i had noticed an erratic driver and i was following him because i thought he was going to hurt someone. i felt that if i had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. i gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and i said that i would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. i argued that i had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 bac. (the judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the bac.)

finally, i brought up the justification defense. i argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. i said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because i drove in an otherwise safe manner.

the judge agreed and found me not guilty! he said that i had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that i had done the right thing. i'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

"a male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. he just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists. spa is in maryland. a friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. he is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. he has not spoken with management yet. he just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

minor update: i advised him of his many options after reading the comments. he went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

i'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. the mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room. 

thank you everyone for the comments. if this  issue comes up again he will be going over their heads to handle this legally. ",2
"by thinking divorce was an april fools gag let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

my borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. they told the family they are getting divorced. i broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying i'm no april fool.

wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

i don't think i'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. this blew up and i just got multiple texts from my wife telling me i fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... and i didn't change any names

final edit. fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on reddit) how big of a dumbass i am.

parents of reddit: how do you feel when your kid brings back a girlfriend/boyfriend? how do you decide whether you like them or not? ,1
"by showing my grandmom that she had been living a lie for almost 30 years. this did happen today. my grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. she doesn't eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. one of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. she says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. so she keeps changing the position of my bed when i am away for work. when i come back, i reposition it my way so that i don't get sunlight on my face early morning. 
today, she was repositioning the room while i was there which annoyed me. so i took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that i was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. infact i was pointing east . i instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. and she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. i pointed it out to her. i thought she would take it lightly. oh man i was wrong. i fucked up biig time. she lost herself. she started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. i am looking at her old compass right now and i can say it doesn't seem right at all. i think i will have to fix this issue today itself. she is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn't great. how stupid am i. 

tl;dr : i fucked up by showing my grandmother that she was sleeping with her bed pointing north which she is strictly against cause of her superstitious beliefs. she did not take it well . 

edit 1: a lot of you are asking me how she moves furniture at the age of 90. well she doesnt do it herself, she has a helper who is supposed to take care of her personally but my grandmother doesn't like the idea of employing someone particularly for her so she gives her household chores to keep her busy.
edit 2: yes the caregiver gets paid extra for this. we tell her not to do the chores  and i assure you it's not that regular. ",4
"if two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped i see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. if two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? the logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? i will never understand this or accept it. i agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. i cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

edit: i've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things i think i should clarify. i absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. i have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what i have seen and what i believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

"for wanting my daughter's boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage? i'm the dad of a 25 year old young woman who i love very much. i've been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and i enjoy my time with her, but there's one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

she exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, i realized she needed professional help. throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. with an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. she received an aspd diagnosis at 18, and i had suspected it for long prior.

after her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. she's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. she uses that old dating guide ""the rules"" like a bible. she currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who i have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). he is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

but i doubt she loves him. we've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. when she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. she has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. while she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, i highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. i've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or i will**; to which she always responds, ""i know you wouldn't dare."" i actually would - i really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

i'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. it's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. aita?",3

"if ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for ""free"", search for ""open source"" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware the reasoning being if you type ""free"", generally you will be advertised to or get the lite version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to.

open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

this has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

edit: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't mean that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

i am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

as this thread has gained a lot of traction let's address some points: yes, we know you can torrent a paid-for application. hilarious as it is for you to keep posting it, you don't need to tell us. open source is still valid for those of us who believe in privacy, transparency and actually supporting a developer. we are aware of pirating websites, i promise.

"for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay? a very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. i've never objected to people crossing our land as i'm an avid hiker and don't want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. it's basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. so she'll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it's a multi day hike). 

it made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. it ""feels like"" 40-45 degrees celsius during june-july. today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. they said they were out of water and asked if i could refill their water bottles. i told them i could for 50cents a bottle. the reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). we aren't connected to an endless supply of water.

they were furious that i refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. i told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (i've drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted i top them up. 

they had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. so i refilled the young girl's bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. they refused and very angrily went on their way. my wife says i should have filled them up, but imo so long as the little girl is okay i don't think they deserved anything given their attitude.",3

"(update) surprise divorce, husband cleared bank accounts update from: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9xicm3/husband_surprised_me_with_a_divorce_cleaned_out/?utm_source=reddit-android

i wasn't able to get much done over the weekend except sell the wedding ring for some food/diaper money. today however was really busy, i spoke to a few people i was able to get in contact with through legal aid! 

i'm told by the end of the week i should be with an attorney who can begin helping me file everything i need to begin doing and hopefully begin tracking down where he's put all the money and get some back so i can continue to survive until i can be approved for childcare through state benefits and begin working again. 

i'm really surprised about how often this happens, there are entire places dedicated to helping men and women who have their wives/husband's do this to them. 

i am filing for divorce, before he can hopefully and for the return of the money into our account and an order to continue assisting with bills, child support and other necessities such as diapers, mortgage etc.

i probably will not have another update to this for a good long time but so many people wanted to make sure i was going to be ok and with everyone's advice to contact legal aid etc it looks like it hopefully might get better soon! i also contacted the bank and other bills that are coming up that i won't make and explained the situation. they are somewhat understanding and hopefully i'll be back at work soon to keep current.

"update: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything? original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so i got lots of feedback on what to do here. a good majority of the commenters told me to say something. to clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but i was never planning on doing nothing. of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. i just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which i ended up getting from alison, the third party friend. some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me i was a bad friend. some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. well all of you were somewhat right. here's how it went down: 

i messaged alison early on in the day, shortly after i made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. i said to alison that i needed to tell aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. this was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that alison came over too. we all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about mary. alison showed him the text screenshots of mary talking to her ex, and also told aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

what was the most surprising was his reaction. he took it very well. he first got very quiet, and just nodded. aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. he was not aware of the hookups, but he and mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. he told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. there were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. he knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

we started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. he cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. then he got angry. at her, and even more so at the guy. some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. we told him a million times how much better he deserved. he's definitely not going to marry her. 

thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. we saved a good man from heartbreak!

"my son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family i'm going to preface this by saying i love all three of my sons equally. they are 29, 24 and 22. it is my unequivocal truth.

it's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

after years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and i have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. we let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

i disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but i have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

after losing literally everything after my divorce, i have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. all three of our sons work in the business.

a week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. i was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. my oldest son managed to see it.

our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. my oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

i feel like i have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. my ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

if she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

the plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

my son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. he stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and i. our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

i am devastated. i have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him i want the will to be changed to split everything equally. but the damage is done.

he's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). his brothers and my wife and i are so hurt hearing this. it couldn't be any further than the truth. it's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

he has refused to come in to work since the past week and i've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

i don't know how to fix this. he won't take my calls.

my ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on facebook that i am considering legal action over. but i know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

i'm not sure how to salvage this. and i am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. my younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. it's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. my wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

tl;dr my oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. but now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after i have tried to fix it.",8

me arguing in a foreign language obviously makes it much harder for me to get my point across. but even in my own language i struggle to explain well. however i don't think just because i don't talk well or don't use difficult words or studder here and there should ever take away from the argument i'm making. if people weren't so obsessed with showing off how clever they are they would let their counterpart finish what they have to say and listen  instead of seeing their insecurities or shortcomings as an apportunity to make them look stupid or overpower them and ""win"" the argument.

i mean what does that even mean ""win"" an argument. the point is to get to a consensus and not imposing your viewpoint.

if you talk to somebody and they don't express themselves as nicely as you do, be the bigger person and let them talk and try and make their point. your argument should rest only on the content and not on the delivery. and if you find that you can't win arguments if you don't use the trick of being super eloquent, maybe take it as an opportunity to learn and don't see it as defeat.",6
"by swallowing my little sister's birthday present i am so beside myself with shame that i almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

but reddit karma is my mistress and i must heed her sweet call. 

so yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), i was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

now, i cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. i looked at that ring in my hand and i just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a bugs bunny cartoon. my primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

so i did it.

i think it was the next split second when i saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that i realized what a horrible mistake i had made. 

so my little sister runs screaming from my room and i hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as i admitted that i, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. no, i didn't know why i did it. yes, i am an idiot. no one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

so brief intermission from my sister's birthday as i make a quick excursion to the er, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them i was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. they took a couple x-rays and i hung around the er for about 8 hours before they broke the news that i was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

i shat out the ring this morning. 

happy birthday sis.

back in college, i shared a room with a 4'9 dude and he was nice man. he would always leave everything spotless, he was an amazing wingman and he always managed to make sure that when we had a few people over that they'd all have food readily available and drinks etc. he was so cool. anyway, he told me he was going to have a date and asked if i'd be going to my friends house for the night (he didn't live too far and i had been talking about meeting him one of the days) i was like ""yeah maybe, ohhh i see you want the room tonight i got you don't worry"". so he's all nervous about his date and i give him a pep talk i said ""you're a good man, your dates gonna be great and you definitely look ace!"" he was all hyped up and left. 

i called my buddy and asked if he was at home, he was actually at work. but, he told me he'll be back home within a couple hours or so. now, my roommate who was on his date told me he would ring or text me to let me know he got back safe to the room and to give me the heads up when to leave. 

so, i figured i got plenty of time. i laid on the bed and basically waited for two hours to go by to get a phone call from my buddy to tell me he had finished work. but, i instead get a text message from him saying he had finished work and that he'll be getting home a lot later than expected. still no sign from my roommate on his date though (who said he'll ring/message me if he's bringing his date back)

then *i ended up falling asleep*

again after waiting for my buddy to message me when he's free to meet. after some time passes i begin to wake up a little because i hear some distorted voices, giggling and bed creaking . i'm like ""oh fuck"" he's with his date, him and her are gonna be pissed if i ruin their night now by waking up, ""why didn't he text me or ring?!!"". so, i stayed stationary and pretended to be asleep. i hear them both get outta bed and lay on the floor (i imagine cause of the bed creaking). i then start to hear the almighty thunderous clapping of balls and i'm seriously trying to hold my laughter in _but_ then i i heard moaning like a japanese anime character.. which confused me. anyway at this point i'm still trying to hold my laughter in, i realised i had knocked my phone near the edge of the bed because of my inability to keep my composure, so i decided to try and grab it splinter cell lock picking style. i grab the phone without being noticed and in that moment curiosity got the better of me. the ball slamming stopped and it went quiet so i decided then take a slight peak to see if him and his date was asleep and if the coast was clear.. *nope!* as i opened my eye all i see is a 6'7, huge bald black dude followed by the deepest male voice i've ever heard in my entire life say ""now say you want more now"" and continue the almighty thunderous ball slamming i see my 4'9 roommate getting absolutely destroyed up and down like a goddamn yo yo waving his arms in the sky like when you was a kid and needed a piss but you was in class and you had to raise your hand impatiently to get the teachers attention to go to the bathroom. i again stayed stationary as possible with tears of laughter running down my eyes. all the business stopped and the behemoth of a man left the dorm and my roommate just went straight to bed humming. 

the next day i got up early, showered and decided to get mcdonalds breakfast for myself and my roommate and a strong coffee (believe me, even i felt exhausted after all of that). i come back to the room to see my roommate watching tv as if nothing happened whatsoever. i said ""well tell me about the date? was she nice?"" whilst he grinned and ate his sausage mcmuffin. he just looked at me and said ""it was so much fun we're going to meet again very soon"". 

now, i didn't want to say anything because his sexuality is his business and he'll say when the time was right (he did a month later). so, i said ""i'm glad you had a good time"". as i leave the room and make my way down the hallway, what do i see?? the behemoth black dude walking down hallway with the look of a man on a mission, literally like terminator as he walks through the hallway of the psychiatric hospital. i took a last glance through the window while the dude made his way to my room. so, when my friend said ""we're going to meet again _soon_"" little did i know it would be less than 10 hours from the other night. but at least this time they had all the privacy they wanted and i didn't have to almost die of laughter. 

tl;dr - roommate went on a date, brought back home his date, didn't know his date was another dude, i fell asleep and eventually woke up to see him getting destroyed by a dude the size of bob sapp(https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/071/282/bobsapp_crop_north.jpg?1357083029&amp;w=630&amp;h=420) who came back less than 10 hours later for round two. and i'm 99% certain he ate my mcdonalds hashbrown that i left on the side.

"my wife (f30) told me that she cheated on me (m28) and i honestly don't know what to do we have been married for over 5 and a half years. i love her so much. we finally got our own place on december 2018 and things were looking up for us. these 5 years were so magical and i always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that i would marry her again.

this past tuesday, my lead told us that we can vto  (volunteer time off. i work night shift) so my co worker gave me a ride home. (my wife and i share a car). when he dropped me off, i noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. i thought that she parked somewhere else.

as soon as i went inside, i went to our bedroom so that i can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that i am home. the plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work.

she wasn't in the room. she wasn't home. so i called her and asked her where she was. when she answered, she sound like she just woke up.

my heart broke because i had a feeling of what was going on. she made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. i gave her the benefit of the doubt.

so i was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. she sat on the bed and i asked her if she was okay. she wouldn't answer and began to cry. then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. she said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened.

i am sad. i honestly thought this would never happen to me. i don't know what to do. we had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. we agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, i am strongly considering in divorcing her. i can't even look at her anymore. the thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. she wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore.

what should i do? am i overreacting?  i honestly thought of killing myself. i am so sad. she was my everything.

tldr;   wife confessed to cheating. i am so sad. thinking of killing myself.  what do i do?

&#x200b;

thank you

&#x200b;

edit to say: just got back from my long ass walk since posting this (0500 pst) i am so surprised for the support! <3

thanks to all that replied to me with your advice. i still love her and ultimately, even though it is tough for me,  i forgive her. time will heal this pain and honestly, i love her too much to end this.  we have been through so much and have so many wonderful memories. i honestly can't imagine being with another person.  she is truly sorry that she cheated on me. most wont agree with this, but i will give her another chance and see where this goes.

and no, i wont kill myself. i promise.  i really appreciate your concerns and replies. it makes me happy that you all took time out of your busy lives to reply to me. take care everyone and i'll update as time goes on.. <3

&#x200b;

\*\*\*update 09/13:\*\*\*

i have been reading the comments. i understand that to most it is stupid that i am still with her. i understand. trust me. we have been talking a lot. she is truly sorry and i forgive her. i put her mistake behind me and i am looking forward in fixing our marriage.  we plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. the reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (we will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week.

&#x200b;

we are working this out. we are still living together. we are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. honestly, it has been going well. things are looking up because soon, i will be transferring to day shift so that i can spend time with her, sleep with her and have the normal schedule that i have been longing for. i still want her in my life and i don't see divorce. we will work this out.

again, thank you all for helping me in my time of need. i am really grateful that you all took the time in giving me advice. it helps. ill update as time goes on. <3",8
"bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike **tl;dr: short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

the recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

she survived, but she easily could have died. *on a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

i myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. the only time i've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. i got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. it really can happen to just about anyone. i got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

and now, with the popularity of parks exploding, i see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. if anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

so: never go unprepared. get a wide-mouth nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

the things i have in mine include:

\- survival heating blanket

\- plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- whistle

\- flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- critical meds and bandages

\- zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- compass (if you're able to use it)

\- paracord

\- knife

\- duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (i always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing i can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - i've experienced this first-hand).

\- iodine tabs for water

\- beef jerky

\- energy gel

**edit:** because it may be of interest: i just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that i don't mention in the list. for reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**edit 2:** i wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. the kit i describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

the kit i mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

for people wanting to see the kit i made, or skeptical it can be done - just google nalgene survival kit. lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than i have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *this kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*",9

today when she said ""morning slim"" i replied ""morning chunky"" and she got upset and actually started crying. everybody here at work, (only 6 of us total) is saying i'm wrong and i should apologize because being called fat is ""different"" than being called skinny because being called skinny is a ""compliment"". i said as long as she calls me slim, i will call her chunky and now i'm the bad person. if i don't apologize? the owner/manager has completely ignored the situation saying it's ""a high school issue and we should figure it out"".

edit for more info: we don't have hr. there's only 6 of us working here (cupcake shop). we are all regular employees. i went to the owner before i called her chunky and i asked him to talk to her because i felt she was harassing me. that's when he said we can handle it ourselves. that's why i called her chunky. i told her to stop calling me slim and i didn't like it and she continued to do it. she didn't stop doing it after i asked multiple times and i didn't know what to do besides what she was doing to me. she brought up my weight, i brought up her's.",3

"i (m 31) am growing tired of my wife's (f 31) hangups on sex..... ive been with my wife for about 15 years, if you include the time we dated. we have been married for 11 years in august. 

i love my wife, but the sex just fucking sucks. and it has sucked for the last 5 years or so. every now and then she will get adventurous and try a different position, but its almost always missionary or ""doggy style"". sometimes she gets on top, but its rare.

i constantly tell her how beautiful she is, i tell her how much she means to me, and i try my best to do whatever i can to lay signals that im into her. i hug her, i stand close to her in public, i make it well known that im pretty damn proud to be with her. 

she reciprocates none of it. she never comes on to me unless i straight up ask her to (seriously, ill ask, ""can you do me tonight?"") she doesn't spontaneously get playful (in an adult way), she does not masturbate....^ever. i work long hours, and ill come home and playfully ask if she got adventurous with any of the toys that we have (which are literally collecting dust, btw) and she just snips ""no"" in a fashion like it would be disgusting if she did so. she gets upset if i cum anywhere but inside her or out away from her, as its an inconvenience to be cummed on (one time she got pissed because she had just showered and i came on top of her pussy). she keeps the same positions, same setting (always on our bed, on my side), orgasms and goes to sleep. it fucking sucks. the sexiness factor is zero. i love that fucking woman to death but the intimacy isn't there at all and im not sure i can do it anymore. its like its a chore for her, and not something she looks forward to. 

anywho, it came to head tonight. i asked her if we could, ya know, tonight before bed. she said yes. so the time comes, she was on me and i wasn't totally into it, so i started to get soft. i made up a bullshit excuse, and asked her to just stroke me to get me hard again (oral would be totally out, as i had been inside her, and that is an absolute no go zone for her, so i didn't ask). so she climbs off me and proceeds to take my cock in between her index finger and her thumb and stroke me as she didn't want to touch my dick because it had been inside her. i lost it. i said how depressing it was that she didnt even want to *touch* my dick after it had been inside her. this is supposed to be our sexy time and she is out here acting like everything is icky and im fucking done with it. she has since rolled over and went to bed without saying goodnight.

i cant live like this. there is no adventure, no surprise, and no spontaneity.  im too fucking young to be having old people sex for the next 20 years. this was probably more of a rant than an advice piece, but damn.

"for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into? title says it all. my friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. she dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have candy crush on her phone.

so i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

after dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

i feel like telling people (politely) when they've used them incorrectly is the right thing to do, and saying ""language is fluid"" isn't appropriate for such a serious mistake. i think it's fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling, but using the wrong ""there"" actually changes the meaning of a sentence (often to nonsense), since the *wrong word* is being used.

"update texas my mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. however, the police is still alive, and when i showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. how can i get my cat back? link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

hello,

first off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. i didn't feel like advice to steal my cat back was 'legal' (thus, being in this subreddit), so i took one users advice to talk to the director of animal control in my mom's city.

she basically told me that the police have no idea what they're doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. she said that the only thing i can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as 'stolen property'. she said the police will understand what to do if a i reference my cat as 'property' and not an animal.

i went to the police station and the police threw me around again. despite i tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn't 'property'. after 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom's texts. 

the cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, i can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my 'stolen property'.

we get to my mom's house and she's not there. we look around the outside of her house and find no signs of kitty either. i call her and ask her where she is, and told her that i was at her house with the police. she said, in quote, ""i took the cat and ran off into oklahoma and i'm not ever coming back."" 

the police said they can't help me since they don't have jurisdiction in oklahoma. 

i went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so i left because i can't afford it. on my way home, i contacted adult protective services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. so i hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

i also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into oklahoma. my mom played the 'poor me' card, so my family bought into it. and somehow, i'm now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... when i got home, i cut everyone out. all of my family. i separated every single tie i had to them.

i've had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if i'm being open about the situation, i was a victim of childhood abuse. that cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me i won't be able to get him back. i ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now i'm getting help for my own mental health. this situation broke me, and right now, i'm trying to recover.

thank you everyone for listening. 

**tl;dr:** my cat is gone and i'll never get him back.",2

"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving? when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

"my(25m) girlfriend(22f) wants to share our incomes, thing is, i make roughly 7 times as much, advice please so here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. my girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, i finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company i did my internship at and within a year i got a promotion and a large payraise and i am now making roughly 150k a year, while she makes 20k a year.

now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place i bought so i pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, phone bill, netflix and so forth.

now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently i pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

now she seems to be jealous i got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs i put the majority in my savings account.

in my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

so what do i do, i hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if i am honest i am questioning my relationship as there is no way i am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

edit: so, there are so many comments i am having a hard time keeping up with it. if i don't respond, know that i am trying to at least read your comment. but currently when i read and respond to 1 comment i get 10 more! haha. i just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... even those who yell about mgow or something and those who are if the opinion i need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in! i had not expected my post to blow up like this though hahaha.",8

"there is no reason to be proud to be gay. to start; i have nothing against gay people, and i am not homophobic. sad i need to say this, but moving on.

so you like the same sex, big fucking deal. nobody cares. i like the opposite sex but you don't see me throwing a parade and throwing my sexuality at people who don't give a shit. 

i have uncles who are gay and have been together since the 80's, and they feel that this stuff does more harm than good. if somebody is homophobic; do you think that seeing two guys in thongs rubbing against each other on a float once a year is gonna change their minds?

"update my (29m) girlfriend (24f) cancelled weekend plans to attend a house party, invited a male friend. am i being unreasonable in ending it? update to this(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cbot23/my_29m_girlfriend_24f_cancelled_weekend_plans_to/).

&#x200b;

we spoke via text and then i called her at lunch. it escalated where i was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that i should trust her.

&#x200b;

i stated they can be friends, but i expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something i'm comfortable with, and i try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because i know better.

i expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

she doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200b;

i don't think she cheated. i know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. some men are okay with that, i'm evidently not.

&#x200b;

she's a wonderful woman, she's just not the woman for me.

she wants to act like she's single, well now she is.",8
"new york - i've been visited by cps 8 times, to enquire about a child i don't have. at what point it becomes harassment or stalking? there's a cps agent that seems to be convinced that i have a child and i'm locking the child in my home. first time i was visited, i was very understanding. i allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. everything seemed fine. obviously no child and no evidence of one, because i don't have a child.

this was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until i stopped cooperating. i told her that from now on the only way i'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. a few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. the officer told me that it will be a lot easier if i allowed them to look at my house, i allowed the officer to do that by himself. again, no child was found. his search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times i have refused to talk to her. once, as i left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. it definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. i called the police but it went nowhere. i have called the cps office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. this last incident happened this last thursday.

this woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. everyone has told her that i don't have a child. 

this definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. if this was a legitimate cps operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, i'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance i guess? but they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. so maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

this is really going too far and is affecting my life. i actually fear for my safety now. i will install security cameras this week and will call the police if i found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the cps.

do i have a legal recourse here? like filing a restraining order against the cps (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? this definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. not sure how stalking is defined legally. what's the best way to stop her?

"by revealing that i had secretly hid in my roomate's closet during his pre-bedtime ritual obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

i lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we'll call them ned and ethan. the three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. the most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out adam sandler's at a medium pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (everyone thinks they're hilarious in college, i know).
the most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. but one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in ned's bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of adam sandler on my shitty washburn 6-string. 

trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but ned was no random college student. ned was the 6'3"" milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. in short, ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. so to me, that meant that whenever ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

so i grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he'd think i had went to bed early), and snuck into ned's bedroom to position myself in his closet. it was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, like this(https://cdn.instructables.com/fya/uc2h/hmvja37y/fyauc2hhmvja37y.medium.jpg). ned's bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so i'd have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and ned, in case i accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. but directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was ned's computer and desk. 
ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, i could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. the 12 inch proximity of ned spiked my adrenaline, and i began to control my breathing. my back was pressed against coat hangers, and i had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and i had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. (artist depiction(https://i.imgur.com/xmlm5bh.png))

as ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. ned did not reach for his glass of water. ned did not opt for the pajamas. ned did not leave his desk. ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

a million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. if i make myself known now, he'd be immensely embarrassed and angry that i had just violated his privacy. but if i *didn't* speak up now, chances are i'd have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. so i was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. it felt like i was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

my hands began to cramp as i awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn't generate an ounce of noise. my legs began to jitter as i compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as i waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell i was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

after ned's satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that i had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and i had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. all critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until i remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. but with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would i get the phone out my pocket? somehow i did, and i texted ethan in the next room over:

> foogama: in ned's closet. was trying to do medium pace gag. ned started wanking before i could start. now i'm stuck in the closet and can't get out. need help.
> 
> ethan: lol right.
> 
> foogama: ethan, i'm dead serious. i need you to help create a distraction for ned so that i can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
> 
> ethan: …we're going to need to have a talk later.

right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). it was 10:45pm on a thursday, but i could hear ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **""hello? why yes ned is here. is everything okay? ned! ned come here, phone for you!""** ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. how this never raised suspicion, i'll never know. it was a cordless phone. there was no need for ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. but thank god he did. i bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some ""stranger"" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

i was forever in debt to ethan for saving my ass, and we never told ned. that is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in ned's wedding. there was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we ""found interesting"" about ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, i was convinced by ethan to write ""that he enjoys anal sex with large black women"" because it would make a fun ""bachelor story"" over 10 years after the fact.

but of course that's not what happened. the best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we'd be reading the bride's, and they'd be reading ned's. and of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. i didn't even know her name. i had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

the bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. he immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. i immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. ethan and i waited for ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. we were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

**tl;dr – hid in my roommate's closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride's best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**

i've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

edit: thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for ned. ned is a really great guy and i'm sure we'll be fine.

"my (21f) boyfriend (22m) said he wouldn't want to date me if i had slept with as many people as him. i'm not to sure how this was brought up but last night we were laying in bed when he said that if i had had slept with as many people as him (roughly 30) then he wouldn't have wanted to date me. he also said that it's a turn off that i slept with him on the first date and he's surprised that he like me because of this. 

he said something about it being instinctual for guys to want to sleep with a lot of girl and a status thing, which is why it makes it okay for him to have that history and not me.

i find this logic very sexist and full of double standard. i'm super pissed and not sure how to handle it.

"by ruining a vegetarian's love of gummy candy i like to have some gummy bears at my desk in the morning. because every day is a good day when you start it with gummy bears. i always offer some to anyone who happens to pass through my office. one person in our office is a vegetarian, i am aware of this. they passed by as another person and i were enjoying gummy bears, i quickly began to offer them one and then halfway through my offer i was like ""oh sorry, right! you won't want these!"" 

they responded with ""why wouldn't i?! i love gummy bears!"" i stared awkwardly for a moment before responding with ""well, they have beef gelatin in them."" 

them: ""what do you mean beef gelatin? why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?""

me: ""i thought all gelatin came from animals.""

them: ""are you serious? you aren't serious right? i love gummy bears. my kid and i eat them together all the time."" (kid is vegetarian as well)

me (now panicking): ""i think i am. i don't know. maybe you're right! i'm 
sorry! you're welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.""

they now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. i swear i could see them going through the stages of grief because i know how sad i would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. so by shattering a vegetarian's blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.

tl;dr by informing a vegetarian who loves gummy bears that gelatin comes from animals, thus ruining gummy bears for them (and subsequently their child)

edit: omg. front page. all you guys are awesome! and i'm learning so much! i just want to clarify a couple of items. first, this coworker of mine isn't preachy at all or anything. i just happen to know their choice and respect it, i have no idea if it's for health or ethical or sensory reasons or whatever. second, my understanding is that their child chooses to also follow a vegetarian diet but is encouraged to try anything they want, so no forced vegetarianism on the child (yay!). i'm excited about all the dialogue. and feeling a little drunk on the power of knowledge. but pretty please don't bash my co-worker for their dietary choices because, ultimately, it is their choice :)...and they don't judge me for eating candy for breakfast. thanks reddit world!

edit2: formatting (thank you to the user who showed me the way. hopefully it's a bit better now). also, thank you for the awards!! but! it they are costing you money, please donate said money to a charity near you that feeds hungry people. or buy a vegetarian friend a bag of vegetarian friendly gummy bears!",4

"for having an almanac? a bit of backstory. i met my wife in the summer of 2008. she was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. i had gone to pick up some boxes because i was moving. out walked my sara...it was close to the end of her shift. and working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (seriously, i don't care what ddd says, that place is gross.) she was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...i'm pretty sure i fell in love right then and there that wonderful may night. (inb4 ""thats so old fashioned!!!"" don't care. when you know, you know.) i wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
it started after our first date. she had mentioned she loves lilacs. me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know jack or shit about flowers. but the way she talked about how much she loved them i knew i didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. so i wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (think what cops use to take notes.) this was the almanacs genesis. over the years i've written down information about my wife. her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. basically all the little things i knew i would forget. anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. i would go through it every once in a while so i could do something sweet for her. fast forward to yesterday morning.
i get a call from her around 11am. ""what the fuck is the almanac?"" (the almanac is written on the cover. it's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) she obviously has it, and i don't lie to my wife, so i tell her. she gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""i always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. i get home from work last night and she's really dejected. i asked her what's wrong and she says the almanac has cheapened every sweet thing i've ever done for her. she called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. mind you i've never showed it to a single soul nor have i even told anyone about it. until yesterday i was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (she also said she hasn't decided if i can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) i'm kind of heart broken. i feel like this should be an example of how much i love her. i'm terrified she's going to burn it. i want to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. that's why i write them down. i don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. i do it because i love my wife. i hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and i don't want to be that guy. so yeah, i took notes. and now i'm getting the silent treatment. or at best single word answers.

thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

a long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. no one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. i told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). so the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

"son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts. this has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. we sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. his allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

we had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. we even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

so we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and i can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. he continued to adamantly deny doing that and said mrs gave them to him. 

we then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? he's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""do not worry! this won't happen again"". we have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

then, the very next school day (the meeting was on friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. we figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. we send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. we get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? he should have known to ask to begin with. we are teachers not parents.""

we have no issues for a while until this week. some parent brought in pb&j sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. he forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". we find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. he was not given this one. we spent a day at the hospital.

we've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? the school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. he gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. this is in indiana, any help is appreciated.",2

"my f28 mil won't take my kid's 4 anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously **update at bottom of post.**

i'll try to keep this as short as possible. sorry for mobile formatting. i've never really seen eye-to-eye with my mil because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... i understand that children need discipline, but i prefer a gentler approach with my son. i've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists i let it go, so i've tried to. 

until now. my son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. she insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that i'm just babying him. i've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

she has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. i told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying i accused her of being an unfit grandmother. which i admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

now my husband wants me to apologise to her. he says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that i'm overreacting. i kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is of the essence because it happens so quickly. 

so, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

she's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a lot of peanuts, everywhere. i asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

i'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a mama's boy who thinks mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. he says he turned out just fine being raised by her and i worry too much. 

would it be awful if i insist she only see him if i'm present? am i completely unreasonable and overreacting? is there anything else i can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**edit/mini-update**: first of all, woah. i did not expect this to get so much attention. thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. in case you missed it: i've left for now, removed my son from the situation, and i'm now currently staying at my brother's house. at least for a few days until things cool off and i'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. in the mean time, i've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. my husband has been to the same appointments i have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

some people have accused me of being a helicopter mom, or trying to demonize my mil. and given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe i'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then i'm okay. i'm not even a sahm, we have an incredible nanny while i work ft, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. in the past, i've tried my best for my mil to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, i've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. but i'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

lastly, i just want to say my mil has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. she won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. so, i don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. she's very strong in her beliefs. i did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. my husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so i told him to find time or he won't be getting any time with my son until he does. if he's going to be so careless, i'll end up dealing with this legally. 

thanks again everyone. words can't express my gratitude. i will update with a new thread eventually.",8

"i (36m) think my wife of 8 years (31f) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42m) throw away for obvious reasons.

so my wife and i have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  at first it's good and we start communicating better.  

about three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". alone.

around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

she starts telling her friends about ""danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which i think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""dr. soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""danny"".  (i don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and i were intimate.

there have been a couple of other weird coincidences that i thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  she went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  it was about 9;30 at night and that seemed really odd to me.

about a half hour later i tracked her iphone and the location showed up as his office.

when she came home 3 hours later, i asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

i think i'm going to confront them in the session this thursday.",8
"i said no to my gf's proposal. warning: this is a long one. scroll down to the tl;dr if you don't want the full story. 

yeah... i f***ed up today. see, i've been dating my gf (k) for 5 years. we are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. i've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. the reason i haven't is that about 2 years ago, i got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

it's been very rough on the two of us, but k has stuck with  me every step of the way. my disease, gpa, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. i'm starting drugs that haven't been fda approved for my condition. all other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. this new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. i'm terrified to say the least. all of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

i want to be healthy and stable before i even think about marriage. i don't want to leave k as a widow with no support! k & i had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that i needed to go into remission first. we agreed to it, or so i thought. flash foreword to a few hours ago and k is with my family in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

i saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. i immediately started freaking out. first thought: i haven't even gone into remission yet and i have no clue if i'm going to get better. i cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. what if i die from all of this? second thought: goddamn it dad! why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

i guess i'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my dad was a very involved parent when i was young. when i entered high-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. the expectations would get so high that i couldn't live up to them. similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. both my brothers and i find this to be a real problem, if my dad is left unchecked. i would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. back to the story!

anyway, i'm freaking out. i just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" with my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, i ran out of the building... i made the love of my life cry as i selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. i've never felt so ashamed in my life... after calming down, i talked to my mother, and drove back to talk to k.

in the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. tears were shed and things were said. k told me i was being selfish. ""we've been dating for years, who cares if you die, i want to marry you!"" she also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. she understood why i would be paranoid about my dad though. k understands that my dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

in the end, we reconciled. we made up, decided that i was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. we came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. we want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

now i'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if i do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, i'll be with my best friend/lover. k is my world, and i'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

thanks for listening.



tl;dr
i said no when my gf proposed bc i'm on chemo and don't know if i'm gonna go into remission or die. decided i was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.

"my husband has sex with me while i sleep wth? ive been married 5 years,  the sex is good and usually regular (providing we're not fighting) but my husband has been having sex with me while i'm asleep. i know it sounds crazy! im a very heavy sleeper and he's taking advantage of it. on a few occasions i've awoke to him fingering me and about to put it in, if he knows i'm waking up, he stops. i am all for being woke up for sex but what is driving me crazy is that he stops every time and pretends like he isn't doing anything. i hate sleeping in clothes, i'm a naked sleeper but i don't think that is an open invitation right?

 last weekend, i woke up again to him trying to get his dick in me, he froze until i acted like i was still asleep, i wanted to see how far this was going to go.  i pretended to sleep and wake up 3 different times, everytime i ""woke up"" he pulled out, heart racing and held me in position real tight until i fell back asleep,  finally he finished all over me and went to get up to get a towel and i said.... was that good for you? he tried to act like he was asleep!!! i told him i was awake the whole time and asked why he did that and why he thought it was okay. his answer...i was horny, it wont happen again. 

fast forward a week...i haven't been talking to him all week. i go to bed with clothes on all week because the thought of him doing it again just disgust me. i confront him about it, he acts like it's no big deal, i'm his wife so it should be fine, he wouldn't care if i did that to him and when i asked why he stopped when i woke up he says because he knew i'd be mad, he didnt want to get caught. i am trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. i'm pretty open minded, if it was a fettish or something, maybe i could be ok with it but he will not give me anything. 

at this point in feel like i can't trust  him anymore and i don't know what to do. has anyone else ever dealt with this? do you think i should believe him? he is only admitting to doing it this 1 time even though i've told him i've caught him before.

"for skipping my child's birth to see my dying father? i had to make the hardest decision of my life a week ago and i want some judgment to see if i made the right decision so please don't remove and say it needs to go tinto another subreddit cuz i'll post there too

&#x200b;

my wife went into labor a few weeks earlier then expected and she ended up giving birth at the hospital. the day it happened she told me that she was in the hospital and needed me however i had just left the house an half hour prior to go see my father who was likely about to die (he did a few hours after i arrived). i decided to see my father one last time and i felt like it was more important than seeing my child's birth because i will raise him and see him everyday for the next 18+ years and i really need to say some things to my father before he dies. my wife and the rest of her family are fucking pissed at me and said that birth is one of the most important parts of our lives and i needed to be there to support my wife and see the child. obviously i didn't want this shit to happen but i felt seeing my father for the last time was important especially since i hadn't seen him in weeks and we weren't on good terms then which we eventually resolved thankfully. if you'd like to provide any advice you're welcome to as i could use some but i'm mainly here for judgment

"a bartender tipped himself $5,000 on my debit card and my local police told me i'm not allow to press charges as long as they're willing to give it back. basically a bartender gave himself a nice tip on my debit card after only spending about $30 on a few drinks. my account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


i went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. he said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. i get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but i said i still wanted to press charges. the officer said i literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

so i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

i was refunded the 5k to my account, but now i have a shit load of overdraft fees because i use paypal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, hbo, etc.) every time paypal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. i've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but i only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. i do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and i can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. every time i check my account, it's just further in the negative and i don't know what to do.

"by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway. yesterday i got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. i squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. i notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where i'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. he looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. as a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

though i couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so i decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. as i sat down i thanked him for making room and told him i really appreciated the gesture. we high-fived and in hindsight i should have ended it there.

i noticed he had his backpack with him so i asked how school was that day. he told me it was just alright. then i asked the fatal question, ""do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" he let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. she yelled ""oooo boy!! you told me you finished that yesterday! guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! you, ya little liar!!!"" his head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

a few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. he looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, i thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" his look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days.

"my family is abusive and i want to emancipate myself i'm a 16 year old girl. i live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. my maternal grandfather also stays with us. my parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - i was in the car but i survived - and i was taken in by my maternal aunt. my dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

the last two years have been hell for me. not only because i still can't get over losing my parents (i cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. my mom was actually estranged from her family. she was white, and my dad was black. her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. they have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and i guess i'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

they have told me just that on several occasions. that my existence is a mistake. i get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. and i'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. sometimes it gets physical. sometimes it feels like i'm trapped in a minefield. i have to be so careful about where i step cause the repercussions may be explosive. my ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. he has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

i can't live like this anymore. i'm an absolute emotional mess. i wanna emancipate myself but i don't know how to go about it. i know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 i'm close with a set of twins at school - i'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. their parents own a farm and i work regularly with the family. i'm also into photography and i've been doing real good with shooting weddings. they are very lucrative and i've saved up a substantial amount. with summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but i also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

the parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. i've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. i don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

i would really appreciate advice.

thank you

"by making a grown man cry at my work i debated whether or not this belongs here cause it's more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. but my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

sidenote: this happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

i work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. i had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. he was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes i get who tend to speak down to me just because i'm a girl who works in a hardware store. anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so i said i could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. he agrees and he opens his wallet and i notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. trying to make conversation i decide to comment on it:
(op: me | og: old guy)

op: oh is that your granddaughter? she's so cute!

og: oh no... that's my daughter.

*fuck, i basically just implied this guy was old.*

og: oh cool! she's really cute! what grade is she in?

*guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

og: she's dead. she was hit by a car. a week after the picture was taken 

in my mind i fucking panicked. i literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. and this is what i came up with:

op: oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! it's too bad she died!

the guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. in record time i get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""have a nice day!"" and he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

guys. 

i told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

and that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" that's what my fucking brain came up with. 
fml.

tl;dr - subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**update: holy shit.**

i did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

to answer a few comments: 
*why didn't you just say 'i'm sorry' and move on?*

because that would of been the smart thing to say and as i have referenced, i am a complete and utter dumbass. also, i am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so i was trying to backpeddle as fast as i could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*why would you comment on the kids picture? that's weird.*

yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. but like i said i am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. this happened when i was still pretty new to the job and i had never worked in retail before so i wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. after this happened i learned my lesson and i have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*why do you work in customer service? you clearly don't belong in that department.*

like i said this happened a few years ago when i was still pretty new and i have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. i now train people for the job and i am also a assistant supervisor of the department. i usually tell newbies this story when i am training them so they don't make the same mistake as i did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*did you ever apologize to the guy?*

no, and that's the one thing i regret most of all. i've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. i truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. while i'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

hello everyone, i said that i'd post an update, in large part due to the massive response i got yesterday. in many ways, i was only posting to repeat the situation in my head, but i found many great pieces of advice in there and support as well. thanks to everyone who posted. 

&#x200b;

i spent last night at my mates, who was absolutely sound about the situation. he basically gave advice that was tantamount to what was given in the comments, to call off the relationship. we had a few drinks, a bit of banter, and this morning i went back to the flat and confronted her. she was there (neither i nor her work on saturdays), and i set out my stake in as straight-forward a manner i could.

&#x200b;

 basically, i said that i didn't want to continue with the relationship, and that its better if we call the whole thing off. the wedding details are merely financial, and not too bad to call back, but at this rate we couldn't continue to be together as we clearly desired different things. she basically expressed what she felt then; that we still had a chance, that it could work, to give ""sexual freedom a chance"". look, i'm no crazy prude, but this shit just isn't up my alley at all. i basically said that over the weekend i'd be over to collect my things (its rented flat in a town, no big obligation there), and that she can keep the place if she wants (i'll stay with my friend for a while, get myself sorted after) . towards the end we had a full blown shouting argument, but i stood my ground and didn't change my course. not this time boys and girls. 

&#x200b;

i left, and there is nothing much more to say really. as i type me and my mate are having a few cans, and my phone has been exploding since 5 o'clock with her friends, her sister calling me a prick and a sexist (for some reason). i'll be grand, being totally frank i feel a bet liberated (if thats not too cheesy).  the coming days i'll get everything sorted, the moving and that, but as my father used to say, ""theres always fucking worse"".

"for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them? i (23m) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

now one of the housemates, we'll call cliff (23m). i call him cliff because he reminds me heavily of brad pitt's character in once upon a time in hollywood. cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and pretty much the poster boy for ""strong silent type"". he doesn't talk much and is mysterious, but he's also very confident. 

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

now the three girls i live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

"i build my (26m) relationship on a lie and i dont know how to tell my gf (24f) or what to do  i met my gf on tinder and she had a picture with a dog so, of course, i commented on it as i broke the ice. we talked a bit and she turned out to love dogs and i just said that yeah, dogs are great, because she seemed sweet and cute and i wanted a date.

things progressed but we never met in her place because she had 2 roommates who acted like bunnies (if you know what i mean) so we usually would hang out at my place. i only really saw her dog when i was picking her up and i would never come in so i had no interaction with it.

thing is she moved out to her own place last week. she now wants to hang out at her place. i would be very happy but her dog will be there too and...

i am really, really afraid of dogs. i know i should've been honest from the get go but back then it seemed like such a small thing to lie about. i mean, how many tinder dates go beyond a hookup? and then the more time passed the more embarassed i felt. especially since she would say that her dog breed gets so much bad rep by ignorant people and i just... how can i tell her i'm one of those people? except i'm afraid of all dogs, not only hers so really it is worse?

how do i fix this? i don't want our relationship to end because i can't man up and just act like a normal person when i'm in a room with a friendly dog... i fucked up and i dont even know what to do here",8

"my favorite joke: everyone knows dave dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""you know, i know everyone there is to know. just name someone, anyone, and i know them.""

tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""ok, dave, how about tom cruise?""

""no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it.""
so dave and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,

 ""dave! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!""

although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.

""no, no, just name anyone else,"" dave says.

""president obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""yup,"" dave says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go. 

at the white house, obama spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""pope francis,"" his boss replies.

""sure!"" says dave. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.

dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope.""
he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.

sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, ""what happened?""

his boss looks up and says, ""it was the final straw... you and the pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with dave?'",0

"in general, women are grosser than men. i'm a woman. here's my reasoning.

i worked janitorial jobs for almost 10 years, in various settings. banks, doctor's offices, businesses, gas stations, etc. the women's restroom was always, 100% of the time, nastier. things in the toilet i can't even begin to describe. toilet paper everywhere. poop on the walls and the seats. spit and make up on the mirrors. and blood on everything. all the time.

in ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing i saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. i worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. and had money, and the women destroyed their bathrooms. sometimes i wasn't even sure the things i saw, came out of humans.

secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms i've been in, were women's. in female friends homes i've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

i've never seen worse than dirty clothes on a man's bedroom floor.

women are far nastier than men.",6
"update nc sold them a used car, now they sued me. a lot of stress was lifted from our shoulders today, thankfully. 

original post here(https://amp.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b2mi6a/nc_sold_them_a_used_car_now_they_sued_me_over_it/)

this morning we had our court date, and let me tell you it was pretty quick. got in at 8:32, out by 8:50. the plaintiff presented her case, in which she said that we hadn't disclosed an airbag light that was on the dash, and that the check engine light code we told them about was false information because it actually turned out to be another issue. said the vehicle had more rust than they originally knew about, and that they hadn't driven it because a mechanic told them it was unsafe to drive. 

we presented our defense, clearly stating they had the opportunity to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic, but chose to take our word for it; and that we brought all known faults to their attention prior to selling them the vehicle. anything they found after they took ownership wasn't our issue anymore, they had all chances to make a proper decision prior. we brought up the ftc's private sale guide stating that all cars sold from private party to private party are ""as-is"" unless otherwise stated. we neither expressed nor implied any warranties. 

long story short, the magistrate dismissed the case with prejudice to the plaintiff  because nc is a ""buyer beware state"" and the buyer should have done all in their power to make an informed decision before purchasing the vehicle. they have 10 days to appeal, but i doubt that's gonna happen. 

thanks to everyone that commented and gave my wife and i more information on the original post. it sure helped!

tl;dr: magistrate heard the case, dismissed it because the buyer should have done more to inspect the vehicle.

"for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister? i found out i was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. when i told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if i had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. i was already living independently, both my boyfriend and i worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. in our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so i thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

during my pregnancy i asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when i started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when i wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when i was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. they refused, telling me that i was expecting to be catered to. they also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that i was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that i was making dumb decisions"". when i spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that i was trying to get gifts from them. i had severe post-partum depression and thought i was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. my relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. they told me they were afraid i was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

which brings us to today, 3 years later. my sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than i did when i was treated ""as an independent adult"". our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff i have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. i answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. i've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

"by deleting reddit's #1 top post of all time happened just now. sorry for my possible slips as english is not my mothertongue. i mostly only lurk around, but this time i decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

i've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. usually when i get depressed at home i start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because i like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

see, since i'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""accounts"" folder and terminating the ones i don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). the thing is i used to have an imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so i decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since i didn't get it by registering at the service directly. i'll omit the details of all the cyber sex i went through with my keyboard and the browser, but i somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so i pretty much forgot about the whole deal. but little did i know.

later in the day i get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. in addition to that i still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. being the total jackass of an idiot that i am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, i decide to google the #1 top reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on imgur (yeah, the one about the senate, with a total of whole damn 310k updoots). i open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise satan himself. of course imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? it can't be this bugged, right? (i hadn't clicked one by then yet). so i click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this tifu.

i'm sorry. i didn't want to. please, forgive me everyone.
i'll commit sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.

"my husband put his dick in my cup of water, and didn't tell me. okay, this is not a shitpost. i wish it was. i'm deeply disturbed. 

the other night after sex, as my husband and i were getting up and dressed, i asked if he could grab me a glass of ice water. he was on his way out of the room, and said sure. he wasn't mad about it, and sex was fine. we weren't fighting and had been having a pretty good week. 

as i walk into the kitchen he hands me the glass of water. 

i don't know what came over me, but i got this sixth sense, i don't know how else to describe it. maybe it was his shiteating grin, but i flat out asked him, did you put your dick in this?

he looked shocked and taken aback by my question and for a split second i thought maybe i was being an idiot. 

he then says, how did you know?!?!

i was furious but it was such a strange situation so i just dumped it out and brushed it off. i didn't know what else to do. 

the next day i asked him about it, and i asked why he did it. he said, i don't know.  

i told him that it kind of made me upset, like i can't trust him to get me a glass of water. it hurt my feelings. he immediately got defensive. 

we got into a fight about trust and he didn't understand what the big deal was. i said, so what? do you put my toothbrush in the toilet when we fight??

he said no of course not, but he had that same shiteating grin. 

i don't know if he'd ever do that, and maybe it was just the way i phrased it or that the fight was about him putting his dick in my glass of water. but, like wtf?

i don't know what to think. 

am i overreacting?

edit:

for those asking, we've been married almost 10 years now. he's 34, i'm 32. 

honestly i didn't expect for this to blow up. i wrote a quick post and went to bed.

thank you to everyone responding/giving advice and input, i'm trying to respond to as much as i can. 

here's my takeaway: 

some people, mostly men, are saying it was just a practical joke or a prank.

but here's the thing, he didn't mean for me to find out. i asked him straight up and he told that he wasn't going to say anything. no harm done! that he thought it was funny and that he didn't know why he did it. he just did. 

so to me, it wasn't done in a joking manner. 

after thinking about it, it's more of a consent issue. to those asking, sure we just had sex and yes i suck his dick sometimes...but this is different. he violated boundaries and i feel upset about that.

update:

whether we can all agree to disagree about it being a joke or not, it was disgusting, disrespectful and crossed a line.

i'm going to talk to him later about boundaries and what not.",8
"i 26m upset a woman 20sf and my friends are acting like i'm in the wrong. hey guys.

i went out clubbing last night with my friends. there were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. my girlfriend hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. i offered to stay in with her but she insisted i go out and have a good time. 

at the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. they were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

one of them, lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. she was pretty but i was not interested as i have a girlfriend. i told her this but she then started asking for pics of hannah. i showed her and she said that i ''could do better than that''. i was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

later me and my friends were dancing, and lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. i gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. a while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. she smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. i was absolutely fuming and in response i poured my beer on her head. she started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. i understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like i was wrong to pour my drink on her. they all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

the ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when i pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

nobody said goodbye to me last night and i made my own way home. i told hannah what happened and she agrees that i didn't do anything wrong. i tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

how do i sort this out in a mature way?

tl;dr: my friends are acting like i was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",8

"for telling my mom she's the reason i don't want any kids? i (23f) am the oldest of 4 siblings. my dad passed away when i was 14, leaving us and my mom. 

there's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. so when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. if i had to guess i'd say i spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. plus an hour or so on chores. 

now i love my siblings, and i love my mom. but from when i was 14 till i moved out at 19 i had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. all there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

i'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. i've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. i've politely told her i don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

when she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after i told her to stop asking) i told her ""giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" i didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

she cried. i told her i don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. i didn't apologise. 

aita?

edit: when i said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" i wasn't trying to be malicious. 
a) she at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why i had to. 
b) i called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, i had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

i wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why i said it that way.

edit 2: yes, i'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. i was there. i never said i don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. i'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and i don't want kids because of that.

edit 3: for the people pming and commenting about how it's my fault i didn't have friends and not my mom's: i wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

last edit: for everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

\- the other thing is: i have to admit that this post was rushed. and yes, i am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). the funny thing is that while i might think some commenters are oversensitive i have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and i can also get oversensitive. i don't regret what i wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. some of you made the assumption that i must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. that's right. and sometimes i turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw i'm female for those who thought otherwise). the reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. i can understand that what i said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). and at the end i'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. i should have considered more factors. i want to apologize about that honestly. so thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now i'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. i'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. so thank you for offering the experience. i appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. i'll try and digest them properly in the following days. i'm still think that i'm right about some aspects but not anymore do i believe my reasoning is flawless. i wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**content:**

honesty is not kindness. honesty is honesty. period. i don't mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn't put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. you can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. if you can't take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. and yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

you can't just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ""soft"") - and how you react to that is your responsibility. the partner doesn't have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it's a sensitive topic to you. i wonder why it's so sensitive…

looks does matter. we have a right to voice what we like and by putting away our own ego we should be more flexible dealing with and communicating it.",6

six years ago, it came out during couple's therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. my mom initiated divorce. six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. my dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day i can truly forgive him.

i do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father's wife, i begrudgingly show respect. i have never called her out of her name until later in this story. if she speaks to me, i will say something back. if i am in her home, i will clean up after myself. however, i will always refer to her as my father's wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. this is something she cannot accept.

i have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. while at my father' house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying ""the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,"" and said that i was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why i would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. i guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

she then revealed that when my dad gets back from his tdy (temporary duty assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say ""don't mess with her,"" with her 2-month-old daughter. i have never been in any of the previous family portraits because i refused to and my dad said i didn't have to.

i told her i was not going to participate

she asked why i was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

six years' worth of hurt came out. i told her she was a fool to ever think i was her child or that i considered her family. from my perspective, she was nothing, but my father's racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. i took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn't my father's child because she looks nothing like him.

she turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful i was and i had no right to talk to her in such a manner. i fully admit i called her a bitch and stated she didn't even deserve any respect from me because she didn't respect my mother's marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. after realizing what i had said, i left and haven't talked to her since.

everyone that i have talked to say i should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and i don't mind doing that.  however, certain people say i shouldn't have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

so who is the asshole?",3
"by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm. i'm in my third year of university taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. to start the semester i ended up missing the first week of school because i was on a last minute trip with my friends. it was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since i technically couldn't afford to go.

anyway, i came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. on both those days i have classes all day until 2pm so i usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. so my first tuesday home i ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. so as part of my degree i have to take microeconomics which all i knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. when i get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so i just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

this goes on for 3.5 weeks. i came to class. took notes. then did the weekly assignments. on the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is febuary 1st. so the class before the exam, january 30th, i decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. now i was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was all theory based while the class was heavy math based. i understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. i explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*explains above about material*
prof: ""what do you mean theory? all the assignments are filled with math. are you using launchpad?""
me: ""no the assignments are online. like the website we bought the textbook from. whats lauchpad?""
prof: ""pardon? i don't have a textbook for this course.""
me: ""it literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*shows syllabus*
prof: ""wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
me: ""what do you mean...? this is econ 202 right?""
*prof starts laughing*
prof: ""haha this is econ 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. this is a new one, i've never experienced this before.""
me: ""well this is awkward. i better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

i then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. i caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. even showed him my econ 301 notes to prove i couldn't make this shit up. he just laughed and said the same thing ""this is a new one for me."" turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. same with the midterms. they were relevant because it was obviously a level above what i was supposed to be doing and the only thing i got wrong was the building code. they were both classroom 112, just different buildings. so basically i just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. wish me luck tomorrow!

tldr; i was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until i finally realized. then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. crazy coicidences all around.

edit: well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""you made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". the exam is in a couple hours and i will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but i had fun and went to tiesto's birthday in vegas amongst other kool stuff. life goes on.

2. i was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and i had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). so i do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. he did everything on the board and there were online notes but i figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. i highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. it's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. i've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so i'm sure it will turn out fine. it'll be a funny story at grad when i get my ring.

thanks for all the support too. :) making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

edit 2: just got back from the exam.. i didn't crush it but there is no way i didn't pass. it was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. the prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""i usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm i will take the average to make up that first exam."" so all in all i survived and live to fight another day.

just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. i will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. in the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. but somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - cz

"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house? so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"by chuckling away being overpaid. obligatory ""this concluded today"" - i've been working for uncle sam for about 7 years now. i'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day i received a letter from dfas (the guys who actually pay us) that i was overpaid two whole cents.

silly i thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which i could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, the man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - it was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

laughing it off i taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom i work for and why i should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you f-35), and forgot about it. a month later, two weeks ago i get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address xxxxx, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

now i'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before i ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now i'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. being the class a humorous guy that i am, i send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, i kunted et al myself. i lobe me job."" covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

this was a bad play because apparently feds have no sense of humor.

"for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment? i have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only i can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. all the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but i told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

things worked pretty well at first but over time i caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. after the third or so time i sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. they all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and i told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

i came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. i see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead i just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. after this during the middle of the night i took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. it took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. queue bitching. queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". i don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. i'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when i regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think i'm an ass for good now and i had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

"once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... 

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note.  people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  words cannot do justice to the experience.  the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday.  all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note.  from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted!  the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  soon the entire monastery was aflame.  by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

"by shaving my butthole before a first date. edit1: technically ""trimmed"" not ""shaved""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

so the happened last night, but this requires some background explanation...

this is gonna be tmi, but that's kinda the nature of tifu, so whatever. i'm a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. i also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and i don't know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (aka the taco bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it ain't fun. so i had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. so i trimmed it off at night, added some aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. win-win!

fast forward two days, and i'm going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she's like the best looking girl i've dated, so i wanna shell out the monies of course. dinner went pretty well, and we got coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren't home) for a movie. turns out they aren't home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.

but, guys, i can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  we're sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and i just had to let one out. i'm usually pretty good at silent farts, so i'm not paying attention to the fact that we're in a quiet spot in the movie. and this fart was not silent! it was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart i've ever had in my entire life, hands down. i was mortified. she immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and i of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. she did not laugh with me...no text-backs so far.

i googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. so a little there for you inside this tifu. just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so i can go on dates again.

"update to: i found out i have a daughter who thinks i was her mother's rapist. it wasn't rape. what next? ten days ago i requested advice and the post got removed after a day because i didn't use a throwra.  i'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. i alerted the moderators i would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

original

i received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a dna match and she is my biological daughter. it was a long and emotionally charged letter. she said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish i had caused her and her mother and grandparents. the letter was gut wrenching.

i was shocked but also skeptical. i have been married 25 years and i have three great kids. i have never raped or abused a woman ever! i thought this had to be a prank or scam. i had done home dna ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child i wasn't aware of. but when i logged into my account, there she was.

i did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, terry (fake name), i had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  we broke it off mutually and remained friendly. the very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. it was a casual hookup and i remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. also unprotected. afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. we both went home the next morning for summer break. terry didn't come back to college the next year, which i gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

one of the reasons terry and i were incompatible was religion. she was catholic and i'm jewish. i was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. my supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a jewish ex-boyfriend. but who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

it kills me that i have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. i can't imagine growing up thinking i was a product of rape. that has to be so hard psychologically. i am in pain for a child i didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

i have been debating what to do. i have not written back to my daughter. i badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). my wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. my best friend says i should hire a lawyer. i don't know what to do and it's eating me up. advice, please!

update

i hired a lawyer. he recommended that i respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. i wrote her a short message and described how and when terry and i met. i was careful not to attack terry and to offer sympathy. i explained that our sex was consensual. a week went by with no response.

two days ago my daughter wrote me and said terry now claims she was raped a month after she and i had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. she's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. i find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not i guess it gives terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

yesterday i spoke to my daughter for the first time. she was crying and so was i, so it wasn't easy to say much. before we hung up, i told her that i loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and i hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. she sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

my wife and i told our kids about a week ago. they are teenagers and took it really well. all three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. my wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. she has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. my daughter is going to call me again tonight and i'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. we have a lifetime of catching up to do.

meantime as for terry, i feel like my daughter and i were robbed, but i really don't want to dwell on it. she hasn't reached out to me and i don't plan to either, though i'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.

"schools should not punish bullied kids for fighting back. if a kid gets physically hurt by a bully, i believe defending oneself should be allowed, since a slap on the wrist/detention will do almost nothing to make the bully ""see the light"" in his wrongdoings. a lot of people tend to disagree with this calling it barbaric, but why should a provoked kid who kept to himself be punished if he's reacting to what happened? also, the school's way of punishing a bully tends to be very counterproductive in general.

"for getting upset that my sister's fiance pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding? the title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

i'm 24 and i'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

i used and used until i was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

she's my best friend and i know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

she also met her fiance two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. he's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much i put my sister through. 

despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because i am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

when i get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

when i walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure i ""didn't bring anything in"".  i instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't i, and i tell him not to touch me. 

he tells me to ""calm down"" and that if i want to be here then he needs to do this. i tell him he's being ridiculous and i try to push past him. he stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" i told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

at this point i'm getting more and more angry and i'm practically yelling in his face at this point. bystanders came between us and separated us and told my bil to just ""drop it."" he said he would but that ""they can deal with it when i get out of hand.""

i just went to go find a seat after that. 

after the reception, a lot of my family told me that i should've let him just do it and that i was acting like a huge asshole and like i had ""something to hide."" 

i don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and i don't think my reaction was over the top. if anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. my sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"if i back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? best man is my ex fiance who cheated on me and i can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him. jump into the worst week of my life. i was with my ex fiance for 6 years. loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for august. refused a job offer so could move with him for his next air force assignment. monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) i text back she must have wrong number. she says she doesn't. in a moment of brains i pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. i'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

i confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. i consider it for half a second and say no. cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of std tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who i loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

and on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

i've never hated a human being as much as i hate him. i can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. i understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because i'm upset. so i just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit.

edit 2: ok guys i don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or nta and said i should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. i'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when i get sad i have an instant reminder of who he really is. and then when it's all over i'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. if i can update a week from now i will. i still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.


edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys i've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3am last  monday (or tuesday, or whatever). i have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. that just isn't the case, at all. i love her as much as i love any person on the planet and she has my back. but this wedding is now a week away. it's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fiance not to come. everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. my ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. he's as close with the groom as i am with her. if they make big changes now then the day becomes about what he did, not about the wedding. it's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like i said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. if i bring that up then this whole week becomes about that. my best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. they didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. my friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fiance to walk in with other people or even separately, but i'm not going to do that. first of all because i think it will look weird. and secondly i foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him one last time--forever and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come august but he fucked it up.",3

"every year my wife has spent upwards of $1500 on new xmas decorations she just throws away after new years. she promised me last year was the last but i just found a huge bag of decorations in the garage. i'm disgusted. what do i do here? (both 34, two kids) wife and i have been married 10 years, we have two kids 5 and 3. wife is a good person but has no concept of money, budgeting and spending. i've gotten her following a pretty decent budget but she comes and blows her was during xmas. 

i don't mind her being generous to friends and family. it brings her joy and i appreciate that. but what disgusts me is her ""need"" to spend money to decorate. every single year she goes completely overboard and essentially buys an entire brand new set of christmas decorations. everything from tree holders to candle stands to ornaments. every year it's all brand new and every year she's so exhausted by the end of the holiday to store and organize it all that she just throws it all away.

to best exemplify how it works let's talk about stockings. she will go to target, see cute stockings buy four of them. then she'll go to world market and see even cuter stockings and she'll buy four of them there. then she'll see one at walmart which features lighting mcqueen for my son and buy it and buy one for my daughter to be fair. so we'll have 10 new stockings for xmas and all of them will be thrown in the garbage on january 2nd. the rub is my grandma hand made stockings for the entire family, so we don't even need any, let alone 10. replace stockings with any other xmas item and that's how it goes until we have $1500 at least in credit card bills for stuff that's just going in the garbage.

last year we couldn't afford it all so we ended up paying interest until about april on her xmas purchases. i told her enough was enough and frankly i'm also sick of the amount of junk that were just sending to the land fill. we went over all the decorations we already have and how we could just use those. she agreed.

however i was getting ready for work (i work extra saturday shifts in novmeber and december to afford the holidays, another post i guess) and found two huge bags of all brand new xmas decorations hidden in the garage. i would guess it's $300-$500 worth of stuff. i'm so disgusted i can hardly see straight. 

i'm up at 4:30 on a saturday to work my ass off for stuff that were going to pay interest on that is going to give us 20 minutes of joy that will rot in the landfill. i feel exhausted and just want to get into bed and tell her to go work. 

what do i do here? sitting in my truck really fighting the urge to go grab the kids and move into my moms house until we get to some resolution here.

let's see... her problem is that she overspends, exhausts herself, runs out of spoons, and tosses the decor rather than go through the huge and delicate storage game. hey! you live there too. you get to enjoy her cooking, her decorating, her throwing parties for your friends and your family, she does the family gift shopping, sends out the cards, plans the parties, cleans up after the parties... and you? you bitch because at the end of all this emotional and physical and executive work, she's too fucking tired to carry in and organize all the deco boxes, carefully wrap each ornament, nestle it into another tissue cradle she makes, carry out the full boxes and find somewhere to put them where your untended crap overflows the shelves and leaves her with the job of reorganizing the entire place to jenga everything together. but you'll sit on your butt and bitch without lifting a hand. hey, i've got an idea, mr. man. get on your tiny snowflake feet and put the fucking decorations away. then there they are, next year. her? she's fucking tired after bringing you, the children and everyone else a nice holiday. or ask for a bouncy seat this christmas, so that you can watch her struggle while laying back and sucking on a bottle.",8

"my ex proposed. i said no. he is now talking about suing me. advice? just want to say this is going to sound insane but i am not trolling/making it up.

me and this guy were together for 3 years. we're 19 now. we never talked about the future until a year in. before then i'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

in short, i wanted kids, he didn't. i wanted to stay in ireland, he didn't. i wanted to get married, he didn't. when i realised it was a bad match i broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. this happened a few times over the next 18 months in this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

we knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something i would want further down the line, i wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. if i were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then i might have an issue, but when i'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

when i went to see him this time i was again, considering breaking up with him. aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that i really don't like. so when i arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, i assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so i wouldn't cause a scene. i don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

in the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. first he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff i liked and what my taste was. i assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so i told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. i also said ""go cheap"".

the other thing he asked me was how i felt about public proposals. i told him immediately that i, personally, disliked them as i felt i wouldn't be able to say no, even if i wanted to. i feel like public proposals are ok when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not ok at all. i assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

i never thought in a million years that he would propose.

so you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

the ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. he got on one knee, and held it out to me. we were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

i said no.

well, i didn't so much say ""no"". i ran out of the restaurant.

he drove me there, so i got a cab back, and drove home that night.

i realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but i didn't know what else to do. i could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all i knew was that i didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. i felt like i couldn't even speak, i was so upset about the whole thing. so i just got up and ran.

i just want to take the opportunity to say here that i really really don't care about the rings. honestly, when i want to get married (which is absolutely not when i'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and i'd say yes. i wouldn't even need a ring. i know i'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what i'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

i didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. he said that he thought a proposal was something i'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. he said that he was out of pocket for the rings. he'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. he linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). when i asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped i would cover the cost of mine. he said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. he'd hoped that i would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but i said no. he also said i'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if i was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

we both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on sunday.

he has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that i have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which i had no part in spreading. he says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. so €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

i think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but i am not a law student or a lawyer. he is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

what do i do about all of this? do i need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

thanks in advance :)

edit:  he knew i wanted to get married but not to him. he not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. he openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and i told him that this was why i was breaking up with him the times before this that i have ended the relationship. during the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like i'm gonna propose"" (that one was last april)

tldr: my girlfriend was really close with my roommate, i suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

basically, after i kicked my gf out of our party, i assumed we would all lay low for a few days. i was wrong. the day after the party, my roommate (i decided to call him chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but i ignored him. less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing chet couldn't have been avoided, because while i was a good boyfriend, i study and sleep too much. ok. she then told me she would be willing to work through this if i was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. i didn't respond to the text.

that night i had a dinner with my parents i couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. i came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. i figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. wrong. i noticed later when chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into his room.

i haven't seen either of them, i think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. i don't even know how to feel. honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and i'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",8
"by telling my three year old daughter that i would eat her booty alright so let's start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you'll be like wtf? 

so my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  and more accurately it's more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife ""mommy, get my booty! get my booty mom"" and off to the races they go. 

obviously this is a game that both parents play and she'll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. this get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it's cute and we haven't gotten any feedback on it.

this brings us to last night. the wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells ""get my booty daddy!"" to which i reply nonchalantly ""i'm going to eat your booty! nom nom nom"" since her butt was right next to my face. 

i immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling ""eat my booty daddy! eat my booty"" and takes off running. dear lord, what have i done?! i try to go into damage control and revert back to get your booty, but it's too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

i took her to daycare this morning, i hope she forgot all about it. i'm dreading picking her up.

tl;dr my daughter yells get my booty to initiate games of tag. with her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face i instead say i'm going to eat your booty! she now yells eat my booty to initiate the game instead. 

edit: a word. also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

there were lots of requests for an update after pickup. all is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them.

"for ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name? i've worked at my office for 8 years. i'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. i'm not his supervisor, but i'm definitely a senior employee. i'll call the guy ted faro, because he's a dick.

​

supervisor was going around introducing ted to people, and when he got to me said ""this is john"" and described my job.

​

ted: ""hi, jack.""

me: ""it's john.""

​
ted: ""what?""
​

me: ""my name's john, not jack.""

ted: ""it's close enough for me.""

supervisor: ""his name's john, not jack. let's move on.""

​

this continued for a few months. despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when i wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name jack. i finally told him ""you either use my name, or i ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

his response was ""sure thing, jackie boy.""

​

since i don't work directly with him, i figured ""screw it"" and that i'd ignore him.

​

recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. i work late some nights, and ted came to me and says ""hey, jack, i'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when i get back. see you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

as promised, i ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and i get a call. i recognize his number, so i ignored it. he called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

the first one was along the lines of ""jack i'm at enterprise. come pick me up.""

e-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as jack, jack-o, jackie, and jackie-boy. the emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

i signed out and went home. it was raining hard.

next morning, i saw that ted had sent a few more e-mails. i printed them off. at 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""where the f-bomb were you? i told you when to pick me up! i had to take a cab! do you know how much that cost me?!"" he goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

supervisor: ""ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. he was caught out in the rain.""

​

i relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. i'd highlighted the threats.

supervisor: ""i can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. but it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. that's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""with the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

a few people at the office have commented that i'm the jerk for ignoring ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

i had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but i still swiped out of boredom. they were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. only boob. there was no picture of her husband. i take a few shots and message them.  after like an hour of talking, i decide to just do it. we never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. she wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. at first i was like really not for it, i originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and i was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. at 2am i left the house, and this is where i regret everything.

the husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as i see him, my gut and inner voice are screaming at me, don't do this, turn back. and i wish i had listened. for reasons unknown, i followed him into the house. it was pitch black, not a single light was on. he lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. i was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. if there was ever a time i disassociated, it was then and there. it was no longer me behind the wheel. the dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. does anybody remember the scene in blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? that was what i saw. a disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. i was horrified but at the same time, i didn't care. they both fucking stink, that was one of the worst things. the smell took forever to wash off my hands after. months later i'll get a whiff out of nowhere. that disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

i take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking the entire time, like fucking gollum. saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. look at that beautiful pussy. ain't she so fuckin wet?"" nonstop. meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. like i said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, i managed to perform to a degree but i never did finish. it probably didn't help i was wearing a condom but i'm extremely glad i was. the entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""how the fuck am i getting home? this smell is going to kill me. how do i end this? how do i get out of here?""

i decided it was time, i had to get the fuck out of there asap. i told them i couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. they insisted i put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. i just wanted to make it look like i at least tried. if the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. i pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. i stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. i politely reiterated i wasn't going to be able to finish. i blamed it on my tires being popped and i was too tired. they were cool about it, and i quickly gathered my things and left.

i barely had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. so we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. my hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers i took and how many times i washed them. i blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what i did. it took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200b;

tldr; drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

"for hiding my personal life at work? i'm in a little trouble at work because i've been sort of hiding my personal life. i've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. i'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. with that, i never, ever talk about home life. i'm not ashamed of my life i just don't like to discuss it at work. my coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. if i'm asked any questions i usually redirect or move on to someone else. in this manner, none of my coworkers knew i'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

we hired melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. she spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. however, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. try as she did, i never gave her anything. my coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. compartmentalization aside, i've made some great friendships at work. there are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. they are a big part of my life but i'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. they're hugely important and come before everything else but i'm not a sycophant and i enjoy the ten hours a day i'm at work when i get to be an adult and talk about things other than jojo siwa and the newest jenndashian exploit.

last week, friday, melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. at lunch she announced to everyone that i am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. i play softball, i kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that i'm on facebook. she couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. i use a shortened version of my name (ali from alexandra) and my married name on fb so i'm not sure how she found me, unless she used whitepages and put two and two together. i've already reported her to hr.

but the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a bfd. one of my friends said she's hurt that i don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". i tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, i just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. i never bring work home. when i'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. heck, i chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when i'm not there. i've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. i honestly don't see the problem. i've never lied to them, i've never given them false info, i've never made up wild tales about my life. i'm still the same person i was, now they just know more about me than they did.

eta: i know this has been posted three times today. i didn't know reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and i thought it was the account i was posting from so i created a second throwaway and then a third because i never got confirmation the post was uploaded. i couldn't even get past the white screen with the little reddit face spinning in the center. those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. this one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

eta:  i don't have any sort of interesting update. hr brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us wtf is going on. i presented my side, as detailed above, melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. i asked my hr rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. there were several. then i asked him to search my married name, or the one i go by on fb, ""ali smith"". there were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. in any case, too many to count. i haven't touched my own page since i reported the incident. it was about thirty names from the top but like i said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. i do have an instagram page that's on private but i only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. she found me night before last and friended me. naturally i blocked her. hr gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. my rep wasn't sure why melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called bs on her for claiming it was innocent. so that's that. that's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. however, i took the advice from this sub and i'm making amends. they're all most receptive. i'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. but they know enough about me to know i'm not an automaton or anything.",3

"tifu by having a threesome my girlfriend and i have been together for several months now. we only see each other on weekends due to distance and work schedules, but this last weekend i fucked up. 

her friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. they were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and i was involved. we went to the bed and started fucking, but before i went inside her friend, i looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, ""is this okay?"" 

she said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. after a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

my girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so i thought. i called her the following night cause i felt extremely guilty. she said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. she simply asked that i never do it again. 

come this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends. i absolutely love her so much but i let lust get between us. 

i really fucked up guys..

"my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

i don't really know how to begin so i'm just gonna dive right in. we've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and i have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. this took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. his parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. to the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

the problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. he has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. he talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. cool, i thought. that all sounds beautiful. 

we didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. it was on a day i was working so i couldn't go with him and when i asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. i was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

i did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

it was definitely a shock but i reacted positively and told him it looked really good. it was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

it's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. i can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. bf is super proud of it and i honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

my only issue with it is during sex. 

it takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. it doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo really stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

not to mention this thing is like the mona fu*cken lisa. 

any position that we're facing each other in, i always end up making eye contact with it. and every time i do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. every time. ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, i doubt i would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of any six year old. 

it's honestly ruining our sex life. 

i haven't told my bf any of this because i feel like i can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (i know lasers exist but i doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where i'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried i'm not attracted to him anymore.

i am attracted to him. i'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

what can i do in this situation? the thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. but looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

should i talk to him? am i overreacting? is our sex life officially dead? 

thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- my boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and i can't stop making eye contact with it during sex.

update: this has gotten a lot more attention than i anticipated. some people are saying it's reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. i'm not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. currently debating whether i should just let fate take the wheel on this one. 

otherwise i've received some really phenomenal advice on how i should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward. i was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship-ending issue before i made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through. so thank you so much. 

i'll make a new post to update how things go once i've talked to my bf about all this. if he doesn't see this post first i think i'll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

"people obsessed with sports are just as nerdy as people into video games or dungeons and dragons. title says it pretty well. don't get me wrong i'm a huge sports fan, i like teams in the ncaa, nfl, and mlb. i follow them all very closely. i am a nerd because of that. i sit alone and watch games and yell and carry on, but so many people are in denial about this.

there are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing. that should garner just as much criticism as majoring in psychology, gender studies, and sociology. those degrees are completely useless if you don't get a job like selling tickets for your local college team.

we all know someone who is that ""sports are my life guy"" 

also so many of the people that give people shit calling them losers or nerd for playing things like league of legends or d&d are these sports nerds. there's guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they'd probably give them unrelenting shit.

again nothing wrong with being a sports fan, but let's call a spade a spade. sports fanatics are nerds too, they need to embrace it.

i did what you all told me to do. i wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. i also called them. they said they will speak with the school.

i was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. i did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

i said loudly ""i think you owe me an apology.""

she said ""yes, i should not have accused you of cheating.""

i said ""yes, and another apology for saying i don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

she said ""i'm sorry"" and left.

the principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

i said ""it wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

he apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. i then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

so things are sorted out now. but also, i'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. i only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and i was very pissed off at them. and the counselor had given me horrible advice.

thanks for pointing me in the right direction!",2
"while talking dirty to my gf throwaway for obvious reasons.

so a little background: my current gf and i have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. before her i was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and i'm learning everything for the first time. long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. i said i was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside i knew that i had no idea what i would be doing and would kind of be winging it. last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. so we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. she's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
she kind of rambled for a bit, and i was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. the rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than i normally do. this is all new territory for me, but i'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like christopher columbus, and she's what i think is india. so i decide to talk dirty. her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, i figure this is the perfect time to strike. and that's when i cleverly decided to ask if i make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

her face fell. it's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. i went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. i've been wondering how i could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. we approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. i don't think i'll be redeeming myself anytime soon.

final update:

i first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. i got a lot more responses than i had thought i would, so i apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

my sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on september 1st. it's been a very hard couple of days and i've been grieving, as has my family. 

we were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. i was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. she was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

i wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. she normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. we will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

my family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. she will always be in our hearts and i know she's in a better place and not in pain. 

thank you again to everyone ❤️ it will always mean so much to me and my family for all the thoughts, prayers and advice i was given.",8
"update - my brother went missing 6 years ago. police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? how do we get more information. illinois. https://redd.it/74we5z

i talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. they found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. the officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

there days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed dna samples to confirm. dna confirmed it was him.

what happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). that was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. that's when they decided to... his friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

the officer says my brother didn't die in pain. it was multiple gunshots. you'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. we had a funeral for him. now there's a place that i can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

i thank all of you who helped.

"by putting a 5 hour energy in my vagina 12 hours before my first ""grown up job"" interview, i was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company's grounds. considering i smoke weed daily i started looking up ways to pass a drug test. i came to the conclusion that i was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. i had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they're just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. 

unfortunately i was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time i had to prepare, but knowing that i wouldn't be able to pass if the temperature wasn't correct i had the idea to stick it up my vagina. i tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so i could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.

fast forward to the interview.
it was an hour and a half away so i decided to wait till i got there to insert it. i did it in my car w some coconut oil before i walked in just incase they decided to drug test me first. i walked in and everything was fine, i signed in and they told me to take a seat. as soon as i sat down i knew something was wrong. i went to the bathroom to make sure i could still take it out. i began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn't move. i tugged again and the string broke. at this point i'm freaking out. i try getting it out with my fingers but i can't reach it. the only ""tools"" i have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. so in a 3 piece suit and heels, i squat and begin to use these ""tools"" to try and remove the bottle. about 4 min go by and i'm really freaking out but need to go back incase they called my name. i walk out and the hr rep sees me and asks if i'm okay. i tell her i have a tampon stuck up my vagina that i can't get out and that's why i'm freaking out. she then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, i ask her if i can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. obviously that didn't work. so she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... still didn't work. at this point i just have to do the interview. it lasted 3 hours and i had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. 

when the interview finally ends i rush to the closest urgent care where i have to explain to the doctors why there's a 5 hour energy in my vagina. at this point i'm convinced i just don't have the right tools and they'll get it out in no time. upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it's also sideways. her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle in my vagina and then fish it out. ~luckily~ they just sent me to the er instead. 

so now i'm at the er where they then inform me that since it's behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since i wasn't actually giving birth my body wasn't dilated and they couldn't remove the bottle without putting me under.  

well, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.
i didn't get the job and i didn't even get drug tested. 

tldr: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. after 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the er it was finally removed

edit: this isn't made up. idk if i have all the ""anatomy"" right i guess? yes it was very painful. yes, i have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don't believe me

i'm just telling you guys what the doctors told me. they might have just told me a dumbed down version without the right medicinal terminology, idk

"pineapple on pizza isn't even slightly weird. sweet and savory is one of the most common and proven food combinations. the whole controversy surrounding is just about flexing some sort of pizza elitism i'm *not* saying that you're lying if you say you don't like it. it's completely valid to not like it. but the fact that it's such a big deal is annoying. i'm from italy and people always expect me to be furiously anti-pineapple, but it's whatever ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",6
"by pitching a really fucking stupid slogan to my only cool client i'm in marketing, particularly in the business of slogans. so, a few days ago i was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and they told me they had a problem: they had an uncharacteristically shitty location.

there's no way people were just finding this place on their own. it was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. so, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.

last night, i went there to get some food... for research, ya know... anyway, i was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. the pizza was really good. the beer selection was varied. they had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. pretty good stuff. even if i wasn't writing for them, i would've given them 5 stars on yelp, is what i mean.

when i was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.

i wrote a lot of garbage for a while (""where wine country is next door!""), but i was determined to get something usable. 

finally, it hit me: ""go somewhere."" it had nearly everything i wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.

but, still, it wasn't quite there. it lacked the feel i wanted, felt a little too abstract. customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. they needed to be pointed.

after another hour or so, i had it.

eventually, the slogan i pitched these poor people was this:

""go somewhere else""

which, i believe the corporate equivalent of is like ""get the fuck out of my face.""

they haven't emailed me back.

tl;dr: today i fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan i wrote and i'm pretty sure i definitely lost a client because of it.",4

"update my 32m best friend 30 f asked if i would be her sperm donor for her surrogate, i am in love with her but sje has no idea. i appreciate all the feedback, most of you were nice. there was a few idiots telling me i needed to be alpha and be more manly.. but whatever. 

anyway the consensus with my rl friends was i needed to tell her. we do brunch on saturdays because she does yoga sundays so we met up this morning. 

i could barely eat and she could tell something was up. she got worried thinking i was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

i sat her down and told her everything how i realized i was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. i told her that i never said anything because i did not want to jeopardize our friendship. her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

i honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and i honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. she half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

we hugged and i told her that there is no one on this earth i would want to have a child with but her. we talked for hours ,in fact i just got home. we have decided that we want to focus on us for now. i want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

i know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

however i am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

thank you guys and gals for giving me the courage to tell her

"my 33m fiancee 27f chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. how can i ever repay her? two nights ago, my fiancee accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. the fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. i wasn't home, so i wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. if i was, i would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. it's just stuff. 

she chose differently. first, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. then she went back in. at this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. she knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

both of us have lost parents. i lost my dad 3 years ago. he was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before i actually met her. i have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom i have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. she lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

i don't even know how to begin to say thank you. i'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and i can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. i don't know how to repay her. or where to begin. can anybody think of a nice gesture i can make it up to her? she must be devastated. i can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

tl;dr: my fiancee had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. how do i repay her?",8

as the post says i am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **virginia**. i work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. when i was hired i wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. i think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that i'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. i have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. so then i had to buy a wireless mouse. i have a nice computer and i hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

today i have strep. strep as an adult is terrible. i told my boss i could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. that night on the phone she said yes please work from home. first thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. it is a google chrome timer extension. i told them that i would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but i was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. she said ok, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since i wouldn't install the timer and that i was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

"because i refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? i low key hate her. i'm 15 years old. i have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. i'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. she also doesn't understand stuff. that's probably the easiest way to put it. she's just a human body with nothing inside. 

she's my stepmoms daughter. my stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. i don't know my stepmom very well and i don't really get on with her. we are respectful to each other but i'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. i am always on my own and i used to hate it but i'm used to it now.

ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. that's fine, i get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that i don't want to do and i resent doing. stuff like staying home when i want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that i don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

my own mom passed away when i was small so i can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all i'm just a lot more angry than i used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever i say i don't want to do anything for her. even stuff like feeding her- like- i don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. i didn't ask for this. 

anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. she was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. i don't want to go and visit her. i remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and i just hate hospitals and i sort of hate my stepsister and i just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know i'm there. 

my stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. they haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because i don't want to visit. my grandma who lives in canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and i don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so i'm assuming my dad has told her i'm refusing to go. he keeps pleading with me but i keep telling him i'm not doing it. i told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and i need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.

"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪!!",6

"for refusing to give my niece our dog's room? for the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. i'll call her princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. she is a medical researcher (studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. i was apprehensive because i know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

we have a 4 bedroom house. me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler freddie. i told sister that princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed ok with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. princess even said it would be ok to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. it's getting a lot colder now and i'd never let freddie sleep outside. 

i told princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

in all honesty i was right in thinking having princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. she goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

she's also rude to my kids. my daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but princess was lovely enough to say that if her bf had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and i had a word with princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. i made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. i also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that i wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. sorry but how can i be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

edit: a lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. i won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. firstly to the people who have claimed i was acting snobby about princess's job. that wasn't the case. i wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that i could say she's ''only a researcher''. on the contrary, i specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. she earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. she just wanted more money to herself. 

also, the people who claim that i was being nasty to her because i didn't like her and things like that. i don't dislike her at all. i was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, i've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. i was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. she has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because princess constantly bullied her. 

regarding the dog's room. there isn't any furniture in freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

and for those who think i was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. we tried our best to make her feel welcome. gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. we gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, i went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. within her first week here, princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

regarding the weed and clubbing thing: i've nothing against weed use. i smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and i'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. if she was doing it away from the house i would not care at all. i wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. i'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. however, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

last but not least, i didn't call her ''princess'' on here offensively. i wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",3

"dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. how do i protect myself legally? i have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. a few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

the last few months have been hell. they have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. they are loud way past our community quiet hours. they have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). i have recorded it. it wakes up my 2 year old. do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

they leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. it has ruined my outdoor rug. i took pictures. 

they drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

they regularly park in the reserved spot i pay for monthly. it is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. they are an extra $50 a month. the minute i leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until i threaten to involve the apt. manager.

they have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

they like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. i have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. it ruined my potted plants outside. 

i have reported all the incidents. i have tried to ask them to cut it out. they don't care. 

i recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out i am not the first to complain that day. the police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (i am not sure of how it was found. i stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

since then they have taken to recording me any time i leave my apartment. they have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

the woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how i am impeding her ability to exist in public because i am racist. she says i call the police on her for doing nothing. i only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

i understand i am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. i would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

i just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot i pay for monthly, and play loud music i can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

she had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

they have really upped the bleach game too. it has gotten on a few spots on my door and i am scared they might throw it at my car. 

i have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. i can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

i can't lose my job and i am not sure how protect myself legally. 

they are actually my paid space right now but i am scared to have them towed because i don't know what they are going to do. i pay for that space. i have proof. the sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

if i tell the apartment they will have the car towed but i'll look like a racist. 

all it takes is one video and a lie and i am ruined. 

i want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but i think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that i pay for is reasonable. but maybe not?",2
"you're a piece of shit if you try to get somebody fired for their off-work behavior. i keep seeing these posts where somebody posts something racist on social media and somebody contacts their employer to try and get them fired. it seems to be one of the first reactions or pieces of advice every time somebody feels wronged.

&#x200b;

people have the right to be a piece of shit outside of the work place. the punishment has no relation to the offense and its basically thought crime. its not any different than keying their car. it's cowardly and childish.

&#x200b;

you don't know that person's situation or who depends on them. that person could be supporting children or a sick relative. and getting them fired will likely embitter them and reinforce their beliefs.

&#x200b;

there are obvious exceptions if there's implications for public safety or what not, but otherwise, if somebody can compartmentalize their behavior and be a good employee i really could not careless about what they do on their free time.

"if i don't share my rather large (to me at least) inheritance with my aunt and 3 cousins? 

some background: my grandfather just passed away at the end of january. he was closing in on 90 and lived a very full life and died very peacefully in his home which is exactly where he wanted to be. 

this is where the story gets very sticky, my grandfather lived in a cheap tract house and was very frugal. his only passions in life were woodworking and his garden. but to my huge surprised i was named as his sole heir with life changing money. with the house, everything in it and cash his estate was valued at a little over a million dollars. 

here's where it gets even stickier. my mom passed away 6 years ago. she had one sister who i was fairly close to and from her i have 3 cousins. i don't know the full details of why my aunt was estranged from my grandpa, in fact all my mom ever told me was ""it's between the two of them."" i have mixed relationship with my cousins and because their mom was estranged from my grandpa, they never had a nice word to say about him and i don't know if they ever met him. to be fair, they probably never had the chance to get to know him like i did. cousins and aunt did not attend the very small funeral i set up for my grandpa either. 


now she and my cousins have been basically calling me nonstop somewhere between begging me and demanding of me that i split the estate 5 ways. 

this is what both of my attorneys have essentially advised:
no matter what i shouldn't split the estate 5 ways. if i do decide to be incredibly generous, it should be split 50/50 and my aunt and cousins can divide their half however they like. both attorneys have advised against this period, as it's not in my best interest. 

i can write 4 $5000 checks out of the estate to get them to go away. $5000 in our state's probate system is generally seen as ""enough"" of an inheritance to be essentially be uncontestable and my aunt and cousins will have no further claim on my grandpas estate, or none that a judge would be willing to hear. the first attorney strongly advised i do this. 

i do nothing. i am carrying out my grandpa's wishes to the letter and that is my responsibility and also my benefit for staying close to him in his lifetime. this is my second attorney's preferred course of action. 

but this is not about the legality of the situation. this is about what should i do and would i be the asshole if i keep the entire estate for myself. just over a million dollars is enough money for me to finally fund a retirement account, have a down payment on a decent house and actually save some money. i have no designs on a big blow out but maybe updating my car would be nice. i could do all of that with $500k, but that number sure looks different that $1 million. 

basically, if i don't share this inheritance like my aunt and cousins are asking of me?",3

"by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye. well, fuck. 

not a throwaway because i have no shame left to feel. 

by orgasming so many times i went blind in one eye. that's right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

seriously, though. last night i was trying to sleep (obligatory ""not technically today"") but failing miserably. i have bipolar disorder, i'm off my medication (that is a in itself), and i was in the early stages of a manic episode. for those who aren't batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. i tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my mothman musical, and thinking about al gore. at about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, i decided i had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

enter stage left lesbian porn. here's the part where i mention how my clit is made of steel. i came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. for some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. having finished the porn (which i actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) i decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. now, whenever i'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, i always have to go completely under the covers. unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where i live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? anyway, for some reason i can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. maybe saudi arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? since this incident i've only slept for four hours. i'm losing my mind. 

anyway, at this point i'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. after ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. my clit breathes a sigh of relief and i emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. my right eye is stinging a little bit, and i realise the acne treatment i'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. i grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

i'm sure you can see where this is going, but i certainly didn't. and now i could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. i wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. the weird angle i'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. for some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. i felt genuinely betrayed. like, how dare you? you did this to me. this is your fault. et tu, clite? 

once my eye starts to swell up, i call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. arguably the weirdest walk of shame i've ever done. 

i continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. the swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. my eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

now i've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that i'll probably have to cancel. i've been wanting to bang this guy for weeks. also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and i can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish i'm shit out of luck. 

tl;dr: i masturbated and now i'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

edit: sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? this blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if i wrote it. damn my unforgettable mothman musical. anyway, i did not cancel my dick appointment. i told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (less endearing when i got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. i've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. hallelujah.

"the fact that google is stealing our right to privacy, and even listening in 100% of the time of our conversations should have caused us to fight back, but no one does. my generation and onward will just continue to sit at let these companies walk all over us. there was a time where tapping someone's phone was illegal without a proper warrant. most people i know won't talk about ideas or something possibly illegal going down with phones in the same room, and rightly so!

"for singling someone out at a comedy show? i do stand up. i also have a day job, because, you know, survival. 

i mentioned at work that i couldn't do any shifts after 4:00 on saturday because i had a show. my coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

i had no problem helping him out and i knew this club wouldn't care if i slid a couple people in. but i've been trying to get more bookings at this place and it's kind of a level up from the sort of places i usually get to perform at so i told them, you know, ""please make a point to laugh.""

i'm up there doing my show and i see them and they're the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren't laughing. it bugs me a little but i didn't want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. then i see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. 

so i start telling a joke about a time i gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as i'm doing it i'm slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes i'm talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn't notice or look up until i'm literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

it killed, so that was the good part. but when i showed up to work i was expecting an apology from him. instead he was expecting an apology from me for (i'm quoting here) ""inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke"" ""making him look like a fool in front of his girl"" and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

he basically summarized it as ""you're supposed to be a professional and if you couldn't handle me texting you shouldn't be in show business.""

i think, without question, that he's the asshole. but he doesn't believe me and the only people i could tell this story to and ask to confirm i'm not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased. 

who's the asshole?

"ca i want to divorce my wife of 6 years, who has been a jehovah's witness for the last 4 years because of the extreme teachings of the cult, and how it could affect our children (3,1). so i started looking deeper into all of this amidst my wife and i's simultaneous suspicions that her mentors within her church were ""poisoning us.""  they would bring us food all the time over a couple month period, and we were constantly sick.  since cutting those people out we have been better.  i want to the hospital to have us all screened, but they referred us to a social worker, who is talking with police on the matter.   

this is when i started looking deeper into this ""religion.""  long story short, i want as far away as i can from this stuff as well as my children.  i'm a military veteran who is 29, and has supported my family entirely up until now.  i have only been out of the military for a a little over a year now, and have bad anxiety and ptsd issues that have made attaining a job hard, so i'm living off my gi bill through the military (monthly check to supplement education post military -36 months), and military disability.  my spouse is hesitant to work, because the people in her religion tell her a wife should be at home.  

i thought i was being a supportive husband by supporting her choice of religion, but now that i've learned more, i can't.  i've tried to talk calmly about this to her many times, but it goes nowhere.  the religion is designed to warn her about people like me, ""worldly"" people.   she goes on talking about ""the end"" all the time like she is anticipating it.  i hate to say it, but i fear the brainwashing has potentially dulled her sense of reality.   even after knowing these people could have poisoned her own children, she defends the organization as a whole.  she doesn't want to go to any conventional counseling because ""other people don't need to know our problems.""  i have no idea what do to at this point.

i probably will be supporting our family by my previously mention means while i try to get mentally stable again to work full time over the next couple of years.  i only have about $15,000 in savings, and i own our only vehicle, a fully paid off car.  we have furniture and stuff but i'm not attached to any of it.  i have a life insurance policy that was converted from my military sgli to a vgli and that's it for assets.   other than that, no big debts or anything.   

over the last 4 years, this is kind of how the split has been raising the kids:

2016,17:  i was in the military, my wife would handle the morning routine with the kids because i left early in the morning and got home in the afternoon, and would play with the kids and help with everything like cleaning, brushing teeth, putting to bed etc.  the only thing i didn't do much was cook, which i only did maybe once a week.  



2018,2019 (post military):  i spent 2018 looking for and working several different jobs that didn't last long, mostly in part to stress and adjustment disorder, and as a result only worked about 5 months last year, which ate into savings. besides that, we have done everything in terms of taking care and spending time with the kids kids equal.

as i right this, i hide my children's easter eggs alone in the backyard, as my wife will stay in the bedroom today because of the ""holiday"" she is not allowed to celebrate.   the psychological effect of never having their mom around for birthdays and holidays is only going to get worse, and it's hard on me to have to see them do it alone. what kind of parent doesn't want to have fun with their children smh.   

what is a divorce going to look like with her? i really just don't want to give up my disability pay for life or my gi bill payments for school.  furniture, car, belongings can be split idgaf.  i don't want to pay her long term.

the following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. on thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. i was so nervous i thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. he said that he's sorry he wasn't around much the days after but i was like no it's fine i haven't been home either, i knew it wasn't on purpose. the vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said 'like maybe you have a good soul if that's a thing' and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. and then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how i felt and he said 'sorry i'm not trying to make this a big thing i just want to make sure you're okay with everything and i want to make sure you feel respected'. i was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. i said that i was fine and that i felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. he said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we're both happy living together whatever happens. i said i agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

it was all really sweet and nice and i think that whatever happens, he's a respectful guy and we'll communicate and we'll be mindful of each other. at one point while we were talking he did say 'sorry we've gotten off track, but i felt it was important we didn't just discuss what happened, i wanted to get to know you a bit. it was a spontaneous thing so i'm glad you agree that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it, and there's no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. we'll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that's all we can do. and maybe we'll have sex again too if you're also up for that.'

ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. due to an unrelated incident a while back, i have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my google drive. i played the calls with my manager to the attorney. when my manager informed me of the preliminary result i explained to her my prescription medication and my adhd. the attorney told me it was good that i disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and adhd would not cause any issues in performing my duties). i was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. the call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but i would be paid for my one day of work. as far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if i knew i would fail. i had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

i asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because i signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. she would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. she said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. she said ultimately the point of having a lab test and mro is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the mro is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. if it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of hr and their legal department. when she initially talked to the head of hr, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. he called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. my attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if i could come into her office that afternoon. i agreed.

when i was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of hr, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. essentially this call was an apology to me. the head of hr profusely apologized for this. he went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in hr and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. if he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. he went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of hr felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. they want me to come back in monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. he stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" he even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch monday.

he told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my adhd. i told them that wasn't necessary as i am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

so now i have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of hr. i owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. i wish i could personally shake hands with all of you. i was so scared before reading your comments. thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

edit: i'm going to disclose my medication. i take vyvanse. a lot of people assume i'm taking adderall. i used to take adderall but my doctor suggested i try vyvanse when it came out. although similar and made by the same company, vyvanse is a much better medication for me. the release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as adderall, my appetite is not affected, i sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that adderall does when wearing off.

"airport confiscated insulin my diabetic (t1) mother flew from michigan to florida today with a connecting flight in philadelphia. she has been having a lupus flare up, so i arranged for a wheelchair for her weeks ago to take her to her gates/baggage claim. i also confirmed that she could bring a medical bag with get insulin and medication. when she landed in philadelphia, they said they didn't have a chair for her so she had to walk across multiple terminals to get to her gate. when she was boarding the plane, the ticketing agent told her she couldn't bring the medical bag on board (basically an insulated lunch box). she explained it had insulin in it which she needs to have with her. they told her she could check it or she could stay in philadelphia, but she couldn't bring it on board. she surrended the bag, boarded the plane super upset. when she landed in tampa, the wheelchair guy was waiting for her. he took her to baggage claim and i guess her medical bag was lost. she is now in florida with no insulin, no medication. her doctors are working with her insurance to get authorization for her get enough to hold her over. 

i am beyond upset. i have called aa and they confirmed that insulin is allowed on board. what legal ramifications are there for this?

"update: landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. good news! well, here's my update! and with good news!

so first of all, i just wanted to say: wow. the amount of support i received, both in replies and in pms, was absolutely amazing. everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. the person who said ""sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

that said - i feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). he's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. he grew up in rural (arkansas, i think? that or alabama) and came to ma later in life. this was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. that, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

i know some of you were hoping i'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, i decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

yesterday i sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. he realized very quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. he also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. he just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

we ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if i weren't having the conversation with him i'd think he were a caricature). he's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so i think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". he seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. i reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

he still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. he seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. he agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which i will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

the past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. if things go well, i might even potentially renew the lease come september. i'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but i think i'll leave the issue where it lies for now. if this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, i'll go at him with everything i can in the future - but for now i'm satisfied. i'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",2

"update from the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on christmas original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  my girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

i posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. it got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and i was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and i fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the big talk.

little did i know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. i didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. so thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, i got a dreaded ""we need to talk"" text. yep, all caps. and i was like ""welp, i'm dead.""

she was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). still, she said i had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and i agreed/apologized. she knows i'm writing this update and she's going to read it before i post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

we talked for a long time thursday night. she said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. it's partially a cultural thing, according to her. gf was born and raised in the u.s. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. she said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. she grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

on top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. she said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. she also got very little affection from her parents growing up. it seems like that was all replaced with material things. so, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

all that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. she was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. she was really hurt that i said i thought i was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and i said i was sorry, and i am. i was still raging a little when i wrote that. i asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. it wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

we've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. i'm totally fine this. we've been together for almost 3 years and i think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. she's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. we spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. it's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. i'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. no one can change their habits overnight.

we're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. the plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. she also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. it's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. we're going to give it until my lease is up in march (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. she isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before march.

tl:dr: thanks, reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. i did and i think things are going to get better.

edit

to everyone who's wondering, her parents are from mexico.

gf has a job and her own income. she is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. you're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. in that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. that's now just out there for the whole world to read. you can't say that wouldn't be alarming. she said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. all things considered, i think she was pretty reasonable about it. ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure i thanked reddit for the perspective. no, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. she's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",8
"i (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. idk what to do anymore. i'm posting because i cannot share this with my family and i can't talk to my friends either.

wife and i have been married for 4 years, together for 12. last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. my brother was my hero. he was there for me when my parents abandoned us. he was there for me when i struggled with depression. he's like a father figure to me. 

so my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. he told me that it was very important. we met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. he told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. and he also started suspecting it. i was really shocked by this revelation. because my wife never told me about this. and i never imagined she would cheat on me.

but when i confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. she didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. but my brother claims it was consensual. 

we ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. i just want to kill myself. my brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

i'm really torn. i don't think my brother is a rapist. but i'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. also, she never told me this. she had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. idk what to do now. i think i'm just leaving. but i want some advice to cope up.",8
"for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though i'm not religious? i'm an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

i have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. i would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

they get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don't need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

i used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work i do. she couldn't give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

even though i'm a known atheist i decided i too wanted some time to meditate everyday. i told my manager i needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. she initially said no, and then i got a hastily written email saying of course i was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. she'd obviously checked with hr and covered her ass. 

for the last six months i've been having my 30 mins 'meditating' out in our company garden everyday. this has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have 'meditative time' and it's causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

i recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that i was being rude and 'ruining it' for everyone else and that at xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. i told her i'm not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",3
"my friend brought her new date over for dinner and i jokingly vetted him in front of everyone by asking if'd ever killed anyone. he said yes. as it's often the case, this didn't happen today, but a few years ago when i was maybe 15yo, young and naive.

my mom's best friend back then was v, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.

v is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. after losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. she brought to our home a few men over the years.

one of those times, v had invited over for dinner a man (let's call him a) who she introduced to us as a ""good friend"". a was a middle-aged man originally from bosnia. he now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.

for those of you not fully aware of bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. it's a small country in the balkans (eastern europe, north of greece), and it used to be part of the former yugoslavia. long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including a.

that evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know a better. he seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. we start asking him questions about how long he's been out of bosnia, etc.

i start to think of something witty to say to ""vet"" him. something funny.

i asked him if he'd ever killed someone, jokingly.

he looked at me, all serious. he said yes. everyone became silent.

he went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. they were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person's. he wasn't a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.

i felt horrible for asking this. when i thought i was just making a joke, i opened up some really painful memories. things that were not easy for him. still today, many years later, i can't imagine how he must feel living with such memories. and it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.

after a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. we never spoke about that again.

—

tl;dr: i thought i'd make a funny joke and ask my friends' date at dinner if he'd ever killed anyone. turns out, he did during the civil war in former yugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. the joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day.",4

"banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat. in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: here(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

i used to take the bus daily to get to work. not a big deal, i'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

but every thursday was awful. every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. still, generally not an issue because i'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

but this bus company was not reliable. we have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. one day, a little school bus came instead. it had 9 seats. since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. so you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

i have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, i needed that time to sit down. so, that's what i was doing, as always.

the group gets on the bus, i've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. i look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. i take out my earbuds and she says to me that i need to give up my seat. the other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when i tell her i need it she says that i need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. i try my best to explain that medically i can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says i'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). so after a couple minutes of this i snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as i'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. she gives me a look like i just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

two days later when i tried to get on the bus i was told i was banned from the service.

when i called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. i explained the medical reasons i needed it and was simply told i have a lower priority because i'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as i ever knew. he ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as i know, but i feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

on my original post it was suggested a lot that i make a post here. i live in ontario, canada. i don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. i know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

anyway that's why i'm here for help. am i in the right to sue? for how much? i don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

edit: there's a lot of responses on here so i'm sorry if i don't get to everyone, but for now i will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the ontario human rights legal support center on monday. thanks everyone. i'll still be accepting further advice if there is more i should do though obviously i can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

"by bodyslamming a girl who wanted to hug me. i was in a new high school with absolutely no friends whatsoever and because i was very socially awkward i tried to avoid any direct confrontations with any individual whatsoever so i never really made any friends.

however in my fourth block there was this girl who i just seemed to have clicked with because out of all the students in the entire building she was the only one i really actually talked to. skip a couple of weeks i'm coming into my class when she decides to greet me with a friendly hug. 

in this moment i was completely frozen because i never really physically interact with anyone, especially females. so in this moment, i go full brain dead and as she's approaching me with open arms i decided i was going to try and be funny and pick her up from her waist and throw her over my shoulder (don't ask why i thought this would be funny, because i honestly have no clue what the fuck i was thinking) but the second she sees me go down and try and pick her up i could just see the complete and udder confusion in her face as she was just simply wanting a quick hug, but as i pick her up just to make things ten times worse, i shout,

""wwe supah slammmm!!"" 

and she's screaming and for some reason my heart just dropped realizing what i was doing and instead of lightly setting her down, i just fucking drop her and she slams right into a cluster of desks making this massive crashing sound in the middle of the room. i went to ask her if she was okay but she started crying her eyes out basically asking me what the fuck was wrong with me.

"update gf and i (26m/f) got into a huge fight over a keyboard previous post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)

short edit at bottom.
&nbsp; 

we met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. i was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so i suggested we meet at her place, so that i could bail if things went south...and they did.

&nbsp; 

even though i thought i made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my gfs coworkers figured out who the post was about (gf's age, working hr which i mentioned in a comment, same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my gf. the reason she wanted to meet early was because she was furious that i had made the post, 'airing our dirty laundry.' in a sense, i guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. my gf never used reddit so i figured i was safe.
there's a strong chance she'll read this one as well, lol.

&nbsp; 


anyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that i made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. i asked her to point out any part of it that wasn't true, or where i had lied. long story short, she couldn't point to a single thing. i definitely raised my voice when i told her that if she looked bad, it's only because of her actions. i told her i only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. the post was 100% accurate and she knew it. 

&nbsp; 

she began to tear up and asked me if i really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. i asked her if she understood that this wasn't about the keyboard. it was about the way she acted towards me when i was trying to do her a favor. she stayed silent and didn't answer. i asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was ok with her. i asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.

&nbsp; 

she got really defensive, asking ""are you calling me crazy?"" and ""do you think i'm unstable?"" i had no idea where she was going with this. i told her i wasn't calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that i was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it. 

&nbsp; 

we talked in circles for a bit, and i tried to pry it out of her. i still don't know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn't tell me. when i realized our conversation was going nowhere, i finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. she asked, ""what do you want from me?"" and i said, ""i want an apology.""

&nbsp; 

i'm getting tired of typing so i'll wrap this up quickly. she was absolutely unwilling to apologize. she thought that my ""betrayal"" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. we talked for about 5 more minutes before i told her that i don't even care anymore. i told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn't willing to help us get to the bottom if this. that we should just break up. i didn't waste any time making my way to the door.

&nbsp; 

as i was leaving, she asked if i wanted the keyboard back. she didn't ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. i could tell by her tone of voice. i told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.

&nbsp; 

i've been getting tons of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my fb). she obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like i really did leave her over the keyboard. i couldn't care less, as i'll never be seeing any of them again.

&nbsp; 

we only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, i don't feel terribly heartbroken. mostly just relief that it's over. but...also confusion. still have no idea why she acted out.

&nbsp; 

tl;dr: she wouldn't apologize or tell me what was wrong. after an exhausting conversation, i decided to end it.

&nbsp; 

**and to the people who had some unkind words towards me because i use a razer keyboard: pound sand, dorks. i like what i like.**

very short edit: she called earlier today and was very apologetic. my assumption is that she saw this post and read all the comments detailing how i was right for leaving her, among other things. i told her that she had her chance to apologize.",8
"by playing a joke on a colleague who took it seriously. i ended up losing a vacation day and got a disciplinary action in my file. i worked for a workman's compensation provider some time ago and there was a guy in my department - todd - who was mildly annoying.  nice enough guy, but just a bit juvenile.  he enjoyed pranks and was always trying to get a rise out of everyone in the office.  little things like taping our computer mouse or asking ransom for the return of our coffee cup. it got to be enough, so i decided he needed some payback.

he paid out a claim that was huge and he was nervous about it. i don't know why, but it just seemed like an opportunity to me, and so i waited. about a week later, in a team meeting (everyone was in on it but todd), i said that there were some payouts that were kicked upstairs for review and that it was a potentially serious situation.

a couple of days after that, i stopped and poked my head into his office and asked, ""did you payout x-amount on the smith file?"" he said he had and asked me why. i just walked away.

the following monday, i had my plan laid out fairly well.  after sharing the detail with my brother-in-law, he suggested that i borrow his black surplus impala cop-car and park it at the entrance. then, early that morning, i went about putting crime scene tape across the door to todd's his office.

i had the receptionist in on it too. when todd came in that morning, she would look at him, then fumble for the phone, turn her back and mumble into the receiver.

todd made it to the top of the steps when i rushed up to him and said, ""dude - go, just go!""

""what the hell are you talking about?"" he asked.

""just turn around and leave - drive, drive anywhere, just go!""

he shrugged me off, but i could tell that he was a little rattled. he turned the corner to see his office door blocked with crime scene tape and for a moment, he froze in his tracks. he walked past his office and around the corner, out of sight. he ended up slipping out through the stairwell.

he was gone for nine hours. i had to call his wife to get a message to him that it was a joke.

his absence meant that management got involved. i had to confess to being the perpetrator of the prank. i got a stern talking-to (my boss was trying really hard not to laugh) and i lost a vacation day as a result, but it was worth it.

todd doesn't tape my mouse anymore.


tl;dr  i played a practical joke on a colleague and he took it seriously


*edit:  i posted this thinking it might be amusing to a few of you and i wasn't expecting much of a response from it.  i have to say, i've enjoyed the pissy posts the most, the ones saying i went too far.  yes i did, which is why this was a fu.  for any of you worried about todd, he's fine.  this actually happened in 1993 and i posted it because todd and i were remembering it recently (and laughing) and so i had it on my mind.  yes, i still work with him (a different company now) and we've been friends for almost 25 years.*",4
"can the admins of this group do a better job of monitoring who is allowed in here please?! we have a new member, an elderly man. he's been privately messaging members, sending them naked pictures of himself in nasty poses along with close ups of his junk. he is offering up an iphone x in exchange for sexual favors. i am especially bothered because it turned out to be an iphone 8 and obviously something's wrong with it. it's super slow and the caps lock is stuck on.",0

"my 26f girlfriend 24f thinks she's an instagram influencer and it's driving me crazy! when i met my girlfriend 3 years ago, i knew very quickly she was addicted to instagram. she was posting maybe 3-6 times every single day and barely an hour of her day wasn't in her story.

this didn't really bother me at first - i actually found it kind of hot? mainly because all the pictures of food and buildings and clothes became pictures of me - i felt, i guess, a little like a celebrity (she had 6,000+ followers back then i think).

other than that, it's been a great and fulfilling relationship, but this addiction has been like a tree root splitting us apart. every day is punctuated by ""insta time"" where i'm not supposed to distract her, she gets up at bizarre times to post and maximize engagement which throws off her (and, by extension, my) sleeping habits, she's taking 2 hours to get ready for a 20 minute shopping trip, which is then stretched into over an hour for instagram content... it's ridiculous. we've squabbled about it before, obviously, and she brings up things about me that irritate her (for the sake of balance, i'm extremely messy and frankly, plain lazy. i'm trying to work on it), but recently she stunned me during an argument.

it was routine stuff, i asked (well, snapped) at her to put her phone down and pay me some attention, and she gave me a horrible stare and said 'this is my career, if you don't like it, get out'.

so the thing is, it's absolutely not her career. she desperately *wants* it to be, but so do probably millions of others. she's been unemployed and claiming benefits for 2 years, but i didn't realise all that time she was ignoring me for ig, she was actually trying to make money from it. i know she made about €20 about 6 weeks ago for advertising some makeup start up, but that was basically for a friend of a friend.

essentially, this is draining me to death, and it's gone from being flattering to intrusive. before you say it - yes, i'm probably going to break up with her. but the thing is, she's got a really good heart and i genuinely want to help her, even if the relationship doesn't survive (if it does, that would obviously be a plus). is there anything i can do to convince her to put the phone down and be a good, attentive girlfriend, and actually get a job that helps pay our bills?

tldr: girlfriend thinks she's an instagram celebrity because she made €20 through a friend, is actually just seriously addicted to the platform.",8
