"by buying everyone an ancestrydna kit and ruining christmas. earlier this year, ancestrydna had a sale on their kit. i thought it would be a great gift idea so i bought 6 of them for christmas presents. today my family got together to exchange presents for our christmas eve tradition, and i gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

as soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. she told us how she didn't want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. we explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

fast forward: our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

tl;dr i bought everyone in my family ancestrydna kit for christmas. my mom started freaking. now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

update:  thank you so much for all the love and support. my sisters, brother and i have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. no matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

update 2: christmas isn't ruined! my fu actually turned into a christmas miracle. turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. a good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. they never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. this is a christmas we will never forget. and yes, we are all excited to get our test results. merry christmas everyone!

p.s. sorry my mom isn't a whore. no you're not my daddy. ",4
"by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.. the overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. i bought a replacement bulb but when i put that one in it was also barely lighting up so i realized the unit was bad.  

the fan still worked great, it literally is the best fan i've ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. the fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so i didn't really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn't get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


so since then over the years my wife and i have had to make due with no overhead light. we open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. it's never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so i keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

after 6 years of living in the dark, this winter i just decided i would replace the damn thing. but before i did, i decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it's possible both bulbs i had tried were bad. 

so i'm up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as i'm turning the light on i realize:

the goddamn thing is dimmable. 


for 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to ""dim"". 

fuck me. 

tl;dr

for 6 years i lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",4
"by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.. today was the day i realised i messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

for the last 12 months i've been commenting on peoples posts, i've created my own posts. i haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as i can remember so i just figured i wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

last month i started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, i could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

anyway, i finally mailed the help team and found out my ip was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, i'm still in my own little truman show)

if you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

tl;dr i was muted one year ago and didn't notice. since then i've spent the whole time thinking how boring i must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

edit: so i've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! wilson and i thank you xx

edit 2: this is crazy! thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things i know nothing about. i'll figure it out and pay it forwards! special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - mvps!

please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that i've been such an idiot for so long. it's ok to laugh with/at me :)

edit 3: reddit is awesome. i've missed you guys! dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real pita. its just one of those things and i thank them for putting in the hours.

i also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. most of us here use reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

i love all of you weirdos <3

edit 4: no more i promise. i'm completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. i'm trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. i created an /ama when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/egcbe6w

stop giving me gold! i appreciate it but give to charity instead! heres something different we could do <3

"i have officially branded myself as the biggest perv... and i 100% deserve it.... this is his now ex-wife.

did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same reddit app? i logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

i've removed all of this personal story for my family's protection and changed this account's password. although it might be too late and already circulated online.

i took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

i'm only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags do not.

i came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. i saw his update saying i seemed alright, but i was keeping it in for the next morning.

reason we slept in the living-room is because i didn't want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before i finished packing. it wasn't ""fun camping"" or a ""picnic"".

this morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

i went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

i'm not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this reddit gold to the comments that i feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

oh, and if you can read this, i've deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

"by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my gf. minor background: i am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. i'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that i was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but i also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. i'm not gay, i just am me.

so while i was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. mine makes me look like a star wars character and his looks like the outlaw josey wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. the first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. whatever. so i get a call from my gf, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so i bid these mean girls and shawlbro adieu and head home.

i'm still wearing the shawl when my gf arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until i take it off. we get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if i'm gay. and she's really serious and aggressive about it. i tell her i'm not, that if i was i'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that i own a shawl. anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. so yesterday i invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to the big city, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually i just tell her very politely to get fucked because i'm pretty insulted by this point. on the way back, now that i'm not directly in front of her, i get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because i wore a shawl.

later on, i tell shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

we are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

tl;dr: me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

she's a nice girl, she's just not pickin up what i'm puttin down. it's a silly thing to be mad about.

"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw. so this happened a few days ago and i'm still not sure i'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

i've been with my girlfriend for about a year and i already know she is the love of my life. she's perfect for me. we're perfect for eachother. we're getting ready to move in with eachother and i want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

we went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

she went to the bathroom while i had her phone, and as i was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. if you have an iphone you know what i'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. it's annoying as hell.

but some photos caught my eye. some photos that i really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

there she is, the love of my life, trying to get her mouth around the biggest dick i've ever seen in my life. i've watched porn - a lot. i've never seen a dick like this. i'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. longer and thicker. as far as i could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

i could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

i closed the pictures and i've acted like nothing has happened, but i cannot get these images out of my mind. i've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats i'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

we haven't had sex since. i can't concentrate on my work. i just wish i had never seen those damn pictures.

tl;dr accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

/r/tifu last weekend. ,4
"by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.. recently, i traveled to denver, colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  as a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing i was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  what could possibly go wrong?

so the first thing i do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  and oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""are you looking for a mellow body high?  or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""yes, yes and yes!""  i reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  in hindsight, if i learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  sure, i can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite avogadro's number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

and it was at this dispensary that i also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and i were staying at).  as a result, before leaving, i begged my wife to buy some edibles that i could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  after expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

when we finally get back to the hotel room, i tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  what the fuck, denver?  seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that i should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" i read silently as i start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  but what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  so a second later, i covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

and then i quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  we may not have legal weed back home, but i routinely devour an entire package of milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

about 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  and that's when things start to go tits-up.  my stomach growls.  loudly and angrily.  my wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""diarrhea?""  but i merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""you didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""of course not."" i respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

a few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  i don't remember how i made it to my seat, and i don't remember even looking at the menu, but i do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if i was doing alright.

""keep it together, man,""  i say to myself.  but my wife's sudden groan suggests that i may have also said that to the waiter.  things are going downhill fast.

the waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

the moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  i start to worry that the jig is up.  

""you are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  not quite knowing what to do, i reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

at this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" i reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

my wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""bathroom. now."" she hisses. ""get it together.""  i reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  after splashing several handfuls of water on my face, i approach a urinal and start to pee.  

now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  as i am peeing, i start to get the very unsettling feeling that i have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

but deep down i know that is absurd:  i've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  i've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  so given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like i am about half way done -- that means that i've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

but the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  i try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

after finally finishing, i again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

next, i try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but i am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- i figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  to my wife's horror, i stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  but he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  he also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, i should probably eat one or two so that i'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

smart man. 

however, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, i start to get worried that i need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""do you think i should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" i suggest helpfully to my wife.

""what?! we literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

and at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""how many cookies did you eat?!"" she demands.

""whoa, easy there, torquemada,"" i respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""i had a few cookies, but keep it down.  i don't want your parents to know how fucked up i am right now.""

""really?!  they are sitting two feet away from you.  they know.""

i look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

tl;dr: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


edit:  wow!  thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  i think i have officially peaked in life.

as for part ii of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  at that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before i either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  so after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a secret service agent evacuating the president.  my night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  but being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",4
"by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again.. i'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because i'm an idiot.

i had my second dentist appointment today. i actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. he had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. his face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. i was a bit concerned and also confused. like how could i have embarrassed him this time? i had hardly spoken! so he keeps working in there and then i realize what the hell is happening. my dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. i had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time.

"by having my reddit history revealed by jimmy kimmel live on tv. this happened to me yesterday and i'm still baffled.

it all started when i posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor william h. macy. i couldn't stop laughin over it but i never thought it would gain so much attention. 

however it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes i could have imagined. this alone was crazy for me because i never expected to have a submission on the front page.

when i checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links i received. i checked them and found my submission on the latest jimmy kimmel show with reddit co-founder alexis ohanian. i was mind blown over this.

they proceeded talking over reddit users and jimmy ended up checking my history. well i hardly ever post filthy stuff but i commented on a nsfw a few days ago and i think jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

i don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. on the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. however i regret nothing!

tl;dr: jimmy kimmel had reddit co-founder alexis ohanian as a guest. they ended up browsing my reddit history and jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

"by cumming into a coconut. edit: i got an ama thread now. help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


this didn't happen today but quite a few years back. for obvious reasons i'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

anyway, around 8 years back i lived in northern mozambique, a coastal southern african country with quite a warm climate. my mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. one of these was coconuts. she would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


anyway, being a horny teenager i fapped in regular intervals. unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and i was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. one day i hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. honestly to this day i can't fathom why i thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


i end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. i decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. i fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so i blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

for the next week the coconut is my saviour. whenever i want to get off i simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. it's heaven. now before i continue i'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


about a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (i had been using it pretty much every day since then) i begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. must be the coconut right? so i decide that i'll fuck it once more before i throw it out and get a new one.


**worst mistake i have ever made.**


you see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. as i penetrate the coconut one last time i begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. puzzled, i pull my cock out to discover that it is covered in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *teeming with tiny fucking maggots*. they were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


i screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck i was doing with my life. 


**never again. never again.**


tl;dr don't fuck coconuts.



edit: jesus this exploded. i'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because i sure cry everytime i think back to it.

"by asking reddit which ethnic group to exterminate. today i had been looking forward to the qualifying for the formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing reddit whilst also watching some older formula 1 footage on youtube. so it got me wondering, ""some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they're just boring and far too controlled"". so i posed the question to /r/formula1 to ask their opinions also. shortly after posting, it transpired that the way i had asked the question could be perceived as...a little...'hitlerish'. check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. it somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. unfortunately for me, i am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that i must open every single one. it would actually play on my mind so badly that i wouldn't be able to sleep if i didn't open them, so i must open and read every goddamn comment. probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. i thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where i was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. but then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ usa woke up. and i've been playing catch-up ever since. took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. let's see what i go back to now...

i'm really glad that i could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn't the original intention, but it's a great positive to take away from this experience!

edit 2: update - at around 20:20pm gmt, i opened up alienblue on my ipad to read these comments faster than on the official reddit app, and when i started from there i had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, i now have 976 unread messages -.-

edit 3: update - it's now 21:09pm gmt, i did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it's back up in the 4 digits. i am seriously sleep deprived right now, i have been awake since 16:00pm yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. finally they've subsided and i'm feeling really tired now, so i shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. i honestly didn't think this post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

edit 4: finally i'm able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. back down under 1000 left to go now, and it's been a truly interesting experience. i didn't realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, i also didn't expect some of the truly deplorable messages i have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. it's 6:00am gmt here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

edit 5: final edit, i'm now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17am. it's been great to see this happen, and i'm sorry to those who thought reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

tl;dr - made a post asking a question, worded it wrong and now everyone thinks i'm a racist bastard.",4
"by telling my son's new doctor we are anti-vaxx. obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

my son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. we decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. i brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which i reply, ""oh, no he can't have that, i don't want him to get autism.""

i should maybe note here that i am an aspie too, and while i think my sarcasm is on point, i must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. the silence lasted an eternity while i imagine she was deciding how to proceed. eventually i laughed and tried to assure her i was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

as my son and i were discussing whether i was offensive (he thought i was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. he started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. he just kept saying, ""okay, well i have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

tl;dr: jokingly told my son's new doctor that i didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

edit: of course we took the gardasil. shout out to nurse pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. i wish everyone could have a nurse pete. also, since i'm editing, thanks for the awards!",4
"by performing the ""major tom"" technique and now i think i'm going to be disowned. if you aren't familiar with the ""major tom"", it's because it's a thing i (hopefully) came up with. it's a form of ""auto-erotic asphyxiation"" by using gravity.

basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. this part is called ""getting in the shuttle.""

as you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. this is considered ""take off.""

if performed correctly, you should become very lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. this is called ""being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

this is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **i, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. you see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. no oxygen = no consciousness.

when i ""took off"" i fucking jumped up at mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. because the next thing i know i was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

before i could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if i was okay. she heard my re-entry. this part is called ""disappointing your mother.""

you can just imagine the scene she walked into.

she stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. i stared back with what i thought was confidence like i was buzz aldrin and just got back from the moon. but thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while i was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (at least not to my knowledge.)

she ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more judge judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. i cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and i managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

i'm currently writing this in my room right now, and i don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until i can think of what to say to her. if there is anything to say at all.

**tl;dr: tried a new experimental masturbatory technique, ended up passing out, mom caught me with my pants down, and now i'm stuck in my room. planet earth is blue and there's nothing i can do.**

**edit: only do this if you have a safe place to land if you fall. it is extremely easy to hit your head and die.**

"by agreeing to an ""open relationship"". obviously a throwaway. 

to put things into perspective, i (m 20) and my gf (f 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

we decide to spice things up a bit and ""open"" up our relationship a little. it was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole ""sex is fun"" idea.

she is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she's met a guy (m 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn't working at the time. i agreed. i tell her to go for it, and she does. she texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

the week after, she mentions she's meeting up with this guy again. wasn't expecting it but i'm cool with it. again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. a decision i would live to regret. she doesn't text me the entire night. weird, but okay maybe she's just having a good time?

the next day i receive a load of messages about how she needs a ""break"" from ""everything"" right now. meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. a little more conversation and we're over. she's completely cut me out of her life. i check her snap chat story, and of course, she's with him. i've heard from her friends that they're dating now. 

tldr; agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",4
"by sending nudes to my employee group chat.. tldr at the bottom- 

well i recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). with that being said i'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. i also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

we have a groupme for the store i work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
the previous night i had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that i was with at the time. no biggie right? 
the next morning i had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. noon rolls around and i needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue i was having with a computer i was working on. 
i typed what i needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as i clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, i hit send without thinking and go on about my day. i should also probably say that by this time i was working alone and closing so no one else was around. the customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left i went to check my phone and saw i had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first i thought he was just calling me about the question i had, while the phone was ringing, i went back to look at the groupme, to my horror i clicked not just a picture from the night before, but the whole damn video. my heart dropped, instantly when i realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. i tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. lol on the bright side the coworker i had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


tldr: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out i send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

"by giving my son permission to beat his bully's ass.. my son was born with a condition called pectus excavatum. in layman's terms, his chest is sunken in. his condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. in december, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

about three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. the kid has been through a lot. 

well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. and because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, ""dad, i'm cleared now. a kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. can i kick his ass?"" well, my son isn't really a fighter. he's fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he's always gotten his ass kicked. so i just figured he was just talking. but this is the first i had heard about the bullying and i was concerned. i could tell he was distressed about the situation so i told him to knock the fucker out. he just nodded and went to his room. 

now, his older brother is s tough sob. he had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he's in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. i talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don't get in trouble. he told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. i asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. while i kinda agree with his thinking, i instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

the next morning i took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. on the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. ""have you taken xxxxx to school yet? well, after you do, go pick up your son. he got in a fight."" i just assumed it was my oldest son. imagine my surprise when i walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! he was beaming! he pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. ""i warned him."" i was so proud. 

he had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. my older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. he said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. he got suspended for three days. 

tl;dr i gave my son permission to beat up his bully because i didn't think he would and he did it.

edit one: the kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. it wasn't malicious. just two boys clowning around. he was horrified that he had hurt my son. the bully punched my son in the head every day. once he found out my son couldn't do anything about it, he just kept on. my son wasn't the only one he bullied, either. also, the bully's brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son could fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

edit two: my son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a lot of new friends. he used to hate going to school but now he's disappointed that school is out for summer. crazy!

edit three: thanks for the precious metals! and holy shit! front page?!?!",4

"by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home. my friend jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and i finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  i ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

i made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  dude was intimidating and i'm a 4'11"" woman so i was immediately scared.  he looked shocked to see me.  i'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that i surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

i panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  i'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  i start screaming at him to get the fuck out and that i'm calling the police (total bluff because i didn't have my phone.)  he then yells back that he is calling the police on me.  this gives me pause.  at this point, i look around and realize the bedroom i'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  i ask him through the door if he knows jenna (last name).  he tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  well.  apparently, jenna's neighbor also keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

so, today i fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

tl;dr today i fucked up by wasting a sandwich.",4
"by sleeping with a married woman.. so, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. nsfw or for anyone, really. and i may not be alive much longer, because i'm probably going to be murdered.

i'm at the bar the other night, watching the hall of fame game. after it's over, i go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before i uber home. this girl sitting next to me, very attractive. out of my league. like wayyy out. i'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. and she asks me 

""hey! can i trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""uhh what?""

 ""can you watch my stuff while i go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust greg, he's really nice"". annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. just random shit. showed pictures of our dogs to each other. talked about shows n stuff. typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. she asks if i've ever seen the show years and years. i say ""no, but i've seen the band perform live"". so she goes on about how great the show is, and how i need to watch it. asks if i have hbogo. ""yes because i forgot to cancel my cable after got"". so she makes me download the app, so i could start watching it when i get home. thanks for the recommendation! i'll probably check it out never. so a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. i have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""that's okay, i have pets too"" (or something like that. all i was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""i mean i guess, but i have to be at work early tomorrow""

""that's okay, i can only stay 30-40 minutes and then i'll have to go home""
""that's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time i'll need! am i right, fellas??

no. nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

it's about, 11pm at this point. i think? and mind you, i've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

so we tab out, get in her car. which is a stick shift. and i say ""oh no shit, i like you even more now! no one drives a stick anymore! i drive one every day!"" which i'm excited about, because at this point i'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows i like, and imma bout to get laid""

we talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). which is just a half mile away. so was a short drive. she parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

go inside, i try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. while i try to get my chromecast set up on my living room tv. ya know, to ""watch hbogo"".

she runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

it's fucking evan williams.

and this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

kids, i've slept with some strange in my time. i don't know how or why i get myself into these situations. i honestly feel that i'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. sure i troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but i do genuinely care about other people. being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. but in this case, i was dead wrong.

so after some talking about random shit. we get the show playing. i couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

sex.

so after, we're just laying there. pillow talk. was a good night. i just got laid. she asked if she could stay the night. we're gonna go to sleep. everything is cool. i let her know that i have to be at work in a few hours, so i need to get some rest.

now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* right?

wrong.

i say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""i don't think so""

""what why?""

""i don't think my husband would appreciate that""



i am speechless. i don't think i've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. like, how the fuck did i not see this coming. omg imma home wrecker. i'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

me: ""ummmmmmm what? is this an open relationship? does he know where you're at? like, why didn't you tell me that?""

her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""uh yeah, i'd be pretty pissed if i was him""


now i've been cheated on before. and that feeling sucks. i've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. where i didn't know that i was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. i had found out a couple days later, and i found him on fb and let him know. he thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. cheating is the worse thing ever.

so this is where shit starts to hit the fan. i don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

her: ""we're getting separated soon""

me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""yea but that's okay""

""how is that okay?""

""he's been..... abusive""


there's a slight pause, then she starts crying. so this is where the sober me starts to kick in. this girl is struggling. she's in a bad spot. and no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. and now i'm trying to empathize with this trashy evan williams drinking bitch. like i legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

que the panic attack.

she starts going nuts. ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. knocking shit over. basically trashing my house.

she asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. which i do. she takes it. and calms down. (for the most part).

now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. i tell her that we need to go to sleep. because i have to work in the morning. she tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" btw, evan williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

we finally get to sleep around 4? maybe? i wake up late, she wants round 3. and who doesn't like morning sex. i'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. so i gave her a fuck.

anyways, i need to leave for work. but her car is blocking mine. i tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. and told me i couldn't move it because ""i didn't know how to drive it"" 

""uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. i drive a stick every day, i can move your car""

i move her car. i leave for work. and i just let her stay at my house. i let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. two, i was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before i get home.

a couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. i get concerned, because i'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. i came to the conclusion that i should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... but, i see that she had already messaged him. from my facebook account! my computer was still logged into fb when i left, and i didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

i tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. he lets me go home. when i get home, i find her still naked in my bed. i get her friend to get her an uber. and i leave. oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

go back to work. thinking everything is over. that's the end of that. wrong again.

i get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. and only that shirt. like vag all out and everything. this girl is afraid to go home. which i'm worried about at this point. because i want her to go somewhere safe. she's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

oh yea, she had me find her phone. which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. and several others from other people.

she hands me $20 to order a pizza. and after we eat the pizza, she'd uber home. fuckin bet. i ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

i kid you not. i'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. and she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

this bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and i'm just ready for her to leave.

sex.

after, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. asking to go home. and i'm like 

""i'll get you an uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""no""

""what do you mean 'no'? you can't get in an uber with your pussy out""

""no""


so i gather up all of her belongings and clothes. and try to help her get dressed. to which she refused to allow me to do.

most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... that ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#i had the same feeling when i got her panties on.

pizza arrives. i go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. come back inside. panties are off again. god dammit.

we never even opened the pizza box. she's saying that she wants to go home. but is refusing to get dressed. i'm starting to panic myself. because i don't know how i got myself into this situation. but, am me.

she eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. and i read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""i'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where i'm at"" ""come get me"". and him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

that last one though. that's what i did.

before i called 911, i offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because i knew the husband would give her a ride back there. and not to my house. because now i'm starting to worry about my safety. i don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. but then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

i told them that i have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. etc. i tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

the ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. this girl is drunk crying. trying to get me to go for yet another round. where at this point, my dick hurts. also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

finally got her panties back on, i didn't tell her that i had called the cops. i told her that the uber was coming. and was trying to get her to put her pants on.

cops show up, i go outside. explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. but i kept my calm. i told them that i was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. but they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. she wanted to go home. officers ask if she was presentable. i pop my head back in the door. she's still wearing my shirt and her panties. so i'm like ""i guess?"", and then i let them in.

she yells ""are you fucking serious? you called the cops?"" 
""uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. even though you said you did. plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what i did""

the officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

que crying and what not.

cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. which i do. her husband calls her phone, so i accept the call, and then put it up to her face. tell her to tell him what's happening. and that she is getting an uber home. apparently her card and paypal was getting declined for the ride. so she couldn't do it herself. they live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. i live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a lyft/uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... girl finally decides to get dressed.

i had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... i could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. lol.

anyways, i hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. made sure she had all of her belongings. we get her to walk out of my house to the uber. but she tried to grab the bottle of evan williams. to where i audibly laughed. ""i don't think they'll let you take that""

cops didn't let her take it. she got in the uber and she was gone. policeman handed me the bottle back. where i say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

po-po leave, i call it a night, and it's over.

flash forward to today. i get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. i was at work at the time. so i wasn't able to check. but i'm 98% certain i handed those over to the cops. i look for them when i get home. found nothing.

oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

so that brings us to now. i haven't heard anything from her. or the husband. and i'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. but ya. know what? fuck it. i'm glad i could share this story with y'all. there might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

the moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

jk don't do that.

and don't stick your dick in crazy.

tldr: took a girl home who i didn't know was married. she trashed my house.

edit: i'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while i deal with mine.

edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2gia

edit 3: her car is still there. can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. i'm still alive. i see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. i'll get to them when i can.

edit 4: fml. i sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. no response. bartender texted me late last night and asked if i used a condom. which many of you have asked.... and no. i didn't. the girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. so i think i may have been baby baited.

edit 5: i'm still not dead. her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. i just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. so i walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... this woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. and she's most likely high on meth. because when i asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" she said ""no, noooo hehe"" i'm like ""yea, i'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

**update**

i've been texting a mutual friend of the couple. apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. i'm in the works of a tifupdate. but i'll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. i'd like to protect the privacy of those involved, but i'm just too lazy to do it right now.",4
"by thinking divorce was an april fools gag. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

my borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. they told the family they are getting divorced. i broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying i'm no april fool.

*edit*

wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

*edit 2*

i don't think i'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. this blew up and i just got multiple texts from my wife telling me i fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... and i didn't change any names 

*edit 3.0*

ok it's been fun everyone, i may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. 

*edit 4.0*

uhh this post is getting deleted. it's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.

*edit 5*

final edit. fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on reddit) how big of a dumbass i am.

thanks for everyone who said i'm not the asshole. i may have autism, but i'm not an asshole. 

*edit 6*

once again was wrong, /pinnacleclub what up

give me a couple days to sleep on releasing the video. i've got it, i've just got to convince my wife to release it. ",4
"update: i fucked up by not knowing the guy i like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass."". link to og post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

two months ago, i fucked up. i was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. i ended up realizing, not in a way that i wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab i work at. 

basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and i were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when i said, ""i would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" he overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. i was so fucking mortified. 

i didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. that didn't happen. on my first day back, i was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""oh fuck,"" i had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that i ought to apologize for my crass comment. but instead, i frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if i do that, he can't see me right? that didn't happen again. instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""hey my name, how was your break?"" 

i looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. he told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. he didn't bring up what happened either thank god. then he said something along the lines of, ""is that all your having for lunch?"" and i was like, ""uhm yeah, i was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

then he said, ""oh i was gonna go grab something to eat at a sandwich place near us, do you wanna come with?"" 

i was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. i tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so i said sure and we went. 

well. we ended up having a great lunch. inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""so tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think i spent staring at you?"" i literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""it has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? that has to mean i like you."" (btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

even with my shock, i managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

we have not done the butt stuff. he told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. looks like i will be retaining my butt virginity and i managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

tl;dr: despite my fuck up, it all worked out. we're celebrating one month together tomorrow! also, i'm a girl (got two comments asking if i was).

edit: yes, i accidentally wrote ""guess"" instead of ""guest."" my b, my b. ",4
"by genuinely forgetting i had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in amsterdam and getting caught.. so this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

i would freely and happily admit if i tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

came with a couple of friends for the weekend to amsterdam for a birthday. it's a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

i'm sure most people know the dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit 'coffee shops' and buy and smoke joints. 

had a fun party night last night in town. went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

in a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, i put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...'did i ditch that joint'?

at this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

'sir, do you have anything in your pockets' says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

holy. fucking. shit. what to do? i'm still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. do i come clean? no way-too late for that. got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. but, schiphol airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. i'm asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. i'm sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did i smoke that joint??? airport guys hands pats pocket. i feel object being pressed into hip. fuck fuck fuck. 

'sir, empty your pocket please'? says airport guy. my partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. in slow motion i see the penny drop on his face. i dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. i feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

i'm dying inside. i say to pat down guy, 'oh god. i'm really sorry, i forgot that was in th...'
'haha, sure, sure - thats what they all say'! laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

i'm placed to one side. customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, 'don't worry sir! don't look so scared! you are 20th today and you won't be last! i'm sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately i can't let you leave amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home'. 

i almost wept with relief. i was made to sign a form to say he'd taken joint off me....and that was it...

i'm in a bar in schiphol airport in amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. to all you dutch-bless your hearts. you're the best. i'm sorry i was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

tldr i was a hot mess and genuinely forgot i had a joint in my pocket. got caught with it. dutch customs were amazing about it. 

edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

edit 2, thanks for the shiny stuff. first awards (on a story about my drug use).  i'm from uk for those asking.. my flights just landed and i made it through uk customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. i've just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. it says under what was taken, 'joints'. 

edit 3-schiphol doesn't frisk as matter of routine, yes i get it. thanks for correction.",4
"by getting reddit banned in russia. today reddit was blocked in russia, and i am the one who posted this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b4_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b1%d1%8b/) which lead to this.

in russia, there is a law which allow roskomnadzor, russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. two years ago i tested how rkn react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. on of that websites was reddit.

one thing i learned is that rkn doesn't want to block popular websites. they respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. it was on 05/21/2013(https://img.bi/#/vn0xdfz!sufwaazuq0ogfp6njqpmgqpwensqfa4kln1gdqhz). on 10st aug 2015 they posted a call to help them contact reddit administration(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official vk page. funny thing, but they called psilocybe a plant. several hours ago they reported that reddit is blocked in russia(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). seems like things changed.

how reddit is blocked? fully. as reddit switched to https, there is no way to block special page.

will i remove this post? no. i also think that reddit administration needs to do nothing. this is important issue on freedom of speech, and only rkn want to violate it.

btw, this post is a guide for indoor growing psilocybe mushrooms in russian. i'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to rkn.

"by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans.  about three weeks ago, i began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who i'll call ""ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

we live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. he's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. i thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt i get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. they are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

i ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. i used his email on the sign-up so that i could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

one small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. i sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which i mean i entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. i simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. i know how to do this because i'm a brilliant hacker (i googled it).

while carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: a shipping confirmation for an engagement ring. i immediately noped off his computer, and of course i didn't open the email, but the damage is done. secret's out!

my heart fell right through my butt, you guys. i actually died and now i'm a ghost writing this.

i probably should have pretended i never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but i was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. within the hour i broke down and called ray to sheepishly confess what i had done. he wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that i spoiled the surprise. 

here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

my punishment for snooping is that the suspense is killing me. i've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

a romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, i thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""why would you think that i'm going to propose to you?"" he said. ""that sounds like something you wouldn't know about because i'd keep it secret in my personal email!""

now he's started intermittently faking me out. the other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. he keeps getting down on one knee... looking up at me... and saying, ""gotta tie this shoe!"" the emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is maddening. every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

one more thing: i somehow fucked up the email settings. the shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. so that surprise got spoiled, too. turns out i'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

i guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and i do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

if we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

she finds it funny. extremely funny. so funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. after a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. i asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, i start to reach for my phone.

turns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. whoops.

"by taking a picture of my wife's ass. this happened about a week ago.

after  a few minutes of mindless wandering, i notice her on the other side of  the store. i also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as i'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, i hear someone behind me shout ""hey creep! why are you  taking a picture of that girls ass!?"" i turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

i  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. my wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that i had to leave. she explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

the employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. honestly i'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. it was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

"by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.. so, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. one of the classes i was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. while the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. for our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. i did my paper on helium-3 power generation. i worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. the papers were due last night at midnight and i held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. this is where i fucked up big time.

let me tell you a little about myself. i don't work a normal job. i tried it in my first year of school and i really didn't like it. i've worked internships when they came up but outside of that i really didn't ""work"". this and being a student really doesn't mix well though. so, i had to make money some way. for the past 3 years i've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. specifically, for furries. i would write anything. any fetish, any premise, anything. in some parts of that community i became really popular. at one point i was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts i charged  to my customers. am i proud of this? no. i have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. i told myself the minute i got a ""real"" job i was cutting and running from this work.

well, this brings us to last night. i had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. i had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. i was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. i was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. i ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. however, instead of submitting my final paper, i somehow submitted one of the commissions i was working on. this commission is not light either. it is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

so, i went to bed. submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. when i woke up this morning i checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

i want to fucking die right now. i don't know how i'm going to explain why instead of my final i submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. but yeah, i fucked up big time.

tl:dr: in my final semester at college. instead of submitting my final research paper, i submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. professor ""want's to talk"" and i want to die.

&#x200b;

obligatory update:

well, i just left his office and i still want to die. not as much though. i took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  i won't lie, when i sat down with him i was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. i guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

i ran down pretty much everything i said here. while he didn't agree with the avenue i was taking to make money he understood why i was doing it.

he had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""customer\_commission\_2nd draft.doc""). i've taken a class from him before and was an a student so he guessed i had submitted the wrong file on accident. he told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

i gave him the copy i brought and he accepted it. he told me to email him the file and he would replace the one i had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" he seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what i had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

like i said. i still want to fucking die right now. at least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . thanks i guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",4
"by finding a flashdrive and looking what was on it.. i found a flashdrive in my home and was curious as to what was on it. i put it in the computer and find folders full of family pictures and a video. it was blurred in the thumbnail, so of course i have to play it. 

it all happened so fast.

i see a dick. a hard, throbbing cock, staring me right in the eye.

and then it's cumming.  

and after the last bit of cum drops, the camera gets aimed downward and i see my dad's shoes and the tile in our bathroom. 
i just watched my dad shoot his fucking load all over the bathroom tile. this dude filmed himself cumming in the bathroom. 

he moved out a long time ago and obviously forgot that this flashdrive was here. i'm not going to give it back. i'm not going to assert dominance and return the favor. i'm going to burn it with fucking fire. 

tl;dr: i met my siblings today.

"by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.. well, fuck. 

not a throwaway because i have no shame left to feel. 

by orgasming so many times i went blind in one eye. that's right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

seriously, though. last night i was trying to sleep (obligatory ""not technically today"") but failing miserably. i have bipolar disorder, i'm off my medication (that is a in itself), and i was in the early stages of a manic episode. for those who aren't batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. i tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my mothman musical, and thinking about al gore. at about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, i decided i had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

enter stage left lesbian porn. here's the part where i mention how my clit is made of steel. i came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. for some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. having finished the porn (which i actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) i decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. now, whenever i'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, i always have to go completely under the covers. unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where i live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? anyway, for some reason i can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. maybe saudi arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? since this incident i've only slept for four hours. i'm losing my mind. 

anyway, at this point i'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. after ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. my clit breathes a sigh of relief and i emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. my right eye is stinging a little bit, and i realise the acne treatment i'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. i grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

i'm sure you can see where this is going, but i certainly didn't. and now i could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. i wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. the weird angle i'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. for some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. i felt genuinely betrayed. like, how dare you? you did this to me. this is your fault. et tu, clite? 

once my eye starts to swell up, i call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. arguably the weirdest walk of shame i've ever done. 

i continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. the swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. my eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

now i've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that i'll probably have to cancel. i've been wanting to bang this guy for weeks. also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and i can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish i'm shit out of luck. 

tl;dr: i masturbated and now i'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

edit: sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? this blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if i wrote it. damn my unforgettable mothman musical. anyway, i did not cancel my dick appointment. i told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (less endearing when i got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. i've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. hallelujah.

edit #2: clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. to clarify: i'm bi. also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, i guess.",4
"by letting my son take my wife's menstrual cup for show and tell. my wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. sometime over the weekend i noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. i asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it's versatility- over the next few days it helped the paw patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. it came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. i loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

fast forward to this morning and as we're getting ready for school alexa reminds us that it's show and tell today at school. so my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. i pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. my son looks happy so i figure he's not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he's proud of. 

our conversation:

teacher: ben's show and tell was...interesting. 

me: yea! it's cool right? we've been playing with that thing for days. 

teacher: uh, mr. scott, do you know what that is?

i start to panic- oh shit it's not a toy...

teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

i get confused. 

teacher notes my confusion: it's um, used to collect menstrual blood...

i'm still confused...

teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

me: it just...stays in there? 

she nods. 

me: are you sure? i don't think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

we're both clearly uncomfortable. 

me: alright then.....so where do i get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


my wife laughed hysterically when we told her. my son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

tl:dr thought my wife's menstrual cup was a toy and my son and i played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

edit: wow!!!! i cannot believe this got so much attention. i'm glad everyone got a good laugh. a bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn't know it was me, though. 

my wife has been reading the comments and insisted that i clarify that i know all about her cycle. we are ttc currently and, just as it was with our son, i know when she's ovulating, i track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. i grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices i was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. i was also confused by it ""fitting"" because, like i said, this device helped save a chickoletta over the weekend. i've seen a tampon- they're much slimmer than this cup is. my wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn't even feel it's presence after it's im position. 

i'd like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife's approval.",4
"by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think i was a heroin junkie. ever since i was a kid, i loved to fiddle around with staplers. playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. one of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. there are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes i'd break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. i've even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200b;

this progressed from me messing around with staples in ms. grady's second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. i had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? well...

&#x200b;

fast forward to present day. i am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. i have a home, a normal car, an office job. i am by all accounts a normal human being... **i still love staples.** working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. i'd spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. it got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200b;

so i had to stop doing that...i turned to amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. it wasn't enough. i went to 20, then 40. my wife got curious then and asked ""why are you buying all of these boxes of staples"". but i brushed it off as a work issue that i'd get reimbursed for and knew i had to change my methods.

&#x200b;

over the course of a few months i enabled myself...i started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. i would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. i began to stay out late and tell my wife i would be home soon, so i could go buy more staples from different stores. i opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn't know but she caught it in the mail. she got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200b;

this past thursday after one of my ""late nights"" i get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. i walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. because it is.

&#x200b;

my wife asked if there was anything i wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. i sat down and kept saying ""what are you talking about"" until my mom said ""honey, we saw the pictures"". then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. this man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me ""do something"" with what i had in the bag from multiple stores. it basically looked like i was a drug runner for office depot who was using some of the product for myself. at this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. i had to come clean and all i could muster was

&#x200b;

""i...i like staples.""

&#x200b;

the wtf looks i got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when i showed them my car....i came clean. i backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. right now my only concern is my dad. he didn't laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200b;

believe it or not, i think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. i may or may not do that, but the good news is i now can have a ""staple hour"" once i get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200b;

tldr: i have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought i was on drugs when it became a problem.

edit: 

thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! i am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. if you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, i just ask that you dm me/name the throwaway so i can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people's perspectives on my problem.

1. i went to see a therapist today with my wife. i was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, i do need help. i am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. just tailored to my specific issue.

2. apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. that included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. so after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. my wife initially thought i was having an affair. she didn't think i was doing drugs until she got the pictures. the pi just told her what he saw, and she deduced that i had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. she admitted that she didn't think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. i do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. i am just an addict, and an idiot. i know how stupid the addiction is and so i tried to hide it. it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things i guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",4
"tifu by sending my wife a random dick pic. so this afternoon my wife was out at the pharmacy that's less than three minutes from our house.  she called because our insurance card wasn't working and asked for the numbers on the new cards we had just been issued. i started to read the numbers to her but she interrupted saying it would just be easier if i took a picture. to be funny i included my man parts in the photograph.  when she got home, i asked her how she liked the picture i had sent. she seemed genuinely clueless and didnt know what i was talking about.  apparently she just handed the phone with the picture open to the pharmacist to grab the numbers off himself. 

tl;dr: sent my wife a dick pic with insurance info that she  subsequently showed to the pharmacist at our local grocery store.  ",4
"by destroying the entirety of my family for only $99. throwaway account.

we've all been seeing the recent craze of dna testing and whatnot, so my dad and i decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. we got our results back a few days ago and i went into the dna relatives section to check out my matches. at the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% dna with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. this didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. my cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. we're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

i couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what i was seeing and i had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. the only realistic explanation for what i was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. all the dots lined up and i felt a sense of *loss*. i sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then i had a feeling of anger come over me. i needed some fucking answers. 

without even thinking, i rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. my mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. she had no idea my dad and i had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. my mother and i never had a 'traditional' relationship. she was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

my irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. i asked her if she cheated on dad with uncle david (name changed for obv reasons). i have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. she looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""what kind of question is this? of course not."" i told her everything; the test, percentages, dna matches, all of it!! shit hit the fan. my mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

i left her there and went back into my room. i called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. she ended the call screaming. dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. i told him everything too. he didn't say anything after calming down. he left the room and i locked the door. 

for the next few hours, i heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. my parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. my aunt in law and david showed up shortly later and i'm pretty sure i heard my dad and david get into some physical fight. utter chaos. 

i feel like fucking shit. ik it's not my fault but i can't help feeling that this is all because of me. if i had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. i'm too scared to go outside. i don't even know what the outcome was. the only noise i hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and i sure my dad is out of the house. fuck my life

tldr; mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. i take a dna test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. i've locked myself in my room and i'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

"by leaving thc chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles. my cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of thc chocolate for christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. my parents are 75-year old republicans. that was a big maybe.

&#x200b;

well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. you put half a candy bar down and yoink, gone when you come back.

&#x200b;

you can guess what happened. my mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. her last words, high as a kite, were ""i think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200b;

they took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. at which point i assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the redbull orbit jumper.

&#x200b;

anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. so now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

tl;dr - mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

obligatory gold edit: thanks all for your well wishes! ! a few things to clear up - mom went into the hospital on saturday. as of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in manhattan where she awaits surgery details. i'm in canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but i'm planning to head back down to ny this weekend to be with her. also....op is not a dude. :)

second update from my dad: mom's surgery may be thursday, with the holidays and all. i decided not to mention that i put the story on the internet.

fp edit - thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. i'm headed back to the states on thursday, the tentative surgery date. will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

update - mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. all of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

check out my adorable mom

"by saying i was tired to my wife.. came home from the gym. its leg day. had full day at work too. work isn't bad. came home to happy kids. wife does a great job at keeping them alive. the best. had to take a shower before bed. wife says hurry because shes tired. i empathize by saying i will hurry because i am also tired. bad idea. wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. i do not dispute this since i am not a total moron. kids are exhausting but totally worth it. i tell her as much. she is most tired. i am only kind of tired. not good enough. she is more tired. i agree with this in order to ease the tension. unsuccessful. she is fully triggered by the fact that i had the audacity to say that i was tired. there is no escape. am screwed. 


tldr: am not allowed to be tired. ever.

"by being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. nsfw. well, this didn't happen today. but it's a funny story that i couldn't share with reddit at the time.

rewind back to me at 14 years old. awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

as such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

one night, to avoid watching tv with my dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, i claimed that i had ""homework"" to do. of course, this was a lie. i just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

so i fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

now this is where things went wrong. i got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

you see, my bedroom was upstairs and i had no door. a sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my dad, his wife, and her two kids were watching tv. 

the desktop was right next to the staircase, but i figured that the tv was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. i was right.

but what i didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

i also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

i eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

and that's when i turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that i was casting a giant shadow puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. a perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. and i had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

so i did what anyone would do in that situation. i put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until i heard the tv come back on. then i went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

no one ever brought it up. and i'm thankful. but i know what they saw. and i'm still cringing.

tl;dr: got horny. got stupid. projected a masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. still embarrassed.

edit: well shit. glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.

edit: holy fuck lmao. i'm proud and ashamed of how much yall liked this.",4
"by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend. i have grapheme-color synesthesia. basically i see letters and numbers in colors. the letter 'e' being green for example. a couple months ago i was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. he asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what i said a few months ago. always being the sameish as course. he still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe i just memeroized them really really well.

tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. i tried explaining to him i just see the colors automatically when i visualize the letters in my head. i asked him what colour are the letters in his head. he looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

my boyfriend didnt understand what i meant by visualizing the letters. he didn't believe me that i can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. when he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. he can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. he thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... its crazy to him the fact that i can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

now i have a boyfriend that is really upset. he feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. he's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing i wasnt pulling his chain. hes pretty upset and i feel really bad. 

tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (cant visualize anything at all)

edit; oh wow this blew up. i just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. he never thought i was lying. i think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",4
"by ruining a joke my wife has been saving for years.. tomorrow i'll be turning 32.  as we were waking up this morning she asked me if i was excited for the plans we'd made for my birthday. i responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but i was looking forward to it nonetheless.

she looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. i thought she was just trying to make sense of what i had said. instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that i ruined a joke she's been holding onto for years. i didn't believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn't forget. 

it took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. unfortunately for her i've known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.

i go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. obviously they do, but whatever. so i start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think i'll steal it i guess. i go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. i realize i don't know my boyfriends number by heart so i just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. he doesn't. i use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when i call.

i resort to explaining to everyone whose phone i ask to use my situation. some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and i was just being modest. it's been about 2 hours now. the store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, i'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

a cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. i explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. she tells me i can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. i ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. we're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. i just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. and there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

he said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized i wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. and that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. he thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

edit: i understand ifu by not relaying my need to pee.
also that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. also have never heard of this last man on earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. i have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened irl.

"by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life. this is long so tldr at the bottom.

this happened around 6 years ago when i was in 9th grade. i grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. my parents never taught me anything about genitals and i apparently never asked, all i knew was that's where the pee came out.

so one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. i was pretty shocked because that's certainly not how mine worked. by that time i was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

so armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work i went home and a few google searches led me to discover that i had a severe case of phimosis. so being the pragmatic young buck that i am i also google how to fix it. there were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel i opted for the latter option. i got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom's bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

after about 4 hours of stretching i finally started making some progress! i could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell i've ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. it dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. i kept stretching over the course of a few days and i started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as i stretched. some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as dick cheese. 

i cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. that was about to change real fucking fast.

so this was about 10 days into my stretching and i'd gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. i was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so i got very impatient and i decided i'd try to force it all the way back that day i lubed and got to work, i pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. i pulled it till i couldn't bear the pain anymore. i did this over and over again for around 3 hours until i somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. i got way too excited and despite the pain i gave it one big yank and i felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. it hurt like hell but i was just so relieved that i didn't care. i opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. the entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. that was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where i tore the top part of my foreskin when i yanked it over the glans. i freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. it eventually stopped and then i had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. i eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. i was still hurting but i was finally done. i got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. i thought that was it. i tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn't budge so i just left it.i completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. you know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? that's how my penis looked. i went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

when i got home i was still in major pain so i decided i'd check on it. i undressed in the shower and looked down at it. the first thing i saw were the blisters. two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. the next thing i noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. i'm a black guy.

i realized that if i didn't find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. i lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. this was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. i kept trying to force it back over and i put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  my penis was on fire at this point and i was holding back tears but i kept pushing until i felt it pop back over the glans. judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain i felt i guess the second blister popped too. once again i left it and fucking went to bed. 

i checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. i rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks i was pretty much ok. my foreskin was still tight and i do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. even if they aren't as stupid as i was don't take that risk lol

tl;dr; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because i got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn't get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

edit: so i didn't expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

so while i'm happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, i'd like to clear up something. this post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  rather, i'd like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

for those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. don't be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. they have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. for those of you who aren't old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. believe me it's not as awkward that you think. don't risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like.

"by c*mming so hard i fainted. so this happened a couple of days ago..

had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. after changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, i went to visit a dermatologist. anyways, turns out i have a skin condition called pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. so she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. after showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and i sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. i noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back reaalllyyy good. so naturally i took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. naturaly i decided to take it to the next logical level: flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (yes i know this sounds mildy retarded). what ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. i busted a nut so hard i started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and i fucking fainted. my parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a reaaal worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. so yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. fml

tl;dr: found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided i wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. came so hard i went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

i'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol

edit: wow i had no idea this would blow up like this! thanks for the golds, silvers and platinum kind strangers!

"by tipping my pizza delivery driver $1100. so today i sold my bitcoin i bought 2 years ago i spent like $100 on the investment or something, i cashed it out at a bitcoin atm and brought it home the first thing i did to celebrate was buy some edibles. i buy some edibles eat a whole brownie and am out of it, i order some pizza and take some money from my wad and put it in a pile on the table next to me total was like 20 so i put 23.

since i'm high af the pizza delivery girl knocks i grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. i give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this is going to help me. freaked out and high i say okay and just rush inside.

right now after waking up being passed out i realize what i've done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.

tl;dr - i tipped my pizza delivery driver $1100 while high on brownie edibles by accident and have no money to pay for my bills now

edit: thanks for all the nice comments and the reddit gold kind stranger. i just woke up and this post just blew up. i could never call the pizza place and ask for the money back, with how happy it made the women and the fact it was my own dumb mistake it just wouldn't feel right in my head, i would rather be late on my bills and figure anything else out then do that.

i just want to say thank you to u/misterchief117 who helped me out in a insane way, i really don't deserve how nice some people in this world are.",4
"i hooked up with a guy in my airport hotel room this morning before checking out. turns out he is on the same flight as me and guess what, he's traveling with his wife and kids.. i know reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. this morning i was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. so i got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. so i said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. after 45min to an hour of fun, i thought i'd never see this dude again because i'm flying home this afternoon (right now).

wrong. i went to the gate when they started boarding. guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? you guessed it. to make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and i can hear all their conversations. i'm in the plane right now and he keeps texting. i am saving screen shots in case i need them in the future. i'm sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

this is so uncomfortable.

tl;dr: hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. turns out he's married, and he and his family are on my flight home.

edit: i gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. he texted me just now telling me he found me on ig and fb so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. now i definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.

edit 2: a) i'm male. b) the wife does not know. he texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. and then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet i saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) c) i knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies

just wanted to respond to popular questions.

"by not taking off my apple watch or disabling the 911 feature and accidentally called police while i was handcuffed and being spanked by my husband and the police heard me screaming.. to begin, i'm a female bdsm practitioner. i enjoy it, and i won't apologize. (edit: that came out harsh. i'm sorry)

my husband often cuffs and whips me, and on wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. he put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my apple watch. i didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

so we get into it, and he's spanking me and i'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly i hear from my watch ""ma'am, i hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. we are sending someone to you. hold tight."" 

""did you call 911???"" my husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

so i tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name she said my name here? and i say yes... and she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

i said okay thank you, and i hung up.

""the police are coming.""

shit. i'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. we put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

i calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. i didn't mention the spanking.

apparently my husband did. another police officer comes in and asks about our bdsm contract. ""he told you about our contract?""

""he felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show state of mind.""

i go get our contract and showed it to the officers. after a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the apple watch if we're going to do that again.

tl;dr by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy bdsm session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.

edit: iwatch doesn't exist. <3

edit: this post is not deja vu. yes. i posted it 2 days ago, and mods took it down, asking me to repost it today. the literally hundreds of people asking about if they saw this before need to read this edit. they took it down because this happened on wednesday, and according to the rules of the subreddit, sexual content is not allowed except for on weekend, so they asked me to repost it today.

edit: holy shit. thanks for the gold!! and the front page. i'm freaking out a little because contrary to the trolls, yes this happened.",4
"by texting my pregnant wife that ""this isn't working"". my wife posted earlier today on la about this. not using my main because my fil knows it and i'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

i went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. i had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when i turned it on. most of them were asking how i could do this. i had no clue what she was talking about. she didn't answer any of my calls back.

i got home and she was packing up to leave. i'll admit it, i cried. a lot. had no clue what was happening or what i did. finally, it comes out that i texted her that i wanted a divorce. she showed me the text and i immediately realize what happened.

this morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. i texted her ""the new mirror came in! i'm going to try to put it together but i may need your help later"". i had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. i texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point i think i need to just give up"". apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. so my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while i was off thinking everything was great. she even called a divorce lawyer.

things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. she told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

tl;dr accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.

edit: wow, this blew up. to address a few things that came up in the comments:

\-i usually work from home unless i need to meet with clients. i don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. that's why she didn't know i was at work yesterday. i'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. if my phone goes off, i could lose my job, and our health insurance.

\-my wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. that's why she had the reaction she did.

\-my comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. neither of us is mad at the other. this was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. we're fine. i posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. no need to psychoanalyze my wife or pm me about divorce. we are fine.

\-and no, we haven't put the mirror together yet. we weren't really in a ""home improvement"" mood last night.",4
"by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door. throwaway account because obviously.

my boyfriend and i are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. we got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. we're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. i started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so i figured on going to completion. unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

so there i am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. his mom comes in! i freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

anyways, it's 5:40am, i've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

tl;dr: bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

update @7:31am - thanks for all the reassuring comments. my bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. more to come.

update @8:38am - of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... anyways thanks! so breakfast started off totally fine. i mean, yeah i was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. that is, until i excused myself to go shower. she stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. but then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". it was sweet and cringy all at once. i guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

update: a lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. actually i assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); i didn't actually see her do it. i asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while i was...ehm...cleaning.",4
"by realizing that my ceiling fan has been making my bedroom a sauna for 11 years. i've been living in this house for the past 11 years. in my bedroom there's a ceiling fan that i always have on to try and make my room colder. my room has always been insanely hot compared to the rest of the house and i never understood why.

flash forward to today when i'm talking to a friend that said they found out their fan can switch directions to heat the room in the winter. i immediately realized my fuck up. when i got home i took a closer look at the fan and hiding by the light is a little black switch. i hit the switch and what do you know, my room is about 10 degrees colder in minutes. i've been sleeping in a sauna for the past 11 years and had no idea. every day in the summer waking up sweaty was because of a tiny black switch.

tldr: my ceiling fan has been spinning the wrong direction and heating my room for 11 sweaty years",4
"by taking lsd and pretending to be french for 10 months. throwaway for reasons.
tl;dr at the bottom.

so this was more of a fu that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

about 11 months ago i moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until i could get the money together to sort something out properly, i was hoping to have already moved out by this point. on my second day after i'd finished unpacking i decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, i'd brought some with me that i'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and i quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than i had been told they were, and i thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. so i figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because i was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

so i left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. it's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. i'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. she said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

so basically i do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where i pretend i can't speak english. i remember a few words from my gcse french so i just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. in the state i was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and french just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. my exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and i shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. she pretty much just left me to it after that and i got on my way. i did my walk and got home about two hours later, i was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. when i got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. i tried to keep my head down because i couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so i instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. when i got in i started freaking out straight away because i realised that i'd just become french and now two of the neighbours think i can't speak any english. the next day when i woke up i realised the best thing i could do (as an englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be french for seemingly no reason. 

fast forward 10 months, i still live here, and at this point i'm in deep. my life on this street is a web of lies. i've perfected my french accent and over the course of 10 months french me has learnt a decent amount of english so he can hold disjointed conversation.
i'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and i was the nice quirky french guy on the street. i didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation i had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered i wasn't french. if i had friends come over (i don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. most of them found it amusing, at least. 

things were going okay and i wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because i'd gotten so used to it. i'm not home that much and when i am i rarely leave the house for any reason so i only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when i was out on my street. if anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when i got to take on my french persona. french me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his english was a bit limited.

but then there was the day it all came crashing down. i was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her i didn't recognise. she stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy i was telling you about"". you might be able to see where this is going. 

her friend hits me with a question in french that i didn't understand a word of, and i knew he was actually french straight away because his accent was way better than mine. i didn't know what to do and i just froze. every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause i just decided i had to come clean. i told her i wasn't actually french and couldn't speak french and then i tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke i'd been doing on everyone. nobody was buying that. i fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

i haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which i'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. i make sure nobody is around now whenever i leave the house, and i do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when i get home so that i never come into contact with them. every time i think about the day i was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

tl;dr: pretended to be french to avoid human interaction on lsd, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a french man.

edit: i didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and i'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. some people seem to have a hard time believing that i thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, i'd like to remind people that when i made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",4
"by making my boyfriend a tinder account. okay so necessary this actually happened in the last couple of weeks. basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. 

obviously i think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though i've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. so, for some stupid reason, i decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. i set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

after a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after i showed this to him, i saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

queue my surprise when a couple of days later i check the tinder account i had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and i could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

i confronted him and he denied it but i mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity i checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. so now the tinder i made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

tl;dr: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

edit: wow i did not expect this to blow up! thank you so much for the gold and silver and for your kind, kind words. it honestly touches me how absolutely lovely thousands of strangers can be. 

also, if anyone needs help with their tinder, hmu lol because i'm apparently pretty good at it.

"by matching with my homophobic uncle on grindr. so i have an uncle (we will call him j) who has always been very vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. there is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

well this weekend in between family gatherings i was looking to meet somebody . i started chatting with an older man because that's how i roll. a lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so i don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. we actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics i wish i could unsee and sending a few i wish i could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

so i'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . it is at this moment i realize my fu, i've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  he tried to play it off like a random encounter but i wasn't letting him get away with that. after some pressing he finally admits that he is the man i've been talking to and i told him i don't judge him like he does me . he apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

he kept talking with me like he was still interested and i had to make it clear that was not going to happen . i had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him i had to go ahead and block his number. i can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

always get a face pic, people.

tl:dr: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . should have insisted on the face pic

edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but i'll answer some pressing questions . i did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who i was . it is pretty disturbing to say the least. as far as blackmail goes i have everything saved but i don't plan on doing anything with it as i think that could actually put me in danger . this man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

edit 2: this was fake . reddit is gullible and i fucking hate . it's all fake stories just like twoxchromosomes . get baited . ama https://www.reddit.com/r/ama/comments/bgvj1e/i_made_the_front_page_with_50k_upvotes_yesterday/",4
"by telling a stranger i can't wait to fuck them tonight. disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. i only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, ""what was your most embarrassing moment?""

so i was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing i would get fully sloshed at the party. she was right.

on the way home, i ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. she pulls her light blue jeep into the parking lot, i stumble out of the jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

i (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. ""i can't wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.""

i was not expecting to get hit in the face. i also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming i've ever heard in my life. instinctively, i covered up my face and wondered what the hell i said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

the screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so i couldn't really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when i heard, clear as a bell, ""you fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.""

whoa whoa whoa instant sobriety. i uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although i was in a blue jeep, it was not my gfs blue jeep. my gfs identical blue jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman's blue jeep. 

i finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. she convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. 

i did not fuck anyone that night. 

tl;dr: drunkenly got into the wrong car, assumed the driver was my gf, and told her i was going to fuck her",4
"by sending a video without watching it and now i am being adopted.  so last thursday night i saw everyone tagging their step dads in the budweiser commercial. without watching it, i sent it to my stepdad. about an hour later my step dad and mom call me and ask if i'm hinting at something. my step dad is like i know you had intent. i'm like huh??? omg in the commercial the adult children are asking their stepdads to adopt them. so he starts crying, thinking i want this. now i can't tell him that i didn't mean to. friday he squeezed me so tight and said he wants me take his name and make it official. etc etc. all i can think is wow that sounds like a huge hassle. but i can never say anything about it being an accident. so like now i'm being adopted and changing my name. 

tl/dr sent a fathers day commercial to my stepdad who is adopting me now. i'm 31!",4
"by making my wife think i killed myself. right off the bat i want to say that i am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. this was not a prank gone wrong, or something i did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. burner for reasons.

&#x200b;

this happened a couple of weeks ago. i tripped and sprained my ankle. it's been bothering me enough that i've been taking epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. in addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, i also find it incredibly relaxing. say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, i enjoy a good soak.

&#x200b;

i also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. it's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...i call them old man spots. they're harmless, and most of the time i don't even notice, but every once in a while...i'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. additionally it takes foreverrr to get the bleeding to stop...its not like i can elevate my balls, let alone put a band aid on...

&#x200b;

well...on the day in question, i get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. so, i get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. it's not really important how i did it, but i ended up nicking one of those spots. so, after cursing a reasonable amount, i start the lengthy ritual of holding tp against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. even after the bleeding stops i have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...well i finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. i put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&#x200b;

 i wasn't asleep but i was really zoned out and relaxed...until i was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. i've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. it scared the shit out of me, and i jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. i shouted ""honey? what the fuck!""  she didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  it took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""jesus christ!"".....i could see what it must look like to her... i had apparently not stopped the bleeding as well as i thought i had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&#x200b;

it took me a long time to calm her down, and i don't think that's something you just get over. hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though i thought i had. took a bath, zoned out. wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact i was bleeding into the water and thought that i had killed myself. sorry honey.

"by relaxing too much during a sensual massage. bit of back story. i started talking to a guy on reddit last week. we hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. we decided to meet for a date on friday. i have ibs and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. i was also very tired.

the fu: so i'm at this guy's house and i've made us a very nice mac n cheese. there was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. we're then snuggling on the sofa and i feel a big fart brewing. i'm hoping i can just absorb it back in to my body if i hold on to it long enough. 

we start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. i choose a 'relaxing' oil. i'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. he starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. i'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

i then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart i have ever expelled. the fart i was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. it was hella loud and it was hella long. and it was right on his balls. it was so forceful, they vibrated.

his response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'at least you didn't shit yourself'.

tldr: farted on a first date's balls.

edit: for anybody interested, the mac n cheese is a very tasty recipe for those on a fodmap diet. you can replace pretty much all elements for low fodmap alternatives - gluten free pasta, lactofree milk and cheese, asafoetida for onion and garlic oil for garlic!",4
"a marriage.  obligatory this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

 so i sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. i live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... so common that i sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.

 one particular day i dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that i had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. so as we arrive i mention this to the rider:

me - hey i just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

rider- no, must be the wrong house

me- nope, he walked right out of that side door. i dropped him off at *names local bar* his girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (i had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) you guys having a family/friend vacation?

rider- this is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. nobody lives here but me and my wife and i've been in ny for work for the past 4 days. 

awkward silence as we both come to the realization. 

he got out and i drove away scolding myself for having such a big mouth. 

tldr- i may have ruined a marriage by trying to make small talk with my big mouth

* edit- thanks for all of the support guys! i know i did nothing wrong, i just hate being involved in other people's businesses, especially when it's so negative. 

 also - thanks for the silver and platinum awards!",4
"by stumbling on my 19 y/o sons reddit and reading through it.. dear lord. on my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so i clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  i click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

this is my sons account. it has to be. the comment he posted is about something that happened while i was there. he had a more detailed post about that specific day. he had another previous post about an event in his life i knew about and knew some details about. he had a few other posts which i also read. 

i now know what gets him going sexually. not something i needed to know.

i know what his girlfriend likes sexually. also, not something i needed to know. also quite surprising. 

i know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. i feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

i know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife's room.

in reading through the comments he's made to others, i've learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. i feel very proud about that.

overall, i wish i never clicked that first comment. i know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

tl;dr. accidentally discovered my son on reddit. found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, i shouldn't have read all of it. and some posts i stayed away from. and honestly, i didn't realize it right-right away. the first post i read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. it was after another that i really put the pieces together. and yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. but hey, life isn't always fair. i also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything i read.**",4
"by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards. this actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. in 2016 i started using tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. i had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. my profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of ""not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices"" and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

fast forward to march of 2017 and i matched with someone. after a couple of one-off messages that don't really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. a couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. this all sounds great. except for two problems.

the first problem is that i have a beard in all of my photos. and even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. my facial hair is like if someone shaved a guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. if i grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. wiry and sparse. it's not good. for six years, i'd still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. but for some reason, the week before we started talking, i had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. i just wanted to know what it looked like. the answer? not. fucking. good. at this point, i was 27 but still looked young for my age. shave the beard off and i look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. really fucking awkward.

so i pulled up to her house and text before i got out of my car to say, ""hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it's just me."" luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as i expected. all good so far.

i went inside and we end up hanging out all night. she cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. she was blown away by the fact that i'd never seen labyrinth and demanded we watch it. we ended up watching three movies that night. for labyrinth, i was about five feet away on the couch. for young frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. for the third movie (which i can't remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. and this is where the second problem comes in. 

after my breakup in 2016 and realizing i'd been battling lifelong depression, i started taking antidepressants. one of the super fun side effects of ssris is that it can be really hard to climax. like, try as you might, nothin. dust. moths. nothin. thanks, big pharma.

and so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like ""holy fuck i might have a heart attack. why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and ""what about this position?"" ""ouch!"" ""oh my god, i need a towel. so. much. sweat. i can't see."" we were in the basement on a large three piece couch. you know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. well at one point i tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. a bruised ass. a bent dick. a lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

if this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven't done any cardio in your fucking life. and jesus christ the sweat. so fucking slippery and gross. this wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. this is bog monsters come to life sweat. this is ace ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. at one point our chests become suction cupped together. i could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn't felt like it was going to explode. and the chafing. fuck. no matter how ready either of y'all are when you start out, after two hours, it's gonna wear off. we both felt like we'd attacked our bits with sandpaper. my poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. this was no climactic movie sex scene. this was a john waters film come to life. 

well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. it's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. we went outside for a smoke and at this point it's about 6am. i'm wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she's only in a bathrobe. we sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (she had just moved back home before finding a new place). so not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now i get to meet her mom for the first time! great! i'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. life is fucking weird.

well, the reason i am posting this on march 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we're engaged to be married on march 14th of 2020. our sex life is far better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. i mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

tl;dr i met up with a tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. now we're engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




edit: just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! i am still wholly undecided if i will ever show her this post. it's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. we'll see though. and thank you so much for the gold and silver! did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. and for those asking, i've changed my dosage on my ssri and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! and also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. he didn't pan out. within three months, her mom got hit up by several tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

edit2: i guess now i probably have to show this to my fiancee to which she will reply, ""i have no idea what any of that means. good for you, i guess?"" i still love her.

edit3: a few of y'all keep asking, ""why in tifu?"" well, let me tell ya, if i had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. even worse than my breakup the year before. not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? yeah, that sucked. just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't suck asssss on the whole. i mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. thanks for coming to my tedtalk

final edit: for real y'all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. i told her about this post when i got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when i read it to her. we spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift drive-thru theater setup",4
"by complimenting a girl's skirt. happened a couple weeks ago

i was at a party and saw a girl across the room. she was wearing a skirt, holding a drink in one hand and had the other hand in her pocket. i saw her skirt, thought to myself how cool that skirt is having pockets. a lot of women i know complain about not having pockets, so this is a very progressive thing.

a bit later, i got around to talking to her. i complimented her skirt, and how pockets in a skirt is great. she looked very confused, said ""my skirt doesn't have pockets, why would you think that?"" i mentioned that i had seen her earlier with her hand in her pocket. her face went bright red and revealed that her hand was amputated. what i thought was her hand in her pocket, was her stump resting against her hip.

i apologised immediately, but luckily she thought it was funny because she'd never heard that comment before. i'm still dying inside though.

tl dr; complimented a girl on having a skirt with pockets, turns out she just didn't have a hand.",4
"by accidentally asking my wife's sister for a three way.. this fuck up mainly involves three people me m32, my wife f27 and her sister f25.

so for context a normal saturday is for my wife and i to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

this week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

so off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our saturdays.

as we are about to leave her sister says ""have fun"" in a cheeky way which i completely don't pick up on.

my brain decides that as my wife and i spent thursday together for valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

so straight after the ""have fun"" and without consulting my wife, i say ""you can tag along if you like""

the atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and i'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so i double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""as you said it will be fun"".

my wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when i've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

i've apologised and explained. i know we will laugh about it later but for now i'm playing lego lotr on my own. 

tl:dr i asked my wife's sister for a three way without realising sisters talk about the things they do.

edit: well this post went nuclear! oh and thanks for the golds kind strangers. 

a couple of things i'd like to address, many of you seem to think its bad we don't spend saturday with our kids. well i work from home 4 days a week and my wife is a stay at home mom. our kids are not yet school age so it's nice for us to have time as a couple on a saturday.

yes, i spelt invite as invight, oh well.

as for an update, lego lotr is now being played two player!

thanks all.",4
"by not telling my wife our son was coming home. this happened sunday night.



my oldest son is in the marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  he took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  at first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. when it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  i tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



i get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  he gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his dress blues.  now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



we discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  we go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  we settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... free internet points and all that......



i walk in and the house is quiet.  no one in the living room.  a little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



what i did not know was the entire time i was gone, my wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  she got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



so no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to surprise her.  a handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  the text told my son to stay outside.  i had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



so my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  i told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  the look of confusion on her face was priceless.  it took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, there was our son in his dress uniform and she was estatic.  the noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  it goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess will have to suffice instead.




tl;dr  didn't tell wife that marine son was coming home, missed out on sexy times and the second half of the packers/falcons game



edit 1: goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.

update: wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  she is worried that this story will end up in one of her marine moms fb groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.    son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.

"by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.. i'm in my third year of university taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. to start the semester i ended up missing the first week of school because i was on a last minute trip with my friends. it was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since i technically couldn't afford to go.

anyway, i came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. on both those days i have classes all day until 2pm so i usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. so my first tuesday home i ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. so as part of my degree i have to take microeconomics which all i knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. when i get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so i just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

this goes on for 3.5 weeks. i came to class. took notes. then did the weekly assignments. on the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is febuary 1st. so the class before the exam, january 30th, i decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. now i was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was all theory based while the class was heavy math based. i understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. i explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*explains above about material*
prof: ""what do you mean theory? all the assignments are filled with math. are you using launchpad?""
me: ""no the assignments are online. like the website we bought the textbook from. whats lauchpad?""
prof: ""pardon? i don't have a textbook for this course.""
me: ""it literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*shows syllabus*
prof: ""wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
me: ""what do you mean...? this is econ 202 right?""
*prof starts laughing*
prof: ""haha this is econ 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. this is a new one, i've never experienced this before.""
me: ""well this is awkward. i better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

i then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. i caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. even showed him my econ 301 notes to prove i couldn't make this shit up. he just laughed and said the same thing ""this is a new one for me."" turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. same with the midterms. they were relevant because it was obviously a level above what i was supposed to be doing and the only thing i got wrong was the building code. they were both classroom 112, just different buildings. so basically i just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. wish me luck tomorrow!

tldr; i was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until i finally realized. then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. crazy coicidences all around.

edit: well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""you made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". the exam is in a couple hours and i will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but i had fun and went to tiesto's birthday in vegas amongst other kool stuff. life goes on.

2. i was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and i had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). so i do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. he did everything on the board and there were online notes but i figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. i highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. it's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. i've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so i'm sure it will turn out fine. it'll be a funny story at grad when i get my ring.

thanks for all the support too. :) making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

edit 2: just got back from the exam.. i didn't crush it but there is no way i didn't pass. it was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. the prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""i usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm i will take the average to make up that first exam."" so all in all i survived and live to fight another day.

just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. i will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. in the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. but somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - cz

"during my first surgery as a 3rd year medical student. 
i'm a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship ""assisting"" on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. in this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. if you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. as this was my first laparoscopic surgery, i soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. like many of you, i had no idea this role even existed, but i quickly accepted my new job as 'vagina sealer'. i approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. i placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. after several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  the attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said ""do you know where the vagina is? get that stopper out of her ass!""

thank you for reading. i'll go die now. 

tl;dr  couldn't see under the sterile drapes when placing a rubber stopper in the vagina during surgery and accidentally placed it in the rectum",4
"by letting my girlfriends dad use my laptop nsfw. so today i had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, i'm still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn't make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story i'm 27 and i live with my girlfriend, we've been together for 2 years now and through out that time i've seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they're usually travelling so it's a little harder to spend time with them. now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and i for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. we've also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

so on top of making porn i'm also an aspiring film editor and i am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but i also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us i'd been editing a new video, usually after editing i go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because i'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. we were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, i immediately said sure and led him into the office, now i could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and i kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. so i lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as i opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst i ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

i panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and i are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but i hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and i'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



tl;dr i unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

update: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so i'll explain, as i said earlier in the post i watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep i just shut the laptop without even thinking, i do this often (i know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. still haven't heard from her dad yet. i honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and i laugh a lot so thank you

update 2: thank you all for participating in a social experiment stay tuned",4
"deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.. the update!!(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200b;

ohhhhh where do i begin. this happened this weekend.

let's lay out some plot points first..

\-i'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. she is 26.

\-i work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. i've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-i've always worked out, done yoga, i'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. this combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. i've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. i know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, i've done it a lot and i know what i'm doing, lol.

&#x200b;

okay. so, the girl i am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. one of whom is getting married soon. she was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. i was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? i agree to the plan. i was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200b;

there are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. this way, i would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. but the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (i can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200b;

so the day comes, i have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. by the time i arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. i prepare myself with the girl i'm dating, and she invites her friends in. they are hooting and hollaring as i'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. the whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, i'm really into this idea now.

&#x200b;

i throw my legs over my head as i've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... i circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. i put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and i hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. i'm trying to look back to see them, but i'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. i start getting more and more into it, and the girl i'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. at this point i'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. the girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200b;

after a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""cum in your mouth! cum in your mouth!""... now to be clear, i normally don't do this. i have before, lol, but it's not my thing. but i'm the entertainment, and i aim to please, so in my mind i'm thinking lets do this. i start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. the girl i'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. the whole thing is so hot and i feel like i'm about to cum, and.....explode. it was a lot. i'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. the girl i'm dating let's go of my legs and i fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - i'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. so i stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and i look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. my assistant.

&#x200b;

she leaves the room, i race to the bathroom. the girl i'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and i tell her. she loses it laughing - ""so and so is your assistant?! ahahahah"". i'm not laughing. assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200b;

it's actually a bit of a scene, the girl i'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling assistant and she is not answering. the girl i'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200b;

i've been working from home all week. i've talked to my assistant via slack and we've said nothing. she is in the office. i can't work from home tomorrow. i don't know what the fuck to do. the girl i'm dating said that assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. i really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. we haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200b;

edit:  the diagram(https://imgur.com/a/rr31ebi)!  i'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  i'm not a turkey, i promise.

edit 2: to clarify, i don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  i think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  the diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until i stood up.  at least this is the logic i am convincing myself of.

edit 3:  i'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl i am dating"" because honestly i wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  i don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

edit 4:  yes, they were staring at my butthole.  i'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. to be honest if,

edit 5:

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts.  no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement.  a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  better than jerking off that's for sure.

and yes, i have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

thanks for coming to my ted talk.",4
"by trying to play my dad's didgeridoo.. so my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in australia 10+ years ago. my parents wanted to go out for a walk but i decided i'd eaten too much cheese and couldn't be arsed. while they were out the internet went down so i was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when i spotted the didg. i thought to myself in all these years i've never actually tried to play it (it's more of a decoration and i barely take it in when i see it) and maybe it's time. i pick it up and put it to my lips. i felt like i knew what i was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. i take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. i splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. at first i thought it was saliva and ignored it as i had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. it felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. i glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. the second i clock what's happened i feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. i have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. i run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. i urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. i don't think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

tl;dr - thought i could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.

edit; woah gold! and front page! ta! glad you all like/hate my story",4
"by not making the bed and causing my wife's entire family to panic. throwaway because i'm still embarrassed and i don't want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.

for background, i usually make the bed in the mornings, but i didn't yesterday morning because i was running late.

i went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. i got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. i checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and i just couldn't find her. her wallet was there so i figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. i started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. i called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. i called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. my father in law told me to track her phone, so i went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. i turn on the find my iphone sound and start running through the apartment thinking i should call the cops.

i hear the sound coming from our bedroom so i go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell i'm doing. turns out the small lump that i thought was just a pile of blankets since i didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. she sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

i had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

tl;dr i didn't make the bed yesterday morning and then i thought i was about to end up in an episode of svu.",4
"by going down a reddit rabbit hole.. this didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and i bought a new car. i was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

i came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse reddit while i'm taking care of my business. most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. i can't remember what sub i was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. before i knew it i was reading about ""the donkey show."" yes that one. some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. i wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so i just kept reading.

someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how the donkey show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. midget porn. i thought, ""what the hell, i've never seen this sort of thing before."" so i clicked.

as weird as it sounds, i clicked out of curiosity......i swear. what i saw was exactly what i expected to see. this specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. after a minute or so, i had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub i was in.

i finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. i get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

she was taking a while, so i grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. my wife comes out and gets in the car. immediately she says, ""what the hell is this?"" i put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. on the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". i had never had a car with this feature before, so i was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. i knew i was screwed. it felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so i could change what was displayed on the screen.

after about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks i have a thing for little people. before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. all i could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. i'm pretty sure i'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. yay me...

she said to me one day, ""i know you won't leave me for another woman, but i'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

i doubt she will ever let this one go...

tl;dr i went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.

edit: damn! i fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, you guys are awesome! i'm glad you got a kick out of my mishap.

edit2: just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while i was pleading my case, we kept it very g rated.

edit3: removed the race of the man in the description so people stop getting triggered.",4
"by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway.. yesterday i got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. i squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. i notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where i'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. he looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. as a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

though i couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so i decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. as i sat down i thanked him for making room and told him i really appreciated the gesture. we high-fived and in hindsight i should have ended it there.

i noticed he had his backpack with him so i asked how school was that day. he told me it was just alright. then i asked the fatal question, ""do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" he let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. she yelled ""oooo boy!! you told me you finished that yesterday! guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! you, ya little liar!!!"" his head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

a few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. he looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, i thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" his look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 

hang in there little buddy! one weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies! 

&#x200b;

tl;dr- sat down next to a little dude on the subway because he went out of his way to make room for me. asked him about homework and now he cant play his video games for the whole weekend.",4
"by getting google to ban our entire company while on the toilet. **tldr; company uses google accounts that are all connected. i fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the google account, and all associated accounts. everyone in my company is now blocked by google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

preface, this happened on friday and is still on-going. i've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so i won't be outed since i guarantee someone will read this eventually. i still do not know if i am the culprit, but i am 90% sure that i am. i feel like this is a fireable offence and i will step up and take it if it comes to that. i'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

i work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. we migrated to gmail and other google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. it's safe to say that everyone is using gmail or google in one way or another. now, our gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

i have a friend who creates android apps on the side. i do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called titanium backup. 

as a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), i buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. after that, i send him an e-mail with the cloned version through gmail with something along the lines of: ""look at this cool app i found on the store, it was completely free! try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. it was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

recently he uploaded a new app and i did the same thing as usual. i was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. i was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. i e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

about an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their google accounts. at the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

one of my colleagues requested help and i went to check it out. it turns out that their account was blocked by google due to tos violations. their google payments account was blocked as well. i thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. we got banned by google, all of us. 

the afternoon was pandemonium. we were all freaking out, our it guys were trying to get a hold of google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. we could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. all our work was shared with google services.

eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. it wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. one of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

anyways, we were all told to go home on friday. i went home and looked this up myself, and i found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the google payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. it bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how i said all our work accounts were connected?

yeah...

so it's been two days now and we've been chatting over skype, no one knows what happened and the it guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that google isn't helping us out. their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. the posts i've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

so yeah, that's that. i'm 99% sure that i am the culprit who caused this. i do not know why google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but i fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. i might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**edit1:** this blew up pretty quickly. luckily, i have 3 pms from people close to, or reps who can help me out. if i missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. i am in touch with one of them now and i am getting in touch with it at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. i will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out.

"by seeing my mother's porn.. my pc sits next to my stepdad's laptop in the living room. my cat likes to jump on the keyboard or the laptop and lay on it. a moment ago, he jumped up onto the keys and the screen lit up showing me to opened photo gallery. i went over and was going to close the application and then shut down the laptop. i was greeted with three distinct photos.

&#x200b;

one- my mother and my stepdad in a threesome. the thing is, the person in the middle was my mother's best friend. i saw her eating out my own mother as my stepdad drilled the other girl.

&#x200b;

two- my mother sucking off my stepdad, in my dad's house. on the counter. where i eat.

&#x200b;

three- more tame, but my stepdad (who is bald) with a decent head of hair. i've never seen him with more than a little fuzz before.

&#x200b;

so i have to face them tomorrow with these images seared into my mind.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - saw my mom's porn. help me god.

edit: my mother woke me up while i was operating on three hours of sleep and ho boy. my stepdad uses reddit. he found this. you fuckers brought me to the front page. this is my first time ever here and my lord, why this post? thanks anyway, even though my life just got a lot worse, now i have 10k virtual clicks!

"by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter. this just happened last week. i got home from working out of town thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. ""beth"" comes in and i can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. she feels fine though. 

i am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. i wake beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. it is more than half closed and a little red. she still feels fine. as soon as the doctor opens, i call them and they tell us to come in.  

we get there and i go to check in. the receptionist that i have never seen looks at my daughter and says ""oh. my goodness, what happened?""  so i respond as a joke ""eh, she got out of line"".   

i know!  it's horrible. i'm sorry!  i have a weird sense of humor and i'm a bit socially awkward.  anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  soon we are called in. the checkup goes as expected. it's a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter zyrtec or benadryl.  then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

he comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. the doctor is angry. we all head to the doctor's office to talk.  

there is a policeman and a policewoman. the policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. my daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  so she says no and buries her face in my side.  the police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. i saw one of beth's cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. the doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

the police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. the doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. he just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  i now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  she makes an excuse and leaves the room. he says that he thinks he has to let her go. he says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. he says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

the police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if i can come to the station.  a friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

we get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   the police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. they say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  i call my wife who goes ballistic.  

the county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if i sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. my uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. i stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that i really don't need to make for this week.  i can't wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but i'm pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.  

edit: spelling

edit 2:  update
thank you for the gold kind strangers.
wow this blew up.  i wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  i want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  for those of you saying that i am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) i will not be sleeping on the couch.  my wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  at least not at me.

2) i am heading home from boston tomorrow evening and i think everything should be resolved by then.

3) i will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  she was very young did not do this out of animosity. i do not know what if anything will happen to her job. i am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) the other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  a few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  these lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  the receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   the dep closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  it turned out to be nothing.",4
"by teaching my baby sign language. i go to this ""mommy and me"" thing every week with my daughter. not because it's my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as ""a christmas gift"" to my one-year-old (aka she doesn't think i am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. but all these kids know sign language, and i thought that was pretty damn cool. so i start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! she can call me mom and my husband, dad! holy shit! thanks pinterest moms! i take back all the shit i talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

well today with my husband out of town, i didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants i decided to go out for a quick dinner. the kid loves french fries and so do i. so we hit the local burger joint and i order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. the server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and i set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. so of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". and every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. ok, whatever. 

well i notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. i'm like okay, i did like 4 quick google searches, maybe i botched some of what i taught her. it's fine. but then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iphone down with a message typed out for me to read. it says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

i'm like... wait... what? so she continues to show me that i have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since i am her mom. i can only imagine what the pinterest moms would've done had i shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

tl;dr asl is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

eta: thanks, everyone! i'm glad you all enjoyed this post. please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that i was trying to teach my child proper asl. they were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as asl. they just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

also please note that i literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. i have no idea how close they were to the real signs. additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. she speaks english well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. we were always sure to say the words while signing them. she now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that i decided to share with you all. i'm new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen ""today"". you can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)",4
"by letting my boyfriend have control over the lube.. we are in the middle of the polar vortex. i got a phone call last night saying that i didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.

we decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. i was ready to get laid, because, well, i wanted to. so i told my boyfriend to grab the lube while i climbed on top of him.

the bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it like this(https://i.imgur.com/llijq5v.jpg). i was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. he squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

while he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. he couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as i screamed and jumped off him.  the bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

i now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. we sobered up real quick, i fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

&#x200b;

tl;dr boyfriend got too close using the lube, clit got vacuumed into the 7th gate of hell.",4
"because i finally learned how to wipe my butt. i asked my girlfriend the other day, ""why do the doors of the bathroom stalls have space on the bottom?""

she told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

i followed up by saying, ""but sometimes, people can see my butt.""

she started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

so i had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; i wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

i then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/(http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and i was shocked.

we were both curious where/how i even learned that from.

was it a potty training error? apparently not. we asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

so, i've been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.

\#dead

tl;dr

for 20 years, i squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt.",4
"as a reaction to butt worms (almost certainly nsfw). this is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.

also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

for background: at some point in my childhood, i developed pin-worms. in the interest of science, i must admit that i don't know for certain that i had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that i had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

i'm afraid that i don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all i remember is that as a young child i walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and i don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

fast forward a decade and a half: i am living on my own. single. re-acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone i am still close to refers to as ""she-who-must-not-be-named"". i don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....i had worms. my butt was beyond-normally itchy. sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. the confirmation came when i showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

i hoped they would go away. i showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. but every morning, i would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

i was horrified, but i made an appointment at my local clinic. when i told the nurse over the phone that i thought i had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. she said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

i went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly south-east indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

i was already frustrated, but i waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. later i drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before i would get results.

in the meantime, i remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.

i would like to say that as a liberal american male, i wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that i did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, i dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what i had done.

now to add: i had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. we had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; i wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and i found ourselves showering. my hand drifted down to my butt-crack and i realized i \*needed\* to share my story with her, despite fears that i would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. so i spurted it out: ""uhm, so yeah, i...uh...think i have butt worms....""

she was so practical about it. she asked to see. i pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""see,"" i said, embarrassed. ""worms.""

...

""that's toilet paper"", she replied.

""w...what?""

""yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""that's toilet paper.""

everything fell into place. about a month ago, when finances got tight, i swapped my normal tp roll with dollar store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after i wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

my relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . my shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

tldr: i spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because i bought cheap toilet paper.

postscript: shower companion and i just celebrated our 8th year wedding anniversary.",4
"tifu- by not knowing about sunblock expiration dates. i applied spf 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. i was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

i pretty much had no idea that i had a problem until i scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. i considered for a split second that i had a burn but like an idiot, i rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

the blisters formed by the next day and i started reading the can to see if i missed something about applying it. i found the customer service number and called it. before talking to anyone, i heard a recording tell me that the fda doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. this bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

i had no clue. 

i went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

it was easily one of the most painful things i have ever experienced. except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. i soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


this was preventable- sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions. 

nsfl
 https://imgur.com/3nge8nm.jpg 


edit- i want to clear up: i'm naturally, very pale person, i was at high altitude while on and in the water. i do not blame anyone but myself for this. whether expired or i stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. i should have been careful with making sure the things i use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
i agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, i just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
this isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

i'm not planning to sue anyone although i appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
i just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! be safe! skin cancer is a real danger.

tl;dr- sunblock expires.",4
"by watching my neighbours fight while i was eating popcorn.. so i'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally i was watching the match on my living room little did i know there was another match going on my neighbours house. about ten minutes into my game, i started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.

between the game and the distance between us i really couldn't distinguish any words, so i just raised the volume of my tv and kept watching. during half time i got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so i lower the volume of the tv as i microwave some popcorn.

by this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as i take the popcorns out of the microwave i hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so i went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case i had to call the cops of something. now i have two dogs so i didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so i brought it with me.

so here i am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. for the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. by now i could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so i thought. suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as i gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.

now try to see this from their perspective. they've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. this got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.

""enjoying the show you \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!?""

i honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. they both flip the finger at me as walked inside ""can you believe this fucking guy!?"" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.

when i got inside i was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.

edit: i know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments i've gotten.  you all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! also shut out to all the cruz azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game i was watching!

edit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a and it probably isn't a dramatic one i'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.

tl;dr my neighbours were having a big fight while i was watching a soccer game, i went out to check while she slapped her husband as i was holding a big bag of popcorn. my nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again.",4
"update: yesterday, i posted about how i almost killed a girl with asthma by dabbing. thanks to reddit, i asked her out. we're dating!. hey! y'all remember me? yesterday, i made this post (https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a2pdlw/tifu_by_making_a_girl_i_like_laugh_so_hard_she/) about when i almost killed a girl by making them laugh so hard it caused an asthma flare-up. well, thanks to the incredible support of the reddit community (i got hundreds of pms urging me to go for it yall be crazy lol) i asked her out. and guess what....

after promising it most likely would not result in another hospital trip, she said yes! we're going out this friday for a dinner. i know some people warned me about dating people at work, but honestly after what i happened i think i'm kinda obligated by the universe to go for it. 

thanks for giving me the support to do it guys. i was gonna flake-out.
so remember ladies and gents, if you ever have a crush on them, fucking dab on them. if it works with the haters, it'll work with the lovers.

tl;dr. gave a girl an asthma attack by dabbing on them. they laughed too hard and ended up in the hospital. reddit made me work up up the courage to ask them out. somehow it worked. what the hell.

"by telling both my wife and mom about an item on ebay i wanted for my birthday...they unknowingly got into a bidding war against each other and drove the price up considerably.. so my birthday is coming up and i found an item on ebay that i thought would be cool as a present. i figured i would casually mention it to both my wife and my mom...not thinking that either of them would actually try to bid on it.

well lo and behold, they both ended up bidding on it to try to win it for a birthday present for me and they unknowingly got into a bidding war with each other!!! they ended up driving up the price by about $200 before my wife finally won the auction. they could have just bought it new in the store for $50 less then she won it for!

tl;dr: i mentioned to both my wife and mom about an item on ebay i thought would be nice for my birthday...they unknowingly got into a bidding war against each other and drove the price up considerably.

"by not going to the hospital when i knew something was wrong with me. as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...

sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.

i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i'm not a big fan of, and napping.

i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.

i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn't let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up!"" (dave chappelle voice)

the dr. came flying into the room and said, ""hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap!""

my life stopped. ""a stroke? i'm 29? how could i have had a stroke?"" i couldn't comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides) i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, ""couldn't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" she told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (wednesday). if you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i've had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!

the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

but wait...there's more!!!

6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which i did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv's had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn't see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

fast forward, to october 2, 2017.

my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in april) for help but i don't remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

i did a follow up with my pcp (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...

i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.

what this means for me now is i'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i'm a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i'm not happy about it, but i don't let it change my outlook on life.

i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i'm out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.

i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i'm begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don't be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health

yesterday, i stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt instant pot at target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. i decided i would get some christmas shopping done early and flip a few. i ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. i go to target and give them my id, they look it up and can't find it at first. i give them the order number and i hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. the one says he has to let the manager know i'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but i didn't think much of it.

fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. the doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. i step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the state police counter terrorism unit and they start questioning me about why i'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if i know what they can be used for, if i'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the target parking lot. i did my best to explain the price mistake and how i found it, etc. i think they accepted my explanation but i'm still nervous that i'm on a watchlist now.

tl:dr tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 instant pots at target, got interrogated by state police counter terrorism unit why i was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

edit: here's the investigator's card since so many people seem to be doubting my story. i covered up personal info so i don't dox him or myself.

"by missing every sign on a date. so didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. i invited a close friend to the movies with me. a few odd things happened, and it wasn't until i spoke to a friend of mine that i realized i missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) beforehand, i jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and i got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). she replies ""don't worry, if that were you and i, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. i laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. i replied, ""i guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. she then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in my car though"". i then replied ""you know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) when we get back to her house, she asks if i want to go inside to get a soda, to which i politely declined because i wasn't thirsty.

tldr: i missed strong signs that she was dtf


edit: there is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again.

"by attempting suicide without realizing it. so, as i was making myself breakfast this morning, i for some reason started wondering what would happen if i touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. being the very intelligent man i am, i of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. i instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. a small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

the worst part is, i still didn't realize what i had actually just done. i just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. as i grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that i had almost electrocuted myself. maybe i was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. if i had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, i would have gotten an electric shock.

i haven't told anyone yet, and i don't think i will.

tl;dr: curiosity almost killed the cat.",4
"by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.. obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

i had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. i proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! or so i thought. 

about 3 weeks after our proposal, i notice she starts acting different. not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. she had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of m-f each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. i went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when i have work the next day, so i often opted out.

we would also share our google location with each other at all times. mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and i would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. i looked at her location one day and it was turned off. i texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. hadn't been a problem for the past year. she turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. she also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. i only had the location for the personal phone. eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

two days ago, about a month after the proposal, i decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and i just wanted to put it to rest. i used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. she had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. i called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. she said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

i waited until she got home and confronted her about it. she said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought i would get mad. turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. i kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time i asked.

the next day when i got home from work, i asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. she said she deleted them. so i said i wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. i started recovering the data from the last backup. she sat down beside me while i was doing it, and asked what i was doing. i told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! so she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. i asked her one last time, ""before i look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" she was silent. i asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. so that's a win i guess.

planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. havn't told her yet. still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. feels shitty but i'm keeping my head up.

tldr; by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. it has been one month since the proposal now.

edit: wow! thank you all for the encouraging comments! they help so much more than i would've thought. some of these really got to me, and reading that i should've posted this as a lifeprotip made me laugh. most if all, it helped me confirm that it was not a fu on my part, but actually a gift that it happened so early. thank you all, so much! going to read through and respond to as many as i can.

"by kicking my son!. this happened a few weeks ago.

my ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, ""dad! kick me!""

so i did.

hear me out, please. the kick was a 3/10 on firmness. not gentle, but not painful. he's a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he's an only child, i feel like i need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. i also want him to ""lose some battles"", and to learn to ""roll with the punches"". 

anyway... i performed a front kick whilst making the bruce lee noise. i trust that you know the one. 

my son recoiled. he looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. he didn't cry,, but it was close.

he blurted out ""i said kiss me!!!""

oops!



tldr; i misheard my son, which resulted in me kicking him.",4
"by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended. obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. my brother and i have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). this agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so i was convinced he still remembered.

a couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. i got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. i decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. there's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. so i went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""brother's name, if you're watching this, i'm already dead. everyone on the world pretty much is. it's been about eight months since you went to hospital name. you need to head for the safe haven in helsinki (we live in western canada) - mom might be there. god speed."" i managed to sync it up to the tv and woke him up as it was starting.

this is where it all goes to complete shit. my brother began to lose it immediately. he started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. i grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. nurses came in and i was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

he got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. my mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. my dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. i'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. i've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

worth the wait though.

tl;dr: convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

edit: wow this blew up?! i don't have a ton of time but:

1) i don't want to upload the video. i made it sound tamer than it was, i look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xd

2) the tvs in the hospital had hdmi ports. i just plugged it into my chromebook. 

3) i can see why people say i made this up for karma, but i didn't create a throwaway to do that.  if i cared that much, i would've posted it on my main account.

4) my mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. she hasn't been happy with me moving (western canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. she paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",4

"by creating a special handshake with my daughter (nsfw?). this is an ongoing tifu, i am actively looking for ways to end it.

my daughter is 3. she is the light of my life and all that. because she isn't much for drinking or golf, i have had to find activities we both enjoy to pass the day. this means we spend a great deal of time watching movies. my favorite is e.t. and i figured she'd love it too. wrong. e.t. is terrifying to a little girl. in an effort to make e.t. fun, i taught her the fingertip touch ""ouch"" thing and then we watched that scene a few times in a row. it went well and now e.t. no longer scares her. win.

she has held onto the fingertip touch and it has taken on a life its own, a bit like a not-at-all-secret handshake for us. we always do it before she goes to sleep.

her: *puts out finger* finger!

me: *touches finger* ouch!

super cute right? well... she has now taken to doing it anywhere, at any time. it became pretty annoying and when i tried to curb the frequency of it, i was met with disaster. last weekend we were at the mall when she announced loudly in a quiet jewelry store that she was going to give me the finger. a little embarrassing but not too bad. i told her that she can't say it like that because ""the finger"" sometimes means something bad. she nods, understanding and the moment passes. a few days later, at dinner with my in-laws, the handshake returns to the forefront of her mind. mid-meal, she says, ""finger! oh no wait, that's bad..."" she then thinks for a moment and screams, ""daddy, finger me!"" if i could have turned into a flock of birds and flown away forever, i would have. my in-laws turn bright red and stare at her. i immediately say, ""no no, that's not what its called"". my daughter doubles down, ""yes! finger me! ouch! remember? ouch!"" i nearly passed out.

we are now trying to rebrand the handshake as ""et"" and ""ouch"" because jesus christ i can't take her anywhere.

"by having the best dream at the wrong time. i had the most vivid sex dream the other day. the kinda dream no one would want to wake up from. i was one of the founding members of the x-men, and i was balls deep in mutant pussy. so, fucking was literally my superpower. i could cure the sick with my cum. humans and mutants alike flocked to my cock. including the members of the x-men. so, in this dream, i was fucking blink and jubilee. sparks were flying in the bedroom. i mean, damn. i never really gave a fuck about these characters in real life. but deep down in dreamland, i gave *all* the fucks. i experienced the most explosive orgasm. i woke up at that moment.

oof. i was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. i'm not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. especially if you're wearing loose pants. i locked eyes with the passenger next to me. she wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. it had the words ""best mom ever"" on the pillow case. *of course it had*. at that point i realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. i was too embarrassed to really speak, but i managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. she shook her head as if to say ""don't mention it"". and then she said this fucking shit: 

""don't worry, you've said enough in your sleep""

"by telling my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me. this happened approximately six years ago, i was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that i post it here. 

&#x200b;

so, flashback to undergrad, things are good and i just started dating this beautiful girl that i had met in class. i was enamored with her, shocked that i loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. the first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&#x200b;

after a few months into our relationship, i started to notice some concerning symptoms. as you can probably hypothesize, when i pee'd, it burned. at first, i just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, i decided to stop taking creatine just in case. but, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. i would literally be struggling to stand while i pee'd because the pain was so intense. after, i would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. it was bad. 

&#x200b;

well, at this point, i was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. no, it had to be what i thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. i hadn't been with anyone else. i hadn't been with anyone else since i began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. i was shocked. things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had i gone wrong? the thought made my blood boil, until i outright confronted her. i told her i knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. she told me no. i demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. she said sure. (looking back at this i feel like a complete dick). we agreed that we would go the next day.

&#x200b;

the same night i confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. she was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. around this time my roommates and i had just moved into a new house. in the process all our belongings got shuffled around. as she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" i heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, i've been pissing out bleach?!?! i instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. she took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr - months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when i pee'd. i told my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an std test. the night before we went, i inadvertently discovered that i had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap.

"giving my 17 yr old nephew advice on how to meet women.. a few weeks ago i flew out to fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since i havent seen them in 4 years. the first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. they gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. the conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. the older son ,""alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at hs and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. on the other hand is my nephew ""dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. when i pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and dan. being the cool uncle i let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. as she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my marine corps days. if he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. but dont go empty handed. i suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. now that i think of it i was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. so the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 a few days later it occured to all of us dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. when his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. i however was not buying it. i pulled him aside and got the truth. the boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. he would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. he met a girl and they had been seeing each other. i was happy i could help and could not believe it actually worked. however things went south. 
 a few days after my return to the east coast i received a very emotional call from my sister. she explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""have you seen this man"" flier on the door. it was a grainy surveillance photo of dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. the flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. when she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. now dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and i told i am not invited for christmas. poor dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

"by putting a thong that was not my wife's in her underwear drawer. this happened 2 days ago. so last week i found a thong on the floor in my living room. smelt it like the animal i am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.

2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.

huh... i found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? it was clean so i put it in your drawer. what it's not yours?

angrily, she answers it's not hers. you just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?

i tell her what the hell am i suppose to say. she goes back upstairs really angry at me.

so last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. i send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. it is. we're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... we came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

now the real fuck up. my wife is in the bed. i go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. just texted her and the thong is hers. the only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

you want me to believe that?! that makes no sense

jesus christ, i don't even believe my explanation myself. i tell her to believe what she wants, i don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that i don't have anything to redeem myself. i take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

the next morning she calls me. she tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that i'd put it in her drawer. and if i was cheating on her, i'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

tldr : found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. almost lost my wife to it.

edit : omg it exploded. thanks for the silver mystery redditors! i know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! had fun with the others that told similar stories :) and yes, i told my friend that i sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.

"by eating the ends off a chicken wing.. yesterday i ate the ends of a chicken wing. someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so i tried it out. i never expected this to happen. 

i must not have chewed one properly. i got something lodged in my throat. to dislodge it i ate some bread and drank some softdrink. some pain persisted but i went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. 

this morning i woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. i walked to the public hospital down the road because i was starting to worry. 

the gp noticed i had a ""crunchy throat"" when pressing on it. he immediately sent me off to get an xray. that showed i have a perforated esophagus. that is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. the ""crunchy"" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. 

to get more information i started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3219576/

they consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. it's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. a few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. they said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. 

now i'm waiting on the results of the ct scan which will determine whether i get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. if i'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. 

tl;dr: i ate the ends off a chicken wing and now i'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.

**update:** a surgeon just spoke to me. i have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. they don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.

**update 2:** the main surgeon just spoke to me. i'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. the critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. so i can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and i need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.

**update 3:** i had a tube pushed into my arm, through a vein, all the way to the top of my heart. it's called a picc. it's how i'll be eating and drinking over the next week.",4

"by accidentally pulling out my gf's tampon while watching tv. yesterday evening my gf and i thought it would be nice to watch lord of the rings after coming home quite late. after aproximately 4 hours i was really tired and couldnt think straight anymore. she had her ""strawberry week"" so she was plugged, which i frankly didnt care too much about. we just came along the credits in the movie and i was casually stroking her ass when i realised there is a thread hanging somewhere.

i thought its just a random thread from the blanket, you know the ones hanging from some clothes.

i think it was muscle reflexes or something like this, my tired brain didnt think at all and i just pulled hard without realising of what i just did.

my girlfriend said: "" wtf are you do-"" and it was already out creating a mess everywhere until i realised what actually happened.

after explaining that i thought its from the blanket, my gf couldnt stop laughing and i felt quite ashamed. made up the bed right after and went to sleep right next to my still giggling gf.

**tl;dr:** accidentally ""unplugged"" my girlfriend while watching a movie creating a mess in my bed

"by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral. this happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time, and i was having a pretty bad day, i was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. if youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so i do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....then i here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so i wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so i pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, i take down his number so i can repay him later on. at this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months. my auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon.
my son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

tl;dr got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and i somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

"by announcing to my daughter that i only shave my vag when her dad is due home. this literally just happened about an hour ago and had me and my husband alternating between cringing in embarrassed, and giggling like a couple of immature schoolchildren.

for context, my husband works away at sea for weeks at a time; he is due to leave later today, so is busy getting organised and packed up ready to go. 

he realised that he had ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that i am, i offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland.
he commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and i assured him that that wouldn't be the case as i use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come. 

tl;dr basically the title, and the fact that my 13-year-old daughter has learnt a bit more about her mother than probably either of us are comfortable with her knowing.

"by masturbating in front of my entire family. this happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which i was extremely anxious about. all together, i was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager i am, i often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

so, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, i lay down in my living room with my family, watching tv. i dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since i had done next to no study at the time). 

not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, i decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

and so off i went. except i forgot one thing.

i was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that i was not in fact sitting with my family by our tv, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

i don't really understand how or why it happened. a few seconds in and i began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

i snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment i put myself in. 

i'm not going to talk about what happened next, as i don't want to relive the next few moments.

my father is just disappointed. he hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

my mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as i write this. 

and i'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. i find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe i was just dreaming while i was gassed up. 

but it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

tl:dr returned from dentist gassed up, beat my meat while in front of my whole family, i now live in shame.",4
"by buying my mom an amazon device.. i want to start by giving some background here. i basically live, eat, sleep and breath amazon. i need something, straight to amazon. i use kindle and audible daily. want to stream music, amazon music. want a new movie, prime video. run out of something randomly, ""hey alexa......."" laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. so when looking for a place to store photos, i see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with amazon photos"". naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. automatically upload photos from my phone? even better. 

rewind to september 25th, my mom's birthday. i thought about her gift for a while, but when i remembered she didn't have a smart tv, the answer was easy. i hop on amazon shopping and use my amazon credit card to purchase one firetv stick. she was so happy she could watch netflix on her tv now. yay, success! or so i thought. 

yesterday i get an email from amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the fire tv family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did i imagine that it would sign in to my amazon account without even asking for a password. surely she'd have to use her own account. 

fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. sitting in my mother's kitchen, i glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

i spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. i happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. i'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. i took probably 40 pictures that night for my so to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my entire family to view. i have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

nobody helped me. the remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where i'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. i didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, i just ran away. 

the worst part, i asked alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, i'm not sure about that."" fuck amazon.

update: i promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. i talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. however, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

i'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an amazon ad, i just wrote it how i wrote it because i thought it was funny. i wish amazon was paying me for this crap. 

i'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. yes i fucked up, i was a dumbass, that's why i posted it here. yes, i should have known this could happen. call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my so do. it's fun. i don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. it happened. 

thanks to everyone for the awards and sharing your similar stories, they made me laugh. and thanks for checking out my cat!!!!!

"by joking about ancestrydna and 23andme.. this actually happened over christmas last year.

my family, including (paternal) my grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having christmas dinner. 

my grandfather brought up that he did ancestrydna (or was it 23and me?). i don't remember the exact one, because i can barely think about it. it's hard just writing this up.

it was really cool to hear what he found. he found mostly scandinavian spread out over the british isles, particularly wales. we knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% persian! very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. he's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. 

the only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of king george iii. the reason why i question this is king george iii is recorded as one of the few kings who never had a mistress. 

however, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of king george iii (we are descended from the woman). he mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

anyway, off topic. i thought it was fascinating, and i love hearing what he's found. i brought up possibly using my christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. i don't think i was really going to do it, i usually use the money to pay bills.

silence. and it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

my sister and i look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. my parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. we look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. i have weird hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. my sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

i always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. i never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair i have such cool pretty eyes. 

well, okay.

dad starts first. dad (d), mom (m), sister (s), and me.

d: there's a chance 3ar3ara_g0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

s and me: imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. my sister grabs my hand (i love her big sister ways).

me: okay, um... 

d: your mom never had an affair. this isn't some cheating story.

me: wha.. (i start to feel very sick).

m: i hoped to never have to tell you this. i was raped. the reason we're not sure is because your dad and i had sex earlier that day.

me: (i want to die, i start crying). everyone else knows though, if they left the table.

d: your grandparents know.

s: okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

m: no, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

me: he's still out there?

s: but obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

my dad and mom look at each other. 

m: it was my brother.

i felt so sick. i felt... dirty. i had to run to the bathroom to throw up. i couldn't stop shaking. my sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. we probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

the rest of the vacation was just weird. if it weren't for my nephews, i'm pretty sure i would have just gone home.

oh my nephews are wonderful.

well, we came home, and i had to battle with the ""do i want to know?"" thoughts. i could get a dna test. but i couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. but it weighed on me too much. i had to know in order to move forward. so i asked my dad if he would submit his dna with mine. we weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. it was hard asking him to not say anything to her. he should be able to talk to his wife.

so we submitted the test. 

i am my father's daughter. i cried when i got the results. it was a huge weight off my shoulders.

i made a decision not to tell my dad - i wanted to surprise them. i kept saying i hadn't gotten the results back. i did tell my sister though.

i gave them the piece of paper on mother's day. i was going to wait until father's day, but i couldn't. so i got a blank card. 

inside i wrote: ""mom, open the paper."" she opened it and i had written happy mother's day, and happy early father's day. 

lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

thank god.

edit: left out half a sentence, oops. 

it was my uncle on my mother's side. i have met him. my sister and i were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

my parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there i guess was his reason. plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

my mom didn't go no contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. why that long, i have no idea. those are her reasons. 

she did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. i guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

grandmother is dead now.

this happened in louisiana. 

edit 2: mods, if this isn't considered appropriate for this sub, please feel free to take it down. i thought i fucked up by the secret coming out in the first place. but it is a happy ending. i leave it up to you glorious mods.

**tl;dr:** i found out i could have been the product of a rape - by my uncle. anxiety and tears ensued. found out i am my father's daughter. surprised them. happy ending!",4
"by my wife and i referring to ""no"" as the ""n word"" with our 12 month old son and having child protective services called on us. so my wife and i have a four year old and a one year old.  when our one year old is up to mischief and we tell him ""no"" he immediately looks up at us and starts crying.  it's actually pretty adorable.

in order not to upset him we frequently refer to it as the ""n word"" when he's around.  

queue two weeks ago when our four year old is in daycare and telling all his friends and the teacher that ""mommy and daddy use the n word all the time and it upsets his brother and makes him cry"".  teacher berated my wife and told her we were horrible people and didn't really get it when my wife explained that it was a big mix up.

we also got child protective services called on us anonymously.  think it's the teacher but it may have been a parent.

tldr: everyone at our kids school thinks we are constantly throwing ""the bad n word"" around our sons and are horrible people and parents.

"by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother. now this didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and i am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

so, a few weeks ago i was at my gf's house, usually the plan when i go is i sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch tv, play games and other stuff. everything was normal, i chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general tv.

this is where the fuck up happens.

after around an hour or so, me and my gf were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

i'm enjoying this more than i ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since i started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

she starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. literally within less than 30 seconds, i'm already ready to release my load, i try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but i just can't, it feels too good. 

right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst i'm there in my birthday suit. my girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock i release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

i sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. my girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then i hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

although me and my gf are still together, i haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

tl;dr - gf was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and i ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit.",4
"by being funnier than my so and allowing her to post it on reddit.. this happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. 

last night while my so was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. she is a bartender and didn't want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. so i jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

while i'm making my journey, i decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. i'm in a pretty great mood. i had the day off and my so was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some new girl. 

my journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. just open desert. so while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. ""what can i do to add a little romance to this situation? cover the bed in some dove chocolates? maybe some flowers?"" 

i make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. miraculously, i made it back home before her.

finally i decide, ""nah, romance isn't nearly as great as comedy."" so when i get home, i break open the box and spell out ""anal?"" on the bed with the tampons. 

so gets home and goes straight to the room to change. i follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

she takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. now she won't stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is ""famous"". 

i've created a monster. 

tldr; spelled out ""anal?"" with my so's tampons. she thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. reddit agreed and now she thinks she's famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.

edit: wow! my first ever medal. thank you kind stranger. now at least i can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.

edit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.

edit 3: we are ending this ""contest"" at 11:59 pst on 7/17/19. it looks like i am going to win but since she is not able to edit/update her original post, i would like to say a few things... i had no clue this would blow up like this. i thought i'd get 10 upvotes and send it to her as a joke when she was being obnoxious about having 2500 more karma than me in the span of a day while i've been in here for a year. this has made our day off together one of the best ones in a while. 

that being said, please go show her some of that love i know reddit is so capable of showing. she is truly my better half and deserves all the attention and happy comments.",4

"by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but actually close to a year ago. last october to be exact. 

so backstory. i had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. they just didn't want one thing: us having sex before marriage. they had a lot of reasons. and we were actually planning on it. but we both weren't virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. so of course, temptation got the better of us. okay, end of backstory. 

she was a senior in high school and i had just started college about an hour away. we rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. we would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. everytime she would leave i would get sad, but knew i'd see her again. 

one time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. no answer. she said she was gonna text her. made sense to me. once she said we had, we got right to business. she put her phone on the bed, and i didn't even 

things went on for awhile. lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. lots of fun. and by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. followed by some vibrating. it was her phone ringing, but we couldn't find it. then we found it under my ass. we laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. it was her mom. and within seconds, my girlfriend's expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

turns out that she hadn't clicked send on the text she sent out. so her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. and in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone ""daddy"" who was definitely not her dad (the mother's words, not mine).  

she told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
my girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. i attempted to calm her down but she wouldn't. so i drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying ""how could she do this"" and other things along those lines. my girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. her mother absolutely said i was not allowed over. 

so we got back to our hometown, i parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn't get caught. she drove home. i called my mom for a surprise ""i'm home for the weekend"". she came and picked me up, and i bawled in her arms. i told her everything. she comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

we got back to my house, and i laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. i cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. for the longest time, i thought i never would hear from her again. then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. she said she was coming over and we needed to talk. once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. she said her parents were calm now, and then i was gonna be able to come talk. i was nervous, but i loved her so i did it. 

when i got to their house, i walked in and instantly just started apologizing. i went on and on about how ""we won't do it again"" and how ""we're just stupid teenagers"" and most importantly how i was gonna ""rebuild their trust"". eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. we opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

at the end of it all, i learned they just loved their daughter and didn't want her getting hurt. but they trusted me. and we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. and everything is cool. sometimes i worry it's still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support.

"by forgetting babies exist.. so i've been spending a lot of time around dogs. i've recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. my reddit is covered in dogs from various sources. my facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. basically everywhere i turn, i see dog. not a bad life to live. until yesterday (yifu i know). i walked one of my mother's friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. it wasn't very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. it's hot. i've just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. i want to blame dehydration for this fu, but really i know i'm just an idiot. a couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. my first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. i don't know. it's a hot day and i've seen dogs in pushchairs before. maybe they didn't want its paws on hot tarmac. maybe they're just a little extra. regardless, the thought that babies exist didn't enter my tiny stupid brain. as they got up to leave and walk by me, i decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words ""what breed is it?"" and gestured towards the pushchair. they looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. it was a baby. a human baby. i'm so glad they took the traditional british approach of confused stare and silence. if they had said something i think i would have disintegrated on the spot. it was a long walk home after that and thankfully, i didn't pass anymore pushchairs. 

tl;dr i asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the internet.",4
"by flashing my breasts...not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job.. i've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""early stages"" feels like i joke because i've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

as part of the hiring process for company x, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. it's a lot. i also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but i *really* hate my job. what can you do?

anyway, i pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me i'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. to ensure i'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, i have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

now, when i'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, i'm working from home for my current job. because i wfh, i'm not always the most presentable. we're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. i look bummy. i'm a bummy girl who works from home. to be clear though, i'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

anyway. i didn't take this into consideration when i opened up my computer for these tests. i *really* didn't take it into consideration when i opened up the program to begin the tests. i only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

and then...because apparently i have no shame??? i decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). this was a super sobering moment, guys.

i really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. so, i stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. while getting up, i haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. i took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. that's when i realized i wasn't wearing a bra (why would i be. i'm wfh, remember?), and the shirt i'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. i started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. i pull one out, put it on. dig through my closet for that single shirt i was looking for. find it, put it on. bam. ready.

i flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). getting myself all situated, i went to push record to start the exam.

there was no record button.

instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. it read something like 00:09:04.

it had been recording the entire time. the whole time.

me cringing at my reflection? recorded. me smelling my sweatshirt? recorded. me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *recorded.*

i had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. for an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

i can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when i realized. i definitely whisper-spoke  ""*fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. maybe a blacked out? i don't know. what i did know in that moment, was that i was royally fucked. the recorded video submitted when you closed the window. there was nothing i could do.

and then...because i'm a dumbass, guys. i went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

so. that's it. there you have it. i might now have nudes on the internet. i might get my recruiter fired for nsfw videos. or, who knows? i might get the job.

tl;dr by not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. i may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire hr department.

edit: i'm not going to show you my titties. quit it.",4

"tifu by telling my gf to go right.. i finally get to post a fuck up. happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

my gf and i were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. awful game by the way. anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. the gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

the star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

as she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

which she immediately did.

i have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and i've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. nor have i ever been so afraid. she ended the game with 0 stars...

""i will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

the rest of the game was spent in dread. its now 3am and i'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

goodbye.

tl;dr mario party 7 is a terrible game.",4
"by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today.... when i was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. so spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and i thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  i had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
the googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until i had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out i pushed it even further in. i was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. i could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, i stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. after a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

skip forward to this tuesday;
i do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and i was submerged under water, after i emerged and pulled my boat out i could hear a slight rattle in my ear and i knew instantly what it was.
it's now friday and the rattling happens every time i turn my head and i still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

tldr: put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... it didn't

uptate:
so this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don't believe it, which is fair enough cause i think it's abit mental aswell.

however i'll get a doctor's visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and i'll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.

alot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and i can honestly say i don't have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think they're as big of thing in the uk.

thanks for hearing me out",4
"by buying a used playstation 2 on letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.. this happened only minutes ago.


the graphics card in my old ps2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so i decided to replace it when i had a little extra cash. i was out browsing different sites like craigslist and the like, when i stumbled upon the ps2 mentioned in the title. it looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


at the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


now, i should preface this by saying that i have a strange faith in the honesty of others. benefit of the doubt and all that noise. after all, the car i drive now is one i bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. why should this be any different?


starting to sound like a mistake yet?


if the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. that is almost certainly about to change. the model the seller advertised on letgo was one of the larger black brick models. like, the first generation ones. when i finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. when he showed me the goods, it was actually one of the slim and silver ps2's from later in the console's production run. he told me he had already sold the larger one.


my first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that i should have walked away when i saw i was being sold something that was improperly advertised. unfortunately for me (and i guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), i was not in the most logical mood. it was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. i just wanted to get this thing and go home.


back at the ole ranch, i hooked up the console, slapped in kingdom hearts ii, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. i'm off work and done with class, what else would i do with my evening, right? i was pretty happy with my life until i realized i had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. strange, but not altogether discouraging. i slapped in another game that i new for sure was working. didn't read. i repeated this several times with discs i knew would work; same story.


now i'm starting to get slightly pissed. i'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


i open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. i've now got no way to contact him. of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. all i could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. that, or i could get onto youtube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. i picked the latter option and went on my merry way. after a video about a quick mod i could make to the system, i was feeling pretty confident that i was going to get the last laugh on this one.


oh golly gee fuck was i wrong.


now at this point, i begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. i manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. it's putting up a little more of a fight than i saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? it was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. with a little elbow grease, it starts to give. i'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. a bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so i can live with that. the further i get it open, the more rust i see on some more critical pieces. i'm sweating again, but holding out hope. finally, the plastic casing comes free, and i experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


i experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


you see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. the first thing i notice is that the inside is covered in rust. the second thing i notice is that some of the rust is moving.


oh, that's not all rust.


*ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


do you know that scene in raiders of the lost ark where indiana jones is like, ""snakes. why did it have to be snakes?"" that was me. except with cockroaches. they are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. and now they're crawling on my hands. and these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. i threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


they're getting everywhere now. i'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. you would think that something caught fire with the way i was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. tiny, $25 freaks of nature. eventually i managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point i grabbed a can of raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


at least, i *hope* i finished the job. i'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point i'm a little too emotionally drained to care. i also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that i *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and i already need a stiff drink.


tl;dr: i bought a used ps2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

edit: hi, reddit! i just wanted to say many thanks for the gold and all the offers for cockroach-free playstations!  warms my heart, and i'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. happy redditing!",4
"by making myself an uncle nsfw. so this started 2 weeks ago

i went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a gf.

 naturally i start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. i get to teasing him about him not losing his v card, my mom is not liking the conversation. his gf ends up coming over, i stopped the teasing i'm not a monster. so i'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. i tell her not to worry about it i'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

i get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. my argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised ying and yang i grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. he grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. saying how a party would be good for him i even offered to go, (i'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, i told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (i know how that sounds). so i finally convinced her she agreed.

so i decide that i need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. i knew my bro was losing it that night. fast forward to the party, i drop him off so my mom thinks imma be there. i pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. well holy fuck did i get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  so now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and i'm becoming an uncle.

tl;dr convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his v card, he got his gf pregnant. 


update 1: so she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. so we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. i'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. my brother is getting tested for sti's i was all over him about that. also thanks for the gold and silver (i have no idea what that does). thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

update 2: everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. my brother does not have any sti's or std's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,i'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. there are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can dm and i can explain what i did if curious, how i got out, how my life has changed and all. 

update 3: *in maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! mother is crying brother is in shock and the gfs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. everyone pray for this child. 


update 4: they are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, i helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. i've started a savings account for him, and my gf and i are going to move into a place with him and his gf to help them out.",4
"by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging. happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

i was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. i noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

normally, i wouldn't think twice about it, but i was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

we pull up to a stop light, and i hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. apparently he didnt see me, because when i said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, i let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

as i turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. the way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

as i'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. it didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

she then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as i'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. the way she viewed it, i was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

the cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

tl;dr i stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

edit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. it was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford f-350",4
"by applying for jobs for the past month as ""titty boobowitz"". i've been a self-employed confectioner for the past two years and i recently started trying to get back into one of those fancy jobs with an office thingy again. i should also mention that for almost ten years i've used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. it's by no means a secret identity, but it's also not explicitly connected to my real name. or so i thought. i had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when i received this email from one that i was particularly excited about:

***i have to say when ""titty boobowitz"" appeared in my inbox i got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  

***i look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** 

ooops. my stomach fell right out of my ass when i read that. and of course the most recent thing i had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. i tried to do damage control, but i did not have high expectations. today i finally received the follow up ""you're not moving on to the interview process"" email.  

tl;dr: somewhere along the line while i was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to titty boobowitz in gmail and i never noticed. then i attempted job hunting. no wonder i got no responses.

edit: just because i didn't make it clear - i emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and i appreciated the heads up. we had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. i'm relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to tons of idiots like me. at least i didn't put ""attention to detail"" anywhere in my resume.

"by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.. this came to a head on sunday night. i've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. she would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. this was fine for a few weeks. then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. i dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. that this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. i wouldnt know.

my mind jumps to affair. the love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. i figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. i basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. she declined, said maybe when she gets back. like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. so i follow her. there is a dennys down the road from our house. she gets out and goes in. im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. i go inside and i cant find her. nowhere to be seen. its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. she finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""how can you do this to me!"" the fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. my wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""you're caught, where is the guy?."" ""what?"" ""dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""there isnt a guy."" ""why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" at this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. in the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""i had to use the bathroom."" uncontrolled sobbing. ""what....you had to what?"" ""i had to go to the bathroom."" ""we have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""i dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""a dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. i just never noticed, never second guessed it. she stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. so many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. her  shame was brought down by bananas. i could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. so, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

tl;dr my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

edit. thank you to whomever decided to award my idiocy and my wifes shame with gold.

edit 2. for the people asking for proof of my wife pooping.....what the hell is wrong with you. you are devin to me now.

final edit. this was posted this afternoon, at 9:31 pm, after reading the comments she asked me to play video games, announced she was going to go buy bananas and turned on every faucet we have while locking herself in the bathroom.",4
"by swallowing my little sister's birthday present. i am so beside myself with shame that i almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

but reddit karma is my mistress and i must heed her sweet call. 

so yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), i was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

now, i cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. i looked at that ring in my hand and i just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a bugs bunny cartoon. my primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

so i did it.

i think it was the next split second when i saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that i realized what a horrible mistake i had made. 

so my little sister runs screaming from my room and i hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as i admitted that i, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. no, i didn't know why i did it. yes, i am an idiot. no one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

so brief intermission from my sister's birthday as i make a quick excursion to the er, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them i was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. they took a couple x-rays and i hung around the er for about 8 hours before they broke the news that i was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

i shat out the ring this morning. 

happy birthday sis. 

tl;dr: i am an idiot and i ate my sister's ring because i thought it would be funny. 

edit: good fucking god my inbox. tune in tomorrow morning and i'll share a picture of the accursed ring

edit 2: no, not a picture of it covered in shit.

"by inhaling my tongue ring, ending up pregnant and almost dead.. this is still occurring but it started last week and that day started normal like always, i went to work and when i went to lunch it turned to the worst week of my life.  i was sent on lunch and while i was eating my tongue ring somehow came off and instead of what i initially thought was me swallowing it, the xrays at the hospital showed it was inhaled and went into my lung.   since they had to do an x-ray and a cat scan, i was asked if i was pregnant, i told them absolutely not.  since i have the paraguard iud implanted(birth control).  they did blood work and then came to speak to me and told me that i was in-fact pregnant!  i was absolutely shocked and scared, i called my husband and my mom and told them the news, my husband rushed to the hospital and when he got here he asked if i told them about the iud which i had not yet.  when he told them they said after they performed the  bronchoscopy, they would have to immediately remove the iud. the procedure was really simple and they removed the tongue ring in 30 minutes and i was fine for the most part other than a sore throat.  they came and spoke to me about the pregnancy and the problems the iud can present to it, they immediately removed the iud and told me that it was bent and slipped down which is the reason it didn't work properly after me having it for more than a year.  they also scheduled a ultrasound, when they went in for the ultrasound they couldn't find the pregnancy which raised some concerns, ultimately after two days of waiting in the icu they confirmed it was an ectopic pregnancy, they said the pregnancy was very early so they sent me home with a shot to kill the pregnancy and i was to follow up every two days at a clinic to make sure the pregnancy was being successfully terminated.  everything was alright and even though i had cramps and all other sorts of side effects as long as they weren't too sever i would be fine.  i was feeling completely better saturday morning, but after a shower i suddenly felt a sharp pain on my shoulder and then sever abdominal pain that left me incapacitated, i've never felt such severe pain, after speaking to the clinic through the phone they told me to immediately head to the er, when i arrived they performed an ultrasound which almost made me pass out from the pain and they confirmed my pregnancy burst inside my ovary and i was bleeding internally, so i'm now back home but after the worst weekend of my life i'm left out of work for at least 6 weeks and struggling to get out of bed.  they said if i had not come in i would be dead. luckily the doctors were able to save my ovary.  

tl:dr   inhaled my tongue ring, got diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, the pregnancy burst in my ovary and almost killed me.",4
"almost eating my cousin out in her office. (update at bottom!)

this happened yesterday. i can't wait until it's much further away than that.

so this is a throwaway, i have \*(had) another account where i like to post nudes of myself. that can be your judgement, and why i do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but i do. as a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies i get are from guys. but occasionally i get replies from girls who frequent these subs. my face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. just my... ya know, body.

so i had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. she said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. a lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

she is from a large city on the other side of the country as i am, but conveniently i was traveling there next week (this week). we started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. she worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. this idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. we decided i would carry an envelope and say its for office ""xxx,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. no names needed.

most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared waaay too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. we literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. and lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

so along comes yesterday, the big day. i'm so worked up. she's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. shows me that she is already masturbating. etc. oh lord, etc. i text her and tell her i'm in the building. i get to her office, my heart is racing but i'm beyond excited. i see the receptionist, tell her i need a signature from office ""xxx"" and she points me in the right direction. as i walk up, i see the name on the door. my cousins name. my first cousin, who i have known my whole entire life. my cousin, who i spend every holiday with and am very close with. it can't be, i think.

so i knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. and she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. i just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""heyyyy cousin, i was in town and thought i'd stop by!"" she is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""omg cousin!"" and gets up to hug me. i literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. she tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

i race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. she surely thinks this guy ghosted her, i really don't think she thought it was me. maybe i read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. i'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. i don't know really though. i texted her later and told her i was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. we're supposed to get a drink tonight. i'm petrified and don't know how in god's name i will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  it's hard to reply to all of the comments, so i'll say some stuff here.  she works for a very large company in a very large city.  she told me what floor to go, i honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    i do know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if i wanted.  like i said, it's a big company, and not a shock that i could pop in.

yes she is on reddit but i highly doubt she will see this post.  she told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  headed out for drinks now.  wish me luck guys.  i think i'm going to be honest.  i don't know.

edit 3:  well, first of all, id like to address everyone calling bs on this.  it seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  i agree and would call bs reading this also.   i can't really defend it or prove it (or can i?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, i could give a shit!)

• she doesn't have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

• she lives in nyc, it's big.  the buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. it didn't occur to me, i guess i was worked up.

• i come here often, it's not that i didn't call her, but sometimes when i'm here she'll dm or comment on my insta story and say ""hey come by and visit next time""

• in our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  there was no door man or anyone else i needed to get past.  i don't know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

• we didn't actually say ""hey cousin"" lol, i'm just censoring our names for the post.

• yes guys post nudes to reddit, i would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

• i'm 35, she's 26.

• i deleted my account after freaking out, but i'm sure i'll post again and i'll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

i decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn't fucking focus on anything else.  and as many of you guessed, she knew. she didn't buy the ""i just popped in"".  she figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that i knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  i assured her i didn't, it was really weird.  we slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  we complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  we talked about if we actually did anything, it's a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  and then we had another drink.  and then i licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  i stroked myself while i did it, and after i made her cum she helped me out.  we promised we would never do this again, but i think we'll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.


tl:dr - post nudes on reddit, girl replies with elaborate sexual fantasy, go to act out fantasy and realize girl is my cousin.",4
"by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner. happened about a week ago, but i've been hesitant to post this as i wasn't sure if it really fits. no one involved in this story is a minor. tl;dr at bottom.

i am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. there are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. we were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iphone. she was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""what?"" the collective asked.

""there's some dude's dick here!""

we gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). we laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. we looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. we also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. we couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

before i turned the setting off, everyone using my family icloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos i saved to my phone. this got annoying after my mom started questioning things i had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so i turned it off.

without thinking of the consequences, i asked her if she shared an icloud account with anyone. she said she shared one with her parents. she got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

i've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. the rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. we sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

the image is burned into all of our minds. i've never met her father but i'm terrified one day i will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and i'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

tl;dr: friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, i can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through icloud, and now none of us are okay.

edit: clarifying the tl;dr

edit 2, electric boogaloo: why on earth is this on the front page of reddit. also thanks for the silver

edit 3, freud enters the chat: since like half of the comments are ""why would you cry from seeing your dad's dick"":

* we are all americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us
* we are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn't really how we like to think about our parents
* it wasn't crying like oh my god what will i do, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like ""i can't believe this is what just happened""

edit 4, the (provable) finale: i'm not posting a picture of this man's penis you nasties",4
"by bodyslamming a girl who wanted to hug me.. i was in a new high school with absolutely no friends whatsoever and because i was very socially awkward i tried to avoid any direct confrontations with any individual whatsoever so i never really made any friends.

however in my fourth block there was this girl who i just seemed to have clicked with because out of all the students in the entire building she was the only one i really actually talked to. skip a couple of weeks i'm coming into my class when she decides to greet me with a friendly hug. 

in this moment i was completely frozen because i never really physically interact with anyone, especially females. so in this moment, i go full brain dead and as she's approaching me with open arms i decided i was going to try and be funny and pick her up from her waist and throw her over my shoulder (don't ask why i thought this would be funny, because i honestly have no clue what the fuck i was thinking) but the second she sees me go down and try and pick her up i could just see the complete and udder confusion in her face as she was just simply wanting a quick hug, but as i pick her up just to make things ten times worse, i shout,

""wwe supah slammmm!!"" 

and she's screaming and for some reason my heart just dropped realizing what i was doing and instead of lightly setting her down, i just fucking drop her and she slams right into a cluster of desks making this massive crashing sound in the middle of the room. i went to ask her if she was okay but she started crying her eyes out basically asking me what the fuck was wrong with me.

tl;dr i shouldn't be allowed around people.",4
"by fulfilling a cuckolds fantasy. obligatory this is a throwaway and this happened last winter yada yada yada.

&#x200b;

i had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but i still swiped out of boredom. they were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. only boob. there was no picture of her husband. i take a few shots and message them.  after like an hour of talking, i decide to just do it. we never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. she wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. at first i was like really not for it, i originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and i was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. at 2am i left the house, and this is where i regret everything.

&#x200b;

after driving for about an hour, i miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped two of my tires. i'm in a shitty ghetto town that i've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how i'm getting home now. i thought i was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. but since there was no turning back now, i decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

the husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as i see him, my gut and inner voice are screaming at me, don't do this, turn back. and i wish i had listened. for reasons unknown, i followed him into the house. it was pitch black, not a single light was on. he lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. i was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. if there was ever a time i disassociated, it was then and there. it was no longer me behind the wheel. the dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. does anybody remember the scene in blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? that was what i saw. a disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. i was horrified but at the same time, i didn't care. they both fucking stink, that was one of the worst things. the smell took forever to wash off my hands after. months later i'll get a whiff out of nowhere. that disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

i take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking the entire time, like fucking gollum. saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. look at that beautiful pussy. ain't she so fuckin wet?"" nonstop. meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. like i said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, i managed to perform to a degree but i never did finish. it probably didn't help i was wearing a condom but i'm extremely glad i was. the entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""how the fuck am i getting home? this smell is going to kill me. how do i end this? how do i get out of here?""

i decided it was time, i had to get the fuck out of there asap. i told them i couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. they insisted i put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. i just wanted to make it look like i at least tried. if the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. i pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. i stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. i politely reiterated i wasn't going to be able to finish. i blamed it on my tires being popped and i was too tired. they were cool about it, and i quickly gathered my things and left.

i barely had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. so we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. my hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers i took and how many times i washed them. i blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what i did. it took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200b;

tldr; drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

&#x200b;

edit: i'm really glad i was able to make a lot of you laugh, even if it's at my own expense, i'm laughing with you. a lot of you have kind things to say and it means quite a lot, thank you. i hope anybody that can relate to the self destructive mindset finds happiness.",4
"by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital nsfw. i'm still trying to process what just happened. today was my daughters 19th birthday and i wanted to surprise her by coming home early with a cake. i brought the cake home, slowly tip-toed to her room to surprise her and heard something i will never unhear. she was having sex with her boyfriend and saying ""please stop it hurts, stop it."" i ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. i was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. i threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. my daughter was frantically explaining to me that it's a fetish and he wasn't actually hurting her. i told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and i rushed him to the hospital. he's doing okay now and isn't suffering any major injuries but i feel awful. i'm not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and i truly thought he was hurting her.

"by rubbing my ass into a security guard's crotch... out of habit.. normally, students can beep into my school with an id card.

it's rfid, and pretty reliable, so most people don't take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.

i'm a junior, and i've been getting into the building the same way for years. i keep my id card in my back pocket, so i just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. that sounds a little weird to write, but i promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and i'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.

only issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. as a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our id out to show him as we walked in.

coming in at 8:00am, after years of habit... i was on autopilot.

i approached the security guard, he said, ""id?"" and i nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (obviously i didn't hear the beep, so i guess my brain thought i wasn't close enough to the ""reader""?)

it all took about two seconds, and when i felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, i suddenly realized what i was doing... but before i could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all ""woah woah woah! miss! i just the need the id, please, not a lap dance!"" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.

i tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. couple of other students saw so i'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.

tl;dr: decided i could bribe my way into school without an id by giving the security guard a lapdance... i was right.",4
"by deleting reddit's #1 top post of all time. happened just now. sorry for my possible slips as english is not my mothertongue. i mostly only lurk around, but this time i decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.

i've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. usually when i get depressed at home i start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because i like keeping things clean but removing my so to say ""traces"" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. 

see, since i'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's ""accounts"" folder and terminating the ones i don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). the thing is i used to have an imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so i decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since i didn't get it by registering at the service directly. i'll omit the details of all the cyber sex i went through with my keyboard and the browser, but i somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so i pretty much forgot about the whole deal. but little did i know.

later in the day i get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. in addition to that i still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. being the total jackass of an idiot that i am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, i decide to google the #1 top reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on imgur (yeah, the one about the senate, with a total of whole damn 310k updoots). i open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise satan himself. of course imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? it can't be this bugged, right? (i hadn't clicked one by then yet). so i click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this tifu.

i'm sorry. i didn't want to. please, forgive me everyone.

"by eating a free gumball..  

i'm 23 years old, and i admittedly deserved this for my cheap, filthy ways.

earlier today i was in a grocery store with a friend who was finishing up a transaction with the cashier. during that time, instead of just breaking change at the register like a normal human being, i thought i would casually walk over by the gumball machines to check for free candy, maybe someone put in a quarter and forgot to collect their reward?

i checked four candy dispensers; all empty. one last chance. i opened up the very last dispenser, and to my joyous, dirty surprise, i find a delicious blue gumball just waiting to be devoured. without any thought or inspection, i excitedly tossed it in my mouth and bit down. at the exact moment of impact from my teeth to the gumball, blue paint bursts all throughout my mouth and starts flowing down my face…someone put a motherfucking paintball in the gumball machine's dispenser.

so there i am, a sad, teary eyed grown man in a heavily populated grocery store, freaking out in disgust as i spit blue paint out of my mouth by the candy machines. i'm certain i looked ridiculous, and i'm still brushing my teeth.

"by chuckling away being overpaid.. obligatory ""this concluded today"" - i've been working for uncle sam for about 7 years now. i'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day i received a letter from dfas (the guys who actually pay us) that i was overpaid two whole cents.

silly i thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which i could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, the man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - it was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

laughing it off i taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom i work for and why i should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you f-35), and forgot about it. a month later, two weeks ago i get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address xxxxx, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

now i'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before i ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now i'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. being the class a humorous guy that i am, i send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, i kunted et al myself. i lobe me job."" covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

this was a bad play because apparently feds have no sense of humor.

two weeks later, one week ago i got called into my officer's office. not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, i was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

i'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""me, mind explaining to me why i received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, they spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so i thought i'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. patriotism, y'know sir?""

""well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - we need these floors clean for reason and were looking for a class a go-getter to clean them.

apparently captains have no sense of humor either.

until tonight, i've been spending my free time mopping a lot of floor space.

"by wearing a halloween costume to school. this is a case of me being a chronic dumbass.

i thought that because it was halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but nope!

not a soul.

nobody wore or did anything to celebrate. i know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion i spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. i'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state i'm only at school like 50% of the time, and i thought ""maybe this time i can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy halloween.

its safe to say i was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if i see someone else with a costume on i might feel better but this was overkill, i'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that i likely wont be made fun of but costuming will always be my passion and someday i will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

"by buying a bottle of wine at the movies. went to fancy movie theater with date. decide to buy a bottle of wine. go back to bar. ask for two glasses. bartender says he needs two id's. i'm too lazy to go back to seats to grab dates id. tell him i'm alone and was embarrassed to ask for just one glass. he is clearly sympathetic. idiot me then tries to sell the story and continue on about how lonely i've been recently. he tells me he's off in a few minutes and insists on watching the movie with me. i try to fight it but i could only argue so much without giving away the truth. bartender is insistent. i text my date what's happening. go back to theater with my new date. sit a few rows in front of my first date. she has the stupidest grin on her face as me and the bartender (jared) sit a couple rows in front of her. he ends up being super cool and bought me and him another bottle during the movie. movie ends. i thank him for his gesture. he didn't even ask for my number or anything. i think jared was just a genuine guy trying to comfort someone. met back up with my date in the parking lot and thankfully she found the whole thing hilarious.

i don't deserve jared.",4
"by looking up my school bully. so a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when i was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. i struggled like hell because i didn't speak a single word of english. the school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while i was there). anyway, i tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. one guy just completely hated my guts from day one. no idea why or what i did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. so that's he kind of person i'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my english in class, in front of the teachers and all. there was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while i was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. i naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. when to leave school and which exist to use. where to sit in class etc. once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. i just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  the only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. i would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. karma has to work right? the world can't be that unfair. 

fast forward 15 years. i haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. i didn't make any friends and i didn't develop stockholm's. i looked him up on facebook. 

he owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. he lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. he is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. this has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and i just can't get over the bullshit i was fed, karma will get him for you. i think karma missed. 

tldr: looked up my school bully and he is doing way better than i ever will.",4
"by being oblivious to the notes my fiancee has been writing me.. obligatory ""it's 7 am. this didn't happen today, but very recently."" i have been packing a lunch for work for about the past two months. i pack it usually, but if i'm behind schedule, my fiancee will sometimes help or do it for me.

i got home from work, and we were talking about how the day went. she asked me how lunch was, and i told her it was good and thanked her again. after a pause, she kinda laughed and said ""did you like the note today?!""

puzzled, i told her i didn't know what she was talking about. she said ""the note. the one i put it your lunch today."" i told her i didn't see a note. but the way she said ""today"" made it feel like this wasn't the first time. i said ""wait. have you written me a note before?""

she said ""yes. have you never seen them?"" so apparently this is the 9th note she has written on a napkin, and i've thrown every one in the trashcan at work.

"by stripping in front of my girlfriends bff's nsfw. it's as stupid as it sounds.

yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her bffs. they usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

around that time i'm usually at the gym so to not disturb them. but yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so i went there an hour earlier.

sometimes after i come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
so i come home early and hear the tv running and i assumed, that she didn't hear me.
that's when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

i busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. some get red and look away, some stare at me like they've never seen a man's privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved wtf. 

the silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. i uttered a loud fuck and she instantly replied with: „good plan, bad execution."" her friends all laughed and even i had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

i even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

tl;dr: busted naked into my so's girl evening.

"by labeling the breast milk in the fridge ""freshly squeezed titty juice"". the repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.

my wife and i have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment it came out.  we found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

while i was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  that rest was very short lived.  the baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

when she read ""freshly squeezed titty juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  she woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  raised with no manners or respect.  she then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

my wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  she passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

i didn't get upset because i'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

tl;dr  i labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  now i have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks i embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days.",4
"by accidentally buying tickets to the red hot chili pipers not peppers. few years back i was a bit drunk and saw online that the ""red hot chili pipers"" were playing in edinburgh...i thought it was the red hot chili peppers! £30 for a ticket i thought it was a bargain! bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time).

i am a huge fan of the red hot chili peppers and i was super stoked to finally see them in edinburgh! most bands play in glasgow so i couldnt believe my luck when i saw they were playing in my city!

so we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then i heard some bagpipe music was playing.

i thought hmm interesting...not what i expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in scotland and the capital city i really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

about an hour in i was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but i was waiting for the red hot chili peppers to come out so i could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

i turned to the man next to me and asked when the red hot chili peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

it was at this moment i realised i was not going to see the red hot chili peppers.

tl;dr: bought tickets to the red hot chili pipers thinking it was the red hot chili peppers.

"by putting a rock in my ear, then leaving it for roughly 13 years.. bit of context; i was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. i'm 26 now. 

well it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and i had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. it's where i got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?

while i sat amongst rubble and dirt, i had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.

again, i wasn't bright. 

well. i drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.

that said, i flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly i can't remove it. not a single adult was even aware i was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.

so when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.

i lost my mind.

my dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. whatever really.

either way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that i was overreacting.

okay. sure.

let's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and i'm in highschool.

this is where the real fun begins. equalbrium (equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. i could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. was a nightmare, really.

i get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that ""imaginary rock"" i had long ago forgotten.

all i hear is scrapes.

scrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.

i'll admit, i immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. that's another topic entirely.

well wouldn't you know, though? the doctor said i was faking, examined my ear, and said i just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. right. it was probably june at the time.

my mom didn't really believe him, but i decided ""balls to it. let's get some hydro-perox!"", because fuck hospitals really.

skip along the years a bit more, i'm 18 and i know for a fact there is something in-my-fucking-head. i'm losing it. so i hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, ""there's definitely blockage. i'm not sure if it's a rock, but i can certainly try to help.""

so this professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of scissor-hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. it was audio torture, hands down. rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.

the end results? ""you'll need to see a specialist"", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.

i'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.

the sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and i began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when i reflect back.

let's time jump one last time. i'm 22, couple months away from 23, i have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. great.

but now, out of the blue, i'm losing hand-eye coordination. well damn, you know? i attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.

i lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that i could dig this chunk of earth out myself.

three different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. but that last one was phased from the situation immediately.

this was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and i locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.

eventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. in an instant i froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.

jackpot.

now, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.
the pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like i was passing a kidney stone from my skull.

all in all, 2/10. wouldn't do again.

but now it's totally out and i have it put away in a ziplock bag.

i had no real recovery issues i guess. as soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. now it just rings occasionally.

my balance won't ever be the same i feel, but it's fine enough as is. otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, i have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and i get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.

not a bad trade out.

size reference(https://i.imgur.com/xaxleg9.png)

&nbsp;

**_edit_**: for everyone calling me an idiot, trust me i know. for everyone concerned about my follow through, it was 3 years ago and i've been to the hospital between then and now for basic check-ups and have mentioned the stoned-ear before. it's fine. this is why i can laugh it off.

**_another edit_**: 9yrs old at the beginning, 22 at the removal. had to check a few timestamps.

i'm currently 26.

also, spelling

&nbsp;

tldr: i put a rock in my ear at 9yrs old, went to two doctors, one didn't believe me, the other couldn't help. pulled it out myself after 13 years when i was 22 and now i can't swim underwater, storm cells give me minor headaches, and i have poor balance.",4
"by making a grown man cry at my work. i debated whether or not this belongs here cause it's more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. but my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

sidenote: this happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

i work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. i had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. he was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes i get who tend to speak down to me just because i'm a girl who works in a hardware store. anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so i said i could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. he agrees and he opens his wallet and i notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. trying to make conversation i decide to comment on it:
(op: me | og: old guy)

op: oh is that your granddaughter? she's so cute!

og: oh no... that's my daughter.

*fuck, i basically just implied this guy was old.*

og: oh cool! she's really cute! what grade is she in?

*guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

og: she's dead. she was hit by a car. a week after the picture was taken 

in my mind i fucking panicked. i literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. and this is what i came up with:

op: oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! it's too bad she died!

the guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. in record time i get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""have a nice day!"" and he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

guys. 

i told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

and that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" that's what my fucking brain came up with. 
fml.

tl;dr - subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**update: holy shit.**

i did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

to answer a few comments: 
*why didn't you just say 'i'm sorry' and move on?*

because that would of been the smart thing to say and as i have referenced, i am a complete and utter dumbass. also, i am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so i was trying to backpeddle as fast as i could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*why would you comment on the kids picture? that's weird.*

yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. but like i said i am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. this happened when i was still pretty new to the job and i had never worked in retail before so i wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. after this happened i learned my lesson and i have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*why do you work in customer service? you clearly don't belong in that department.*

like i said this happened a few years ago when i was still pretty new and i have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. i now train people for the job and i am also a assistant supervisor of the department. i usually tell newbies this story when i am training them so they don't make the same mistake as i did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*did you ever apologize to the guy?*

no, and that's the one thing i regret most of all. i've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. i truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. while i'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

"by suggesting to my bf that he get testicle implants. i've been dating this guy for a few months. he has a fetish for petite asian girls, that i know. but he also has a thing for big breasts, which i attribute to his ""hentai porn"" fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. 

in the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. he would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me i'd be ""perfect"" if i got some saline implants to fill a dd cup, as a ""joke"" of course. (dd is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34c, but still insulting to me.)

so i finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. i told him most petite asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. he did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great i'd look in a double d while we were out having brunch. 

so i snapped, and i said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. well he didn't take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. he hasn't returned any of my texts since. 

tl;dr: i underestimated how fragile my bf's ego is concerning his balls and i insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.

edit/update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. i tried calling him to apologize since he's ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(

more edit: i'm very sorry if i gave the wrong impression of him here. words are very limited. he really is a good guy otherwise. i know and i hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. but i really like him (and his balls big or small!). i did not mean to hurt him this deeply and i'm just so sad right now that i hurt him this much. i feel like a terrible person. i shouldn't have reacted with cattiness that i didn't even mean because i like his balls just the way they are!

one last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies. not sure where this will go but i guess i'll see.",4
"watching incest porn. *throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

this happened yesterday. i was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. i will state, for the record, i do not advocate incest. my girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. all i wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so i went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. that's all this was. research. 

so, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. of all people. if there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment i look straight into it. i answered the phone. the old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

cut to my dad and i driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. then, there came the silence. it wasn't the awkward kind. but i guess we just kinda said enough at the time. my father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. he was in the mood to get jiggy with jeezy. but instead of hearing voices worshipping the og upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital q&a: 

*""you like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

my old man unknowingly activated the car's bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever i was listening to last. in this case, it was fucking incest porn. now, i never closed the video before i left the house, but i did pause the motherfucker. yet, somehow, my phone went skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

i frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what i do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

dad: suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids.

i immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home.

"by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp. technically yesterday and not today, but yifu sounds like some odd anime genre so...

so it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. i was dropping her off at about 8ish and i was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. for the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

anyway, stopped at the summer camp. my daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. i signed my daughter in and then i.... just drove off. in my defense, well, i got nothing. honestly, i just forgot the dog there.

so my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. i now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). she also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. she got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. all in all, could have gone worse.

edit - i get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  sorry, but no can do.  pics include other people's kids and i'm not going to post that.  also, i think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and i've said way too much shit i regret on reddit for that to happen.  just use your imaginations.  she's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  she's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

edit 2 - for those asking.  yes, camp called me.  twice.  and left vm's both times.  number was not one i recognized so i didn't pick up or check vm (i know, tifu!  number is now programmed in).  both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if i could come pick the dog up.  i clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  and yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  huge huge props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

edit 3 - for those asking.  i did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  so i left them an awesome review on yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

edit 4 - yah, i get it.  this could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  yes, it was a mistake on my side.  that's why i'm posting it here and not on r/todayiwasawesome

edit 5 - holy crap.  came back to see this hit the front page and my inbox has 500 messages.  i just want to take a moment and say thank you to my mom and dad for having sex with each other and making this moment possible.  

tl;dr - dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. dog had a great time and i think she's now a camp counselor.",4
"by having my roomate walk in while i was practicing cowgirl riding.... oof

my roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on sunday night. she usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

a week ago, i ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. i don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. so this was fucking fantastic and i was ecstatic.

my plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so i could sit on it and act like it was my bf. i'm not really experienced in the sex department and i wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so i was going to practice until she got back.

before i get into the main event. i need to explain the layout of this house. when opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that used to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. after leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. however since we got it fixed it's silent.

now on to the main event. i had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so i could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. then i pulled out my new toy and i literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

then i got dressed down to what i would be wearing. it was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath i had my lingerie, i did this so i would be in the head space and so i could i imagine the upcoming day.

at this point i'm on the toy and i had a pretty good groove going and i was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so i grabbed some pillows to support, and then i heard a noise. i fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! i shoo'd him out and continued.

another couple minutes go by and i can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. until i realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. i then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and i felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. i heard the suitcase stop and when it did i hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. i was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

lightbulb!

my shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! i sat myself right back down, turned the tv on rick and morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like i had been watching this the entire night.

she came in and saw me and asked why i was sitting like that and i made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and i was just letting it stretch out. she nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that i was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

we sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. she told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

at this point i'm so sore and by sheer will i'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

the moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. i reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. she does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  i pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


tl;dr: tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

update 1: thanks so much for the lovely gold! it's my first one and it makes me happy! for the record, i am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. i haven't told my bf yet since i'm still a bit embarrassed! but i'm planning on telling him on the day. also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

update 2: since it's being asked alot, the reason i was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. i was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. so there were boxes and all that jazz.

update: i tried keeping up with all the comments... i give lol my pupper has been posted in r/aww",4
"buying my son's halloween candy away from him. my kids go trick or treating. we live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. 

when they're young we tell them santa brings every boy and girl a present on halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he'd leave in exchange. 

when the kids get old enough to realize santa is a hoax, that's when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. 

did this with our oldest two and it worked great. they'd give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. 

our third child is 8 this year so called us out on the santa thing. we explained the new deal. 

he said ""so then it's my money and i can buy *whatever* i want with it? a new skateboard even? *anything*?"" ""you bet."" ""swear?"" ""yep."" 

he goes and brings us **all** his candy. even every kit kat, his favorite. i was shocked, but he'd been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must've decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. 

getting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 i'd spent all week. 

next day i brought the candy to work. then we went to walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. we met at the check out. 

there's my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred kit kats for $10.00. 

i started to tell him to put it back, but he said ""what? you said i could buy *whatever* i wanted! you swore! i want my candy back then."" 

his candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. and i did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. 

so... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. 

i don't know who's more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this. 

*tl;dr i bought my son's halloween candy back from him to get the sugar out of the house. he spent the money on twice as much candy as he had gotten trick or treating.*

"by complimenting a co-worker on his weight loss. this happened just moments ago.

i have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  in my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions i rarely see him.  it has been about a year and a half since i have seen him and i was surprised to see him in my area today.  he has lost about a hundred pounds so i thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  i said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  he responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  we aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which i was completely expecting as i awkwardly stood in the hallway.  

when i got back into my office i brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  my office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.  

tl;dr i enthusiastically complimented a co-worker about his weight loss, got a cold response, then learned he was diagnosed with cancer.",4
"by swiping on lesbians on tinder for 2 months.. this has been going on for two months and i just found out today. throwaway account because many know my real account and i don't feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. 

so i signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. i set up my account...set my interest in 'women' and started swiping. now when i signed up for tinder i linked my facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if i set my gender to woman. i had completely forgot. i'm not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but i was getting barely any matches and couldn't figure out why. figured the algorithms were just screwing me. over the course of the two months i would think ""wow short hair must be the new thing"" or ""so many bisexuals on here"" but never really thought anything beyond that. then this morning i woke up to a new match. she said i looked great, to which i replied thanks, you too! but then she replied with...""how long ago did you transition?"" i thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. that's when it all came together and i realized i've been swiping on lesbians the entire time.

tldr; my 13 year-old self is an asshole.

edit: i am not 13 years old, that's when i made a facebook. i am 25.",4
"by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong'. this happened about a week ago. it still gives me shivers.

obviously, i never thought this would happen to me of all people.

i spent a lot of money on the app store and i think they blocked my card and so i had to call them up to restore my account.

a female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. even at this point i had no clue what was coming. until she asked,

""what is your most prized possession?""

i froze. my head goes blank not because i forgot what i had written for the answer, but because i knew exactly what i had written. the answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

i wanted to hang up right then and there, but i knew she was looking at the answer i had written.

so, i mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""i'm sorry? you have to speak up sir, i can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (fuck), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (fucking kill me)""

""dong schlong. thank you, sir.""

i was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

i've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and i had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

edit:

holy mother of schlong this blew up... thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

and yes, looking back, i should've definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. but this had never happened to me and i think i just panicked. i'll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.

gold?? platinum? seriously?? wow, you guys made my day. i'll make sure to keep my shiny medals clean and sparkling :)",4
"by closely following a woman around a lingerie store. this happened just today. i (male) was in a lingerie store with my girlfriend, she was shopping for new underwear and i was just following her around, bored as always, staring at my phone to keep myself occupied.

after about 5-10 minutes a man grabs my arm, i turn and it's the security guard. he asks me to leave and starts escorting me towards the exit. i'm confused about what's happening and look around for my girlfriend, who i can't find.

apparently at some point, while not paying attention to anything other than my phone, i'd stopped following my girlfriend (who was wearing a white cardigan and black trousers) and instead had started following some other random woman who was wearing similar clothes. i'd apparently been doing this for at least a few minutes, silently standing closely behind her as she browsed underwear and following her to do it again as she tried to move away. she'd alerted a member of staff with a horrified look towards them.

tl;dr started following a stranger who i thought was my girlfriend and creeped them out",4
"by asking for vagina in a japanese convenience store. for context, i'm on a vacation to japan and has been staying at my friend's apartment for 3 days. to show a bit of gratitude, i wanted to cook for her so i decided to go for something simple like a chicken katsu.

i've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. this is the moment i realized that i was out of breadcrumbs so i have to go to the convenience store to get some. i am somewhat decent in japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? no.

as i walked in the store, i couldn't find the breadcrumbs i was looking for so i decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

me: ""sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

at this point i didn't realize that i mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". the staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking i was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. i repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. after the change of the staff's expression, i realized that i fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. i then explained that i mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

tl;dr i mistaken the word panko(breadcrumbs) for the word manko(pussy) asked a convenience store staff for pussy",4
"by leaving a dildo on the table and ruining my sons life. this happened saturday night into sunday morning but my shame has subsided enough for me to write this out. also no throwaway because whatever. 

we have a 12 yr old son. 

saturday night after he went to bed, husband and i decided to get a little sex in. after quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the ""toy"" box. husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (he was putting new batteries in them, etc). he comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. we wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says ""what is that on the table?!""
...i immediately realized the fu. husband did not so he asks ""what is it?"" 
son: a purple banana (ps he's 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
cue immediate shame/laughter. i wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

side note. we did not use that particular ""purple banana"" that night-thank god. 

after we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says ""what do you want for breakfast?"" 
son says ""i lost my appetite"" 

i'm still dying inside. i'm sure son is too.

tl;dr left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won't ever be the same.

edit: ok guys-you realize it's 2019, the internet is alive and well, and 7th grade 12yr old boys are exploring etc right?! it's not crazy that he knows what dildos are.

also edit: i didn't treat it like it was shameful and i know i didn't actually ruin his life. but no one wants to think of their parents having sex. we laughed about it afterwards and made purple banana jokes the rest of the day. we are open and communicate etc. i was mortified and still am, because it's embarrassing.",4
"by letting this subreddit devolve into a collection of creative erotica writing assignments meta. i don't know if meta threads are allowed, but i think this needs to be said. i believe the removal of the ""nsfw only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. the majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting tifus that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, tifus that are actually not tifus at all and serve only as humble brags - by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool i am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.

when you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling op out for the story obviously being fake/barely a (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so i really doubt i am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.

tl;dr: personally i think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the nsfw weekend rule. these post clearly have their audience so i have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. however i don't think it's fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day.",4
"by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that i had to be rescued. then i did something really embarrassing.. 


a few years ago i spent a saturday blissfully tripping by myself. i had dosed that afternoon and i started coming down as the sun was coming up. it was a bright, crisp morning and i felt completely at peace. i was shuffling my music and sunday morning by the velvet underground came on. it was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

i suddenly made a decision. i had to make some changes. i had to get my fat ass to the gym.

i was surprised to see so many people. i had thought, hey, 7am on a sunday, i'll have the run of the place. i was obviously incorrect. all the cardio machines were taken. i couldn't just stand there. i was already getting sweaty and i'd been so high for so long so recently.

i saw an empty bench press and went for it. i couldn't remember what i used to bench back in school so i decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. i am 6'2 and 250 lbs. i was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

it was heavier than i imagined. i figured my guns were rusty. i decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. it was all i could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. i let it sit on my chest while i came up with a plan. every time i tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. i decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. with momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. perfect. i tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

the bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. i lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. if anyone heard it, they ignored it. despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. it hurt. i slowed my breathing and just relaxed. it'll be ok, i thought. i got this, i prayed.

*brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

nope, it's bad, this is bad. everyone had to have heard the rounds i let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. the volume was incredible. no one knew i was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. no one laughed. time was frozen but i assume only a few minutes passed. finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. he looked up at me with genuine concern.

""hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............whhhoooooooot.*

to his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. more like a twitch. i nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. i tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. he left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. all i wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. like i wasn't bothered at all.

so, knowing i was being observed, i did this. i stood tall, nodded to myself like i nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *alright*

**fuck.**

**me.**

the door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. i ran to my car.

i can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. there is nothing funny about the clap. it pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp. i just wanted to look like a normal human being.

tl;dr i went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak i am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until i was rescued. then i pretended i had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *alright* as if i could alter reality by sheer force of will.",4
"by being young and dumb i guess. *i was 16 when this happened. golden age of fuck ups.* 

i hooked up with one of the girls from my church. we were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. i was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the big g. however the two of us shared one common goal. we wanted to fuck. which we did. but afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". she named and shamed both of us. none of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. 

so thanks to that confession, that's how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the deacon's daughter. 

*edit: thank you for the silver & gold!* 

*edit: okay, gawd damn. some of you are sick of all the sex posts. noted.* 

*edit: a few of you are asking how my old man reacted. every second or third weekend he dragged my ass to prison, where he would occasionally preach the word of god. being there scared the shit out of me and he knew that. i was forced to listen to ""rehabilitated"" rapists and murderers read scriptures out of the bible and give me lessons on what it meant to be born again and to live a pure life in christ... free from temptation, sin, all the shit 16 year old me was guilty of that time. i never had sex with the deacon's daughter ever again.*

**tl:dr made ungodly love to a christian girl. she went crazy with guilt and confessed all our filthy fornicating to the pastor of our church. aka my dad.**",4
"by falling asleep then waking up while my roommate bought his date back.. this happened many years ago! but it still an experience that brings a few laughs. (tl:dr at the bottom)

back in college, i shared a room with a 4'9 dude and he was nice man. he would always leave everything spotless, he was an amazing wingman and he always managed to make sure that when we had a few people over that they'd all have food readily available and drinks etc. he was so cool. anyway, he told me he was going to have a date and asked if i'd be going to my friends house for the night (he didn't live too far and i had been talking about meeting him one of the days) i was like ""yeah maybe, ohhh i see you want the room tonight i got you don't worry"". so he's all nervous about his date and i give him a pep talk i said ""you're a good man, your dates gonna be great and you definitely look ace!"" he was all hyped up and left. 

i called my buddy and asked if he was at home, he was actually at work. but, he told me he'll be back home within a couple hours or so. now, my roommate who was on his date told me he would ring or text me to let me know he got back safe to the room and to give me the heads up when to leave. 

so, i figured i got plenty of time. i laid on the bed and basically waited for two hours to go by to get a phone call from my buddy to tell me he had finished work. but, i instead get a text message from him saying he had finished work and that he'll be getting home a lot later than expected. still no sign from my roommate on his date though (who said he'll ring/message me if he's bringing his date back)

then *i ended up falling asleep*

again after waiting for my buddy to message me when he's free to meet. after some time passes i begin to wake up a little because i hear some distorted voices, giggling and bed creaking . i'm like ""oh fuck"" he's with his date, him and her are gonna be pissed if i ruin their night now by waking up, ""why didn't he text me or ring?!!"". so, i stayed stationary and pretended to be asleep. i hear them both get outta bed and lay on the floor (i imagine cause of the bed creaking). i then start to hear the almighty thunderous clapping of balls and i'm seriously trying to hold my laughter in _but_ then i i heard moaning like a japanese anime character.. which confused me. anyway at this point i'm still trying to hold my laughter in, i realised i had knocked my phone near the edge of the bed because of my inability to keep my composure, so i decided to try and grab it splinter cell lock picking style. i grab the phone without being noticed and in that moment curiosity got the better of me. the ball slamming stopped and it went quiet so i decided then take a slight peak to see if him and his date was asleep and if the coast was clear.. *nope!* as i opened my eye all i see is a 6'7, huge bald black dude followed by the deepest male voice i've ever heard in my entire life say ""now say you want more now"" and continue the almighty thunderous ball slamming i see my 4'9 roommate getting absolutely destroyed up and down like a goddamn yo yo waving his arms in the sky like when you was a kid and needed a piss but you was in class and you had to raise your hand impatiently to get the teachers attention to go to the bathroom. i again stayed stationary as possible with tears of laughter running down my eyes. all the business stopped and the behemoth of a man left the dorm and my roommate just went straight to bed humming. 

the next day i got up early, showered and decided to get mcdonalds breakfast for myself and my roommate and a strong coffee (believe me, even i felt exhausted after all of that). i come back to the room to see my roommate watching tv as if nothing happened whatsoever. i said ""well tell me about the date? was she nice?"" whilst he grinned and ate his sausage mcmuffin. he just looked at me and said ""it was so much fun we're going to meet again very soon"". 

now, i didn't want to say anything because his sexuality is his business and he'll say when the time was right (he did a month later). so, i said ""i'm glad you had a good time"". as i leave the room and make my way down the hallway, what do i see?? the behemoth black dude walking down hallway with the look of a man on a mission, literally like terminator as he walks through the hallway of the psychiatric hospital. i took a last glance through the window while the dude made his way to my room. so, when my friend said ""we're going to meet again _soon_"" little did i know it would be less than 10 hours from the other night. but at least this time they had all the privacy they wanted and i didn't have to almost die of laughter. 

tl;dr - roommate went on a date, brought back home his date, didn't know his date was another dude, i fell asleep and eventually woke up to see him getting destroyed by a dude the size of bob sapp(https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/071/282/bobsapp_crop_north.jpg?1357083029&amp;w=630&amp;h=420) who came back less than 10 hours later for round two. and i'm 99% certain he ate my mcdonalds hashbrown that i left on the side.

"by fucking my bf into a seizure. i'm going to preface this by saying, no, this didn't actually happen today. it has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.

it was our first valentine's day together this year. i woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.

i decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. it was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

i needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

this is when things begin to go wrong.

all of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. i glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (he has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


sure enough, he began to violently seize. i go full protective mode and try to help him. he was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

we're both still naked and i have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. 

fight or flight kicks in and i know i must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. i'm on the smaller side, being 5'6 and around 125lbs. so when my actively seizing bf (6'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, i go balls to the walls.

i grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting

*clack*


once he's back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it's dislocated. i drive him to the hospital
and sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. i apologized profusely to my man, who responded

""babe you fucked me into a seizure..i'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.""
so not only, on our first valentine's day together did i literally fuck him into a seizure, but i also dislocated his shoulder. 

tldr: had sex with boyfriend that had a seizure afterwards, tried to turn him on his side and dislocated his shoulder in the processs.",4
"by telling my three year old daughter that i would eat her booty. alright so let's start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you'll be like wtf? 

so my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  and more accurately it's more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife ""mommy, get my booty! get my booty mom"" and off to the races they go. 

obviously this is a game that both parents play and she'll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. this get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it's cute and we haven't gotten any feedback on it.

this brings us to last night. the wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells ""get my booty daddy!"" to which i reply nonchalantly ""i'm going to eat your booty! nom nom nom"" since her butt was right next to my face. 

i immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling ""eat my booty daddy! eat my booty"" and takes off running. dear lord, what have i done?! i try to go into damage control and revert back to get your booty, but it's too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

i took her to daycare this morning, i hope she forgot all about it. i'm dreading picking her up.

tl;dr my daughter yells get my booty to initiate games of tag. with her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face i instead say i'm going to eat your booty! she now yells eat my booty to initiate the game instead. 

edit: a word. also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

there were lots of requests for an update after pickup. all is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. 

for those that got offended, sorry? none of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. cheers!",4
"by getting in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. so this actually happened about a week and a half ago. some pre knowledge. i dated my next door neighbor for about a year and a half, but then we eventually broke up. so the other day i was really hungry and wanted some panda express orange chicken. i texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. i was like ""alright sounds good brother see you in a bit"". 
a couple minutes later a car rolls up in front of my house. so naturally i got went out and got in thinking that it was my friend. i got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, ""ummm you're not my girlfriend,"" quickly i looked up and realized ""oh god i am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. i started to unbuckle and get out. i opened the door and heard a thunk. now i'm thinking to myself ""oh god i just hit the door against the curb but when i looked up it turns out i actually hit my ex with the door. quickly i apologized and got out and waited for my friend inside my house.

"by listening to reddit and eating my girlfriends ass, which caused a peanut allergy.. my girlfriend and i have been together for about a year and a half. she is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but i've always told myself that i would never eat ass. i just think it's unsanitary and just gross. but she's dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but i've always deflected it. i decided i might finally give it a try, maybe it won't be so bad. if it's something she would really enjoy it, why not? but then a concerning thought entered my head.

i have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend loves paydays, the peanut candy bars. there is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. i wasn't sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. so i decided to ask reddit.

most of the replies said that it shouldn't be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let's go for it.

she gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. it wasn't quite as bad as i thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. but after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and i could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

i pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her i'd be right back and ran to the bathroom. this obviously made her very self conscience. i was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when i came back i looked like will smith from hitched when he eats the seafood. 

i had to explain to her that i was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. she told me i didn't ever have to do it again, so i guess there's a silver lining to the story.

tldr: i have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.

"by causing an explosion 40,000ft above the atlantic ocean on an international flight.. i was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from delhi to london, so i quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as i ran to the boarding gate.

about 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the tvs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

i can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. it didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. the people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

after a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. my travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

as it turns out, in india they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. they're also dirt cheap, so i bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks i'd grabbed in a rush earlier). the pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

and **that** is how i accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.

tl;dr: i made the mistake of squashing lots of hyper inflated chip packets into my bag on a flight and they all exploded. everyone lost their minds.",4
"by sleeping with my landlord. okay so this happened over the weekend and today. 
on friday, i went to view an apartment. i had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. 
so i see the apartment, everything's great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. 

i get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. i'm going to go in on monday to sign the lease. 

okay so now it's saturday night and i'm just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let's call him steve
he messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. 

so monday rolls around and i go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends

i walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. 

the woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve's wife. steve looks totally chill, while i'm freaking outside but trying to remain calm. i did not sign up for this.

"by unknowingly doping for the entire school year. this has been in the making since last september. this is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

late last summer i started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. i'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

though i've always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call i needed to start working out. beside hitting the gym, i also joined a sharpshooting club, and was i was natural at it. over the course of a few months i moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. my aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

i'm pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but i sure as hell didn't. in the meantime a cardiologist said ""tough shit"" and bumped up the meds.

during the course of this school year i was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. the stakes were high, but i was a stone cold shooter. later that day checking out my fitbit, i found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when i had to bicycle over the the range.

flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. my friend jokingly mentioned that i must've been doping to do so well and the dots connected. i googled ""metoprolol doping"", there it was. i still haven't told anyone, but reddit. what the hell do i do now?

tl:dr started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug.",4
"twice by grabbing a new coworkers boob and then forgetting her husband died.    happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. on wednesday's our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it's a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. it is normal to carpool all together and naturally i drive my two friend-coworkers each time. however this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we'll call her sarah (changed). she's quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. while everyone is leaving the office for lunch i offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. now here's where the first fuck up happens.
   while on the way to the restaurant sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. traffic comes to a halt and i slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. i check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing i am currently full on honkin sarah's right knocker my words start to trail off. ""damn i hope everyone is oka....."" that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that i was just reacting to the situation. for the next few minutes the car was silent until sarah said ""that's funny i haven't had that much action in a while"" which eased the mood and the car all laughed. and fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying ""ahh well we all have our dry spells."" something i thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. she goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. 
   we get to lunch and everything seems okay but sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so i ask what's up. she told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. i instantly apologized saying i had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that i was sorry. she said she didn't care about that and that it was fine it's just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. my heart sunk. i had completely forgotten about her husband. i felt so bad i instantly started apologizing for everything in the world i felt horrible. my friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. i feel so horrible that i have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. please reddit help me feel a little better.

"nsfw by posting a video of me masturbating to my work group chat. 

okay so this literally just happened. im dying slowly from the embarrassment, and cant believe it happened to me. 

on snapchat we have a work group chat that i post on pretty frequently. well tonight my so asked me to send her a video of me masturbating cause she gets off on that and we haven't been able to see each other in a couple days do to our schedules. i always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn't have a home button. so apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. 

i realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. it wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow 


tl;dr dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat


update: so im not getting fired luckily. im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. ive heard so many michael jackson just beat it references its unreal. the group chat is mostly comprised of people i go to college with. even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. my boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn't post my dick in the groupchat.  also holy fuck this blew up! thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.

"by being on this subreddit too much and hurting my boyfriend's feelings. anyone remember the of the guy that suck his own dick in front of his assistant at a bachelorette party? he included a drawing of how he did that.

so my boyfriend was doing some stretches on bed, and one of the stretches is the same pose as what that guy drew.

i commented about it and said ""hey that's how the guy sucked his own dick."" 

my boyfriend being silly then try to see if he can reach his too and i gave him a little push.
obviously he isn't as flexible (just like how most people are not) and i said;

""well it's okay, he did mention afterall that he also have a big dick""

and in that moment i felt as if time slowed down and i can see his face going into this super disappointed look.

and that is how i fucked up by hurting his feelings.


tl;dr: i told my boyfriend he have a small dick indirectly and unintentionally and hurt his feelings

edit: y'all need to chill. i never did mention that his dick is actually small (and to clarify, hell no it isn't).
to give more context, it all happened in a light hearted and silly mood. sure his feelings probably got hurt for a while (can't deny that horrified look i saw) but obviously i reassured him and we laughed about it. 

reason i posted this is because my boyfriend is the one that casually mentioned about posting here, and i am curious what kind of reaction it'll get

we are now both laughing at how worked up some of you actually got ;)

"by instead of sucking the dick, the dick suck me. today my cousin bought an 8 inch black realistic suction cup dildo as a birthday present for my brother, whom in horror discarded the obscene dingus. being the saint that i am, i adopted this orphaned device. 

my friend and i provided the poor discarded ornament with a purpose, i replaced the toilet roll holder with our new trinket, which worked fabulously. 

however, the mere potential of comical joy to be experienced was wasted on such a mundane destiny, and thus i proceeded to stick the suction end to my forehead and become the unicorn i was meant to be... i had reached my comical peak. as we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead i could feel something was terribly wrong. 

i heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. upon my forehead i had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. the curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm. 

i leave for italy in 8 hours for my summer holiday.... my friends won't be able to look at me in the eyes. i fear for what the security at the airport may think of my battle wound.

"tifu by not understanding that 3.5 grams can be a fuckload. this actually did happen within the last 24 hours, i'm still lying in bed trying to recover. 

so, weed has been legalized, yay canada! obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. my girlfriend and i had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. but we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.

i figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? i mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. fucking harmless. so i spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of mk ultra and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. which were quite good.

we cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. now, i am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. but, i'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *apparently* you should start with 10 mg. see how that goes. but on friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and i didn't feel a damn thing.

we started with two brownies each. two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. i was fine. so i had another one. an hour later, she could barely walk. i didn't feel it as bad as her. so, i had one more. that's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.

turns out mj is a helluva drug. jesus mother-fucking christ. we spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. oh my lawd, i had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. my mind is blown. i could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this ""big deal"" where my girlfriend and i had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!

we were wrecked. about halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. we just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. my girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. she wanted to call an ambulance. none of this is hyperbole. we're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. the dry mouth might've been the worst part. it was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. 

we threw the rest of the brownies out. the smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.

tldr: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. it waaaaaay too much.

edit: thanks for the gold! and silver! and platinum! kinda worth it...?

edit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. i honestly, sincerely hate the waste. but we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. that would be unforgivably irresponsible. 

edit 3: i *did* do research, i just didn't do enough. we have now learned correct math from the comments. you're **supposed** to dose edibles using the thc percentage. this stuff has been tested at 18%. so, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and i had 168... holy fuck.

edit 4: i used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. every 10 minutes i topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. there wasn't much smell at all. i can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.

**final edit**: some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. for those making **positive** contributions, thank you! we're enjoying them! 
1. they say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *wait longer*! like, a day. it is not worth the risk of having too much.
2. there's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.
3. there's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. i fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. so keep that in mind. ",4
"by accidentally dosing myself with lsd at work.. throwaway.  well it was around noon when i ate my pasta.  shortly after that i found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  i initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee i shouldn't have had.  at 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which i always use for some gym time.  as i was walking out of the office i realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  the possibility that i was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  somehow.  life finds a way.  saturday morning i had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent tupperware lid as the backdrop. some of the residue must have lived through the night.  on sunday i made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the tupperware.  i put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  today i ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  or maybe i laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  i'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since i microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. it did though and by the time i had walked to the gym i knew damn well what was coming my way.   well anyway, i went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  the work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, i started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when i didn't know where i was going, or why.  i pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before i had to take the plunge.  i did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  i cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. my behavior was normal except for when i forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  we had a new team-member start today and i had to give her a tour.   i don't think she could tell i was fucked up but i know i was sweating a lot and rambling.  i now have another 50 minutes before i very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  what a fucking monday.

so i was playing re7 in vr, but it was getting kinda late but i wanted to stay up and play anyways. i started to fall asleep, and just passed out kinda instantly.

then i woke up, my head felling weirdly heavy. but holy shit i just woke up and all i can see around me is a dark room with some tables chairs all i can hear are creepy noises and its dark outside and  i have no idea where i am. 

so logically i stand up from my chair( i didn't even check to look, but i'm pretty sure my in game guy was standing) and run and scream.

"by letting my niece and nephew use my psn account, and ruining my girlfriend's holiday.. update post here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu\_update\_letting\_my\_nephew\_use\_my\_fortnite/(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu_update_letting_my_nephew_use_my_fortnite/)   


maybe you already know where this is going.

my niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. they're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. my niece (who we'll call l), and my nephew (who we'll call w) don't have many games on their psn account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle i am, i game them access to my psn account, to play my far superior collection of games.all was well for about a month. i knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.

but imagine my surprise yesterday when i get this message on facebook...

&#x200b;

""a\_sad\_frog, can you check your bank? ""

it was my brother in law. l and w's father.

""w is playing fortnite and he has 65,000 v bucks, is this normal?""

&#x200b;

my heart stopped. their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.i went to my transaction history on psn, and nearly threw up when i saw this(https://imgur.com/a/qzu4scn)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**

&#x200b;

all told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. by the time i got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. i saw that the playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. that's **fu number 1.**""tell them to stop what they're doing. shut off your ps4. i have to sort this out"".

&#x200b;

i immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **nothing**. playstation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. this is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherf\*ng v bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. for all intents and purposes, i have lost that money. the bank can't do anything about it.

so here's where it gets really messed up. **fu number 2**. my girlfriend is visiting family in the us, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. she will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. that was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than i ever could have expected, and far better than i deserved.

i'm not mad at the kids. i genuinely don't think they meant it. i'm mad at myself. i didn't think it was possible, but then i should have done more research. i feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just f'ed. we're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.

so, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on psn are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.

**tldr:** left my playstation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.

**edit:** a couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. this is true, but it's set up on a different email that wasn't set up on our phones to notify us. it would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **fu number 3** confirmed.

"by revealing that i had secretly hid in my roomate's closet during his pre-bedtime ritual. obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

i lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we'll call them ned and ethan. the three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. the most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out adam sandler's at a medium pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (everyone thinks they're hilarious in college, i know).
the most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. but one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in ned's bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of adam sandler on my shitty washburn 6-string. 

trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but ned was no random college student. ned was the 6'3"" milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. in short, ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. so to me, that meant that whenever ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

so i grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he'd think i had went to bed early), and snuck into ned's bedroom to position myself in his closet. it was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, like this(https://cdn.instructables.com/fya/uc2h/hmvja37y/fyauc2hhmvja37y.medium.jpg). ned's bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so i'd have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and ned, in case i accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. but directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was ned's computer and desk. 
ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, i could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. the 12 inch proximity of ned spiked my adrenaline, and i began to control my breathing. my back was pressed against coat hangers, and i had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and i had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. (artist depiction(https://i.imgur.com/xmlm5bh.png))

as ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. ned did not reach for his glass of water. ned did not opt for the pajamas. ned did not leave his desk. ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

a million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. if i make myself known now, he'd be immensely embarrassed and angry that i had just violated his privacy. but if i *didn't* speak up now, chances are i'd have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. so i was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. it felt like i was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

my hands began to cramp as i awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn't generate an ounce of noise. my legs began to jitter as i compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as i waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell i was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

after ned's satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that i had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and i had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. all critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until i remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. but with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would i get the phone out my pocket? somehow i did, and i texted ethan in the next room over:

> foogama: in ned's closet. was trying to do medium pace gag. ned started wanking before i could start. now i'm stuck in the closet and can't get out. need help.
> 
> ethan: lol right.
> 
> foogama: ethan, i'm dead serious. i need you to help create a distraction for ned so that i can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
> 
> ethan: …we're going to need to have a talk later.

right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). it was 10:45pm on a thursday, but i could hear ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **""hello? why yes ned is here. is everything okay? ned! ned come here, phone for you!""** ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. how this never raised suspicion, i'll never know. it was a cordless phone. there was no need for ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. but thank god he did. i bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some ""stranger"" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

i was forever in debt to ethan for saving my ass, and we never told ned. that is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in ned's wedding. there was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we ""found interesting"" about ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, i was convinced by ethan to write ""that he enjoys anal sex with large black women"" because it would make a fun ""bachelor story"" over 10 years after the fact.

but of course that's not what happened. the best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we'd be reading the bride's, and they'd be reading ned's. and of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. i didn't even know her name. i had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

the bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. he immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. i immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. ethan and i waited for ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. we were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

**tl;dr – hid in my roommate's closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride's best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**

i've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

edit: thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for ned. ned is a really great guy and i'm sure we'll be fine.

edit 2: i got ""ethan"" to create a reddit account and entertain questions. you can find his comment here(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7y6bqu/tifu_by_revealing_that_i_had_secretly_hid_in_my/duf2fq4/).

"by losing my right testicle in a ball slapping contest. obligatory ""didn't happen today"" but four years ago when i was 17.

also no need for a throwaway account since pretty much everyone i know have heard the story.

&#x200b;

my friend and i were in the sauna and he gets an idea that we should see which one of us could make our balls clap louder by hip thrusting back and forth and i was like ""yeah haha let's do that!"" so there we were, two straight dudes standing in the sauna hip thrusting away and laughing at the sound our sacks made. my friend won the contest and we sat down. i started to feel a little uncomfortable. like someone was squeezing my right nut. it didn't hurt that much when i was sitting down but once i got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. my vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ° c sauna). i dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. my friend brought me a glass of water and i chugged it down in one go. i told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. he asked me if i preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, i said i'll have both. i chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually i require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. i laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level i told him that i'm going to head home. i had ridden my moped there so i had to ride it home as well. it was winter and the roads were bumpy. each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but i managed to get home. once i got home i walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. usually i stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why i went to sleep so early. she was worried that i had been drinking or taken drugs so i just told her that i almost fainted and want to sleep now. in the morning when i woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so i rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. she examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. when i got home from school i showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. there they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. we waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that i had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. a nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. i changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. i was put to sleep and when i woke up in the recovery ward i immediately sat up. a nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. they tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. i started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). the nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. they were shocked about my condition and asked me how i was feeling ""as a man"" but i told them that i just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest.

tl;dr had a hip thrusting contest with my friend to see who could clap one's balls loudest, ended up losing the contest and my right testicle.",4
"by ruining a vegetarian's love of gummy candy. i like to have some gummy bears at my desk in the morning. because every day is a good day when you start it with gummy bears. i always offer some to anyone who happens to pass through my office. one person in our office is a vegetarian, i am aware of this. they passed by as another person and i were enjoying gummy bears, i quickly began to offer them one and then halfway through my offer i was like ""oh sorry, right! you won't want these!"" 

they responded with ""why wouldn't i?! i love gummy bears!"" i stared awkwardly for a moment before responding with ""well, they have beef gelatin in them."" 

them: ""what do you mean beef gelatin? why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?""

me: ""i thought all gelatin came from animals.""

them: ""are you serious? you aren't serious right? i love gummy bears. my kid and i eat them together all the time."" (kid is vegetarian as well)

me (now panicking): ""i think i am. i don't know. maybe you're right! i'm 
sorry! you're welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.""

they now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. i swear i could see them going through the stages of grief because i know how sad i would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. so by shattering a vegetarian's blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.

tl;dr by informing a vegetarian who loves gummy bears that gelatin comes from animals, thus ruining gummy bears for them (and subsequently their child)

edit: omg. front page. all you guys are awesome! and i'm learning so much! i just want to clarify a couple of items. first, this coworker of mine isn't preachy at all or anything. i just happen to know their choice and respect it, i have no idea if it's for health or ethical or sensory reasons or whatever. second, my understanding is that their child chooses to also follow a vegetarian diet but is encouraged to try anything they want, so no forced vegetarianism on the child (yay!). i'm excited about all the dialogue. and feeling a little drunk on the power of knowledge. but pretty please don't bash my co-worker for their dietary choices because, ultimately, it is their choice :)...and they don't judge me for eating candy for breakfast. thanks reddit world!

edit2: formatting (thank you to the user who showed me the way. hopefully it's a bit better now). also, thank you for the awards!! but! it they are costing you money, please donate said money to a charity near you that feeds hungry people. or buy a vegetarian friend a bag of vegetarian friendly gummy bears!",4
"by hoarding my grandparents' pension and starving them.. my grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. they don't go out much from their house. so i help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to atms etc.  i'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. it usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. i also had somethings to attend to. so, when i was done, i realised that it was late. i came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that i'll return his pension the next day. 

the next few days were so hectic that i completely forgot about his pension. i usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which i keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. i use the latter one more. after 5 days, i was in need of some cash. so i opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

i was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. i was so ashamed that i ran to their house. i knew that they'd be angry so i bought some groceries as a compensation. as soon as my granddad opened the door,  i started apologizing. he kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as i was done. i handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

well my guilt was gone and i was again my normal miserable self. i opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. my guilt came running back to me, i walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. i knew i was the cause of this. 

i asked them about it and they told me how they knew i was busy and thought that i'd turn up when i have the time. they didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. i had never been more ashamed in my life.  my one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

they already had a really hard life. they had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. first their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. and i guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. it's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. i guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

tl;dr: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. they didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread.

edit: this really blew up! thank you random strangers of reddit for all your upvotes.
and a special thanks to /u/grousakes and all the others for your silver and gold. even though i don't know you, i know that you're good people.
and lastly, thank you grandma and grandpa!

edit2: thank you guys for all your amazing suggestions. i'd try to implement them. and your generous offers to help me out. i'm truly greatful! 
i'm amazed that this made it to the front page! 
thanks guys!

edit3: guys check out r/caregiversupport, if you want to help someone. it was suggested in the comments.

edit4: guys i'd like to give you some context. there are so many valuable suggestions but i'd like to mention that i live in india. there are not many services available related to elderly. even the normal food delivery services are scarce.
also i've tried many things but my grandparents are very unlucky. they were doing well until 4 years ago, when my grandpa lost his eyesight due to his diabetes and cataract. he now can only see from one eye having only 1/8th vision and is advised to not to read or write. he used to handle all the finances but now he is unable to do anything.
my grandma is not literate. she dropped out of school in early years and couldn't read or write much. so she can't access any services. she just does the household chores. 
that's why i've been helping them. 
even after all this, they don't let me pay for anything. even a simple thing like electric bill payment is reimbursed to me. it's really unfortunate what happened with them but they don't show it even a bit. they're a proud couple and i really love them a lot.",4
"by not closing the tab of porn on my phone after masturbating.. here we go. this happened yesterday in university. 

so, i wake up at 7 and i have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.

i brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. as i am drying myself i pick up the phone to check time and it's only 7:20 yet and i have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and i haven't had a good release since a week. 

i take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching pornhub. i take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. i am all into it and realise i have only 5 more minutes left. i give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. 

i reach university and the examination hall is already full. here (india) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your exam registration. i take my stuff and enter the classroom. 

the invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. i go to my desk and as i am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. i lose my shit and get all tensed up. 

i try to keep calm and switch it to silent mode and tell myself if i act normally i won't get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. 

soon after the unfair means squad (they check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. i keep my head down and act like i have nothing. 

one of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. i start sweating and i almost shit my pants. she tells me to empty my pockets and i take everything out and put it on the desk.

 she stares at me and picks up my phone. 

""you seem like a studious one. why are you cheating?"" she said. 

""i am not. it's an honest mistake."" 

then she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if i have any pdf or browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she'll let me go. 

my heart finally stops powering a jet and i place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. 

my heart now starts powering a rocket as i recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. the video paused.  there's nothing on the screen though. no image or thumbnail. 

""cheating from a video?"" she says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. 

there it is. dani daniels and manuel ferrara going at it. the sound of dani daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. 

the professor dropped my phone and had a face as if i was masturbating in front of her. 

now i have failed computational mathematics and have to give a written apology to the dean of academics and convenor of examination. 

anyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. had to send the link. 


tl;dr : i forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn't allowed and thr professor caught me. she checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.

edit : 

1. for the people who think this is fake. it is not.   
                                                         
2.  for people who are saying why was i failed and now need to produce an apology one even though i wasn't cheating - it is because in india these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. also, i only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. 

3. the porn was manuel ferrara and dani daniels, they don't have much together. you will easily get it with one search on pornhub. if i may suggest something much more better, please try manuel ferrara and the goddess remy lacroix. the video starts with them talking about cup or something. that also is easily available. 

4. about the girl who asked for the link. 

i was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. 

the girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. as she came outside she asked me why did i bring a phone to the exam and even if i did, i could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. i said i could have but my i couldn't think at that time and was afraid. 

after that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. the girl accompanied me to the admin office. i accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. 

it was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. she asked to show me what was the video while giggling and i thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. she started laughing and told me i am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. she remembered my name and my department. then we parted ways. 

for fuck's sake, she is cute. stop telling me to pursue her. i have another exam later. maybe will meet her there. 


the indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.

edit 2: man i have been reading the comments and you bastards are funny as fuck. i have bee quite depressed since a few weeks and this cheered me up good. 

thanks for whoever sent the silver and gold. i haven't figured out what to do with them anyway.

edit 3: invigilator is an actual word people and we use it all the time. in fact, that is the word for exam proctor here in india borrowed down from the time when we had a case of britishers. 

thanks for the gold and silver again. open some sort of privileged sub-reddits i think.",4
"by finding my girlfriend's tumblr. so i've been seeing seeing this girl for almost 6 months now. she's super terrific to me, and i really think things are going better than they've gone in my most recent relationships. we met on tinder! i personally deleted tinder two weeks after meeting her because i was that into her. she told me she did the same about two weeks after that. however, a recent instagram post notified me that she had a tumblr account. figured i'd look at it, because we had each other on other social media's (and i was curious)

it's a perfect summer night in 2018. i'm leaving a job that i hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. i turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 am,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.

&#x200b;

last call rings out, the bar is mobbed. i lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (mag) who approaches me shortly after. she's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. she's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.

&#x200b;

mag is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the bmi chart, leading me to believe i'm being hit with a bait and switch. they swiftly disprove that theory by literally asking if i ""want both"" of them. worth noting that this is the only time i've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so i jumped at the chance.

my drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. having been recently broken up with, i know exactly where her head is at. having done far too many shots, i am not scared to console this crying stranger. soon i will be the advice champion, and fuck every girl in the house.

* you're so much better than him.
* he *obviously* doesn't deserve you.
* you'll look back and laugh at this in a month.

"while talking dirty to my gf. throwaway for obvious reasons.

so a little background: my current gf and i have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. before her i was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and i'm learning everything for the first time. long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. i said i was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside i knew that i had no idea what i would be doing and would kind of be winging it. last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. so we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. she's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
she kind of rambled for a bit, and i was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. the rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than i normally do. this is all new territory for me, but i'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like christopher columbus, and she's what i think is india. so i decide to talk dirty. her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, i figure this is the perfect time to strike. and that's when i cleverly decided to ask if i make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

her face fell. it's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. i went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. i've been wondering how i could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. we approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. i don't think i'll be redeeming myself anytime soon.

"by making fun of anti-vaxers at my new job in front of my pregnant and (apparently) anti-vaxer manager.. so i just started in this company a few weeks back. i'm your typical shy person that in the first few weeks doesn't say much and really needs some time to get comfortable with the new situation and new people. starting this job it was no different.

now, a few weeks later i'm starting to feel comfortable around everyone and also starting to make jokes and joining non-work related discussions between co-workers. somehow we landed on the topic of old diseases that nowadays barely occur. my manager named a few and i said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.

then i jokingly said, 'and nowadays you don't know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.' ...

my co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. she raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. it was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.

i guess the coming year will be one really interesting one for me.

"by letting my parents have access to my bank account and student loan money.. backstory- my parents wanted me to learn responsibility with money when i was in middle school so they opened a bank account for me with a debit card. they have complete access to it and can take out or add money if they want to. multiple times while in high school i had money saved up in my account and they took huge chunks out because they ""needed it."" i was paid back in increments when they took large amounts of money out but i still don't think they have fully paid me back for all the money they took. 

fast forward to now and i still haven't learned my lesson of keeping my money in a separate account that they don't have access to. i have to take our student loans to pay for school (tuition, rent, utilities, food, etc). i had $4000 in student loan money in my account last month and i get a text from my mom saying she transferred all that money to her account so she could pay my rent in advance for the next couple months. i didn't understand why she did that because i've been paying my monthly rent just fine but i said okay and didn't think twice about it until yesterday. 

my rent is due the first of each month and if my mom would have prepaid my rent, i should not have gotten a notification to pay it. but i did get a notification and i was confused. i logged online to look at my account and it said i needed to make a payment. i thought it was just an error or something so i called the 24 hour hotline and they told me there was no payment ever made. i confronted my mom about this and she said ""oh crap i forgot to pay it! let me go pay it real quick."" i was relieved but only for a little bit. she came back later and told me my dad spent all my loan money on bills and christmas gifts because he thought it was theirs. she told me she is sorry but they don't have the money right now to pay me back because they don't have any extra money leftover after christmas. so now i have come up with enough money to pay my rent and utility bill and am out $4000. i doubt i will ever see anything close to that $4000 again.

tl;dr - parents have access to my bank account and mom took out my $4000 in loan money to pay my rent. dad spent all the money and they can't pay me back. i'm out $4000.  

edit - i have since created a new checking account online at a different bank and will be moving what money i have left into the new account and will be adding my direct deposit to the new account. thank you all for the advice so far and the support!

edit 2 - i am overwhelmed with the number of people who have pm'd me offering advice, kind words, and even offering me money or starting a gofundme. i'm amazed how much people would do for a complete stranger and can't express my gratitude enough. however, i was smart enough with my money last semester and have enough saved up to still pay my rent. i never thought i would need a rainy-day fund so soon haha. but i am okay and it would feel wrong to accept any of your money. you all are an example of how much good is in this world.",4
"by ingesting my bf's chemo. figured it out today, but have been fucking up for 3 weeks. 

bf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. so our sex life has stayed at our normal level. probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. 

i've been having horrible nausea and headaches. i already have anxiety so i figured i'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. 

this morning i woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. i google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. symptoms include nausea and headaches. and the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. 

i've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. 

you're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. now that i know this it seems super obvious. but uh, guess i was too horny to think it through.

tl;dr did dirty deeds with my bf's chemo dick and got sick from it

eta: thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. 

to answer as many questions as i can and also because i feel mildly defensive: he is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. there is no cure but no timeline either. we probably have a few more years. he is in excellent care at a renowned university program. we adore his team. i've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. this was not reviewed with us, only side effects. the separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. we didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. but it is mine. so all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. we're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. or they just forgot. or they figured we'd read the info. shit happens. 

edit 2: please stop hitting on me in my dms, jesus fucking christ ",4
"by letting my boyfriend have a lie in.. obligatory just over a week ago comment. so i have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we've only been together three months. and also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. 

ragebeak belongs to me. it is a saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. still, i thought being a saturday i'd take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.

i fell down the stairs. still holding very small parrot and my first thought was oh god dont crush him so i threw my hands up like i just didn't care and...

i broke my back.

and then when i finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) i passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. 

woke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like the dead and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.

tl;dr removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. right in his face.

edit - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so i'm not paralyzed and there shouldn't be any life-ruining effects. i'm just on bed rest and lots of pain medication!

thanks for the silver! and gold! and the poo! and all your lovely comments/well wishes/ recommendations :)

"by getting titfucked nsfw. so setting the scene, finished my last final, tired as shit. so, what do i do go to a bar. there i am chilling and this guy buys me a drink we chat and we hit it off hes really cool hes from my home town and we just really relate to each other really well.


fast forward and were fucked hardly holding our shit together, being somewhat responsible we leave and call an uber. we went to his apartment and chilled and watched netflix and whatnot until we made a bet on some weird shit. i dont remember what it was on but if he won he would get a titjob and if i won he would get graham crackers and icing from the store and we would make those graham cracker christmas houses, yes it was spring, yes we were wasted.


so the outcome had us in bed with me lying on my back holding my tits together and him on my chest thrusting between my tits. the liquor probably helped a lot but i thought it was hot as fuck. he starts moaning and groaning a whole lot more and i close my eyes and he cums on my face and chest. not a second later i hear a girl screeching. it scares the shot out of me so i scream and open my eyes and instantly get cum in my left eye. the guy starts laughing his ass off, his girlfriend/ wife starts crying while still screaming and i'm still laying down and i cant see shit. she runs out of the house and the guy grabs a pair of pants and runs after her. 


i dont really know what i was supposed to do so i just kind of took a shower and left. their shower was really nice though. it was really tall and open and kind of looked like the top of a lighthouse.


overall
guys looks: 8/10 nice beard

sex: 9.4/10 nice and steamy 

cum in eye: ß gritty?

shower: 10/10 really cool


tl;dr: got drunk, lost a bet, got titfucked, got cum in eye, fucked a relationship but showered in a really cool shower.


edit: so... i was piss drunk when i made this post and simply put i would much rather have not posted this story at all. however as people seem to be deeply intrigued in it i will leave it up. i apologize for the parts of the story that seems to be just rambling as i had quite a bit to drink last night. also, to those that gave me the awards i greatly appreciate it.",4
"tifu by accidentally revealing to my whole family that i masturbate every morning. 
this happened a couple hours ago and they're still laughing


i was visiting my parents house for dinner with my family, and almost everyone in my family *of 7*  got apple watches recently and was talking about fitness tracking and heart rate monitoring *they're all health nuts* and we got to the topic of resting heart rates and sleeping patterns and i was looking at my sleep monitoring and realized that my heart rate aggressively spikes every morning when i wake up so i brought it up with them and everyone was trying to think of what i could possibly be doing in the morning that causes my heart rate spike to an active heart rate so quickly. my sister and mom realized at the same time and started dying laughing until i realized what the first thing i do in the morning...

tl:dr family looked at my heart rate patterns and figured out i masturbate every morning.

edit: to the 300+ comments that told me to say i do morning workout routines. where were you at dinner because i could have used you😂",4
"tifu by having a threesome. my girlfriend and i have been together for several months now. we only see each other on weekends due to distance and work schedules, but this last weekend i fucked up. 

her friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. they were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and i was involved. we went to the bed and started fucking, but before i went inside her friend, i looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, ""is this okay?"" 

she said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. after a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

my girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so i thought. i called her the following night cause i felt extremely guilty. she said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. she simply asked that i never do it again. 

come this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends. i absolutely love her so much but i let lust get between us. 

i really fucked up guys..

tl;dr: i fucked my girlfriend's friend with her and then she broke up with me because she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends.",4
"by ordering food online amd essentially setting restaurant on fire with the help of bee movie script. ok guys, gonna make it short. this happened like a year ago, but i just remembered it and wanned to share  


it was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  
so i got an idea, to ""prank"" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. thats where the fu happened. few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (it wasnt that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). well shortly after, also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction. (ps: was on ground floor, ""wall"" was from glass, so you could easily se on the street)  
the next day i read in local newspapers, that the exact restaurant caught fire because of some cash register malfunction

tl;dr: ordered food online and set restaurant on fire by pasting bee movie script into the order-note box

"by burning 700 lbs of marijuana and getting half of the military high.. while overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. we usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. enough pot for a lifetime. the pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. sometimes taller. it's grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. it's a remarkable sight. 

for those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, i would like to clarify… i never touched the stuff overseas. far too terrifying. they also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there's another reason to steer clear.

anyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. well one day while searching a suspected hme (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. if you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. my mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. a literal fortune. this looked like the hulk fell into a wood chipper. 

a genius counterpart suggested that we bring mt. kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. 

""well that's a clever idea!"" i thought, relieved that we wouldn't have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. 

ah but ambushed, we were. the bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. i ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. 

&#x200b;

the early effects weren't bad. the smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, tower 3. jokes went around as we awaited the results. coughing could be heard immediately and the private in tower 3 called out to us: 

""hey we need to…. we need to… do something… like… now?"" i could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. 

this was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.

""sergeant, i'm… i'm high as shit!"" he yelled moments after. i panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. 

""someone, relieve him!"" (genius)

several individuals raced to take over tower 3. we devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. how perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. like a lazy pot-nado. around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently tower 2. several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. 

""who the hell approved this!!?"" the first sergeant yelled

""i believe you did.."" the co responded 

""well where's the detail that brought it in?"" 

""that would be us first-sergeant"" myself and a couple others. i thought back to the decision-making process and realized that i had a ton of responsibility in the matter. in fact, i was *really worried.* abnormally concerned… i felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking ""ohjesusohjesusohjesus i'm going to get caught...!"" it was in that moment that i realized, i was sketching. i was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. 

i turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. my leaders did not need to see me drool. i hazily walked back toward tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other's laps, goofing off, and having a 'deep philosophical conversation' about a bug's journey through life.

inert.

i wrote tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward tower 2 to see if i could help, a big stupid smile on my face. they seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. i started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. we theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the tower 2 crew.

i assume the wind was completely dead now, as i remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. **here**(https://imgur.com/a/lvzqg8f) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.

at this point i thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. here i was reunited with half my squad. instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and i could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. 

although i was personally quite effected, i think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. a lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. i did not personally see it. i came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where i belonged. i theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. no repercussions followed.

 

tl;dr – tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us.",4
"by accidentally assaulting a child in a public park. so today was pretty f*cking eventful. 

first, obligatory backstory: my best friend and i often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it's a lot of fun when everyone's enjoying themselves and letting loose. one weekend, my best friend's older brother came home from croatia ( first time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. he offers me if i want to come but i want them to have quality bro time so i pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.

it just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (we'll call him l) got into a fight with another group of guys. although he and his bro didn't sustain too much damage from the fight (the other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) l and i got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. it would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.

we caught up and chilled at a local public playground (keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we'd deck the other and how we'd essentially easily f*ck the other up. we began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. 

it was just two 18yr olds messing around. 

all of a sudden, i say something stupid in a mock japanese accent (i'm asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at l, when this child that couldn't be over 8 jumps in and says ""hiiyaahh""

i couldn't stop my momentum and proceeded to yeet this kid into the sandpit... 

no amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.

i went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. he wasn't seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. 

his older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. i apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying i talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.

his bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. all in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and i got to kick a child in the face... win-win.      (that's a joke)

tl:dr
best friend and i were pretend fighting in a public park and when i attempted to do a ridiculous kick i saw on ufc, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. worth it.

edit: holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, i am not worthy of this. i made this post at 12am last night and when i woke up, i was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. 

i appreciate you all!

edit #2: i didn't make one point clear enough regarding the playground. besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. l and i made sure that our presence wasn't making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn't have even entered the playground area at all.

hope that kinda clears some shiz up",4
"by unintentionally betraying the trust of my new kitten. (nsfw)?. obligatory, wasn't today, but 2 days ago.

so my gf and i adopted a new kitten a week ago. she's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or i go. she also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.

well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and i had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as i had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. so i went into the bathroom and began to pee. as i was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all i could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. i looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. i started screaming ""oh fuck!"" and managed to pinch off my stream. the kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as i pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. this all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

it took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. i set her in the tub and i had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. i got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. the last few nights i've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. i dont know what shes planning, but i'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

my girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that i pissed on our new kitten..

tl:dr - i gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... to my new kitten...

"when using the shower head to masturbate. alrighty it's now the morning after;  i am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won't stop laughing at me. 

last night hubby & i had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. 

as usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. one of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know 😉

as a 35 year old woman i had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. sure, i have toys (i'm no prude) but i had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. 

the night ended and we went home. smelling of the bonfire i tell hubby i'm having a shower & he says he doesn't care, he's going to bed. 

i should admit i was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an uber in case anyone's concerned we drove under the influence). 

i'm washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. ok, imma try the shower head... 

ok feels good but need more pressure.. 

ok feels better but i could still use more pressure.. 

ohh ok that's just right. yeah that's the spot... oh yeah that's the spot!!!!! 

...screaming: ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! 

just as i was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. i slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as i managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. 

hubby came running in and i'm telling you it was a fucking sight. 

i'm planked from the shower across the toilet (in like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while i'm crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. 

i fucked up y'all. 

it takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that's ever happened. 

i managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. lucky.

anyway we went to the ed because i did have a few decent cuts but i only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. again, lucky. 

i told the nurse & doctor that i slipped while cleaning the shower. you know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. 

i'll be telling our landlord the same thing today. 

tl;dr went to town on myself with the shower head, as i orgasmed i slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ed for a few stitches.

edit: changed the tldr for u/nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate

edit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. thanks for the awards too. 

to answer the biggest question: i was embarrassed and panicked when i said i was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying i slipped. stupid i know, but none of us are perfect. 

to all the men jealous of the female clit, just remember you can pee anywhere with ease and we can't so you've got that 😂

to the people who criticized my writing style, my overuse of the word hubby, who think i'm a man, who slid into my dms just to slut shame me & tell me off- fucking hell just get over it and scroll on by. i'm not responding to anyone who attacks me, it's pretty sad you've got nothing better to do than bring negativity where it's just not needed. 

i've also learnt that the shower head seems to be the most common way for us females to get off and i've learnt a lot about how to do it safely so thank you!",4
"by wearing the wrong size shoes for my entire adult life.. okay, so by standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony i unintentionally put myself through, i think it qualifies.

i have fairly weird-sized feet.  they're very wide, but not all that long.  i have no arch to speak of.  i'm a fairly short guy, about 5'7"", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  i'm pretty short so i should be wearing a fairly small size, right?

wrong.

when i was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure i had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.

as an adult, i assumed, well, since i'm full-grown, i should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  for me, that's a size 10 (us).

problem was, i kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, i'll switch to size 10w.

still no luck.  still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  my running shoes were so ill-fitted that i actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.

my friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn't need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5w nikes.  i said, ""sure, fuck it, i'll take them, let's see how they fit.""

oh.  my.  god.

it was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  i was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  i had no idea how much misery i had been in until i wore those shoes.  i wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because i was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn't realize it.  there's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.

tl;dr - i'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years i have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because i was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes.",4
"by going blind and posting in r/pics. by going blind and posting in r/pics 

a friendly redditor u/kevindavebob suggested i post on so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). this is certainly a and it all just happened so i'm still feeling pretty terrible about it.

i have a rare disease called usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. one of the ways i cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever i can to create visual memories before i go blind. i went to iceland to try to see the northern lights. i can't even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. i didn't know if it would be too late for me to see them. 

i really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for usher syndrome. only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, i certainly can't capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. i was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. the photo has been linked so many times that i didn't spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going….).

with my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, i posted in r/pics. i chatted with a few kind redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about usher syndrome. then i went to sleep….

well, all hell broke loose.

my post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. i woke up to thousands of hurtful messages and comments – calling me a liar and telling me i don't have my disease, redditors telling me they're happy i'm going blind if it is true, that i should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones i won't write here).

i wish the mods took my post down while i was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite reddit telling me i was a fraud. it then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where i got even more hate. i didn't say it was my picture, but i didn't credit the photographer. i seriously fucked up.

i can't even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. living with usher syndrome is not easy. there is no cure and it's terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. my vision especially. i want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for usher syndrome to discover a cure. not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. 

i was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, i didn't make the effort to credit the photographer the way i should have. i fucked up reddit. 

i am getting so much hate now, even outside of reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. i'm sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. we have too much negativity in this world and it's got to stop at some point. 

thank you to everyone who was understanding and realized i made a mistake. thank you luke stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. i'm sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.

from the bottom of my heart, i am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.

i really did fuck up, though. 


tldr; i tried to raise awareness for usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, luke stackpoole. my post made it to the front page and reddit now hates me.

edit: a nice redditor (u/omichandralekha) suggested i share the non-profit that donates to usher syndrome research so here you go (no need to click on it if you don't want to, it just takes you to the homepage of this non-profit where you can learn more about it all) - the usher syndrome society: www.ushersyndromesociety.org. also, full disclosure: i am on the board of directors and it's a pretty amazing organization!",4
"by escaping an escape room.. a friend-of-a-friend has apparently been into escape rooms for a while now, and finally decided to create his own as a halloween party experience for his friends.

since i don't know him, and wouldn't realistically be coming to the party, i agreed to take part in a test along with three other random folks that had been gathered for the dry run. it ended up being a group of four people who totally didn't know each other at all, as opposed to any sort of cohesive group of friends or employees.

our host told us a ton of rules and guidelines. don't break anything, no answers are hidden on or in something you have to ruin in order to see it, and so on. he was going to stand inside the room with us, but was to be ignored as if he wasn't there. this was in case we needed any direction or if we started doing something against the rules. he wore a black mask and black clothing.

immediately at the start of the game, everyone got quiet and started looking around slowly. as i mentioned, no one knew each other - and it was really awkward. i didn't want to be the ""guy who's super excited to lead the group"", and i guess they didn't either.

the escape room was history-themed. computer-printed photos of historical figures and explorers on the walls, a cheap dollar store style globe on an end table, and so on. lots of books stacked around.

the first thing i did was look at the combination lock on the door, which had four numbered rollers.

i put in the first relevant number i thought of, 1492, the date christopher columbus landed in the americas.

lock opens.

things got a thousand times more awkward.

i apologized and explained the situation to the host, who told me to sit down for the duration, re-locked  the door, and asked the remaining guests to figure out where the combination was hidden. the host was incredibly angry, but only in so much as i could hear it in his voice and see it in how he moved - mainly closing and re-locking the door hard. he didn't call me out for doing an obviously brain-dead thing and didn't say anything rude.

soonafter, i decided it'd be better if i just left, apologizing again.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - put the first thing that came to mind into a combination lock, ruined an escape room.

&#x200b;

**edit:** was told second-hand that he was (is?) mad i tried the lock right away instead of engaging with the puzzles at all. i can see how that can be considered a dick move, personally, but i appreciate everyone assuring me i didn't fu. i agree with you on principle i suppose, but i also can see how going directly for the lock was rude in a certain light. the escape room was ""intended to be easier than normal"" for the guests, the majority of whom haven't done one before. dunno if that's legit or an excuse, of course. thanks for all the positive responses!!",4
"by making everyone in the elevator think that they were going to die.. alright, so this is an old story, but when i found this sub, i had to share.

when i used to be a muslim, i had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

i was on holiday the day of the fuckup. i got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the paris attacks. there were roughly six people in it. then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. for those who don't know, the adhaan starts with allahu akbar. when that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. i had to explain to them that i wasn't a terrorist. then everyone just started laughing.

i understand that everyone may think this isn't a fuckup, but i feel like i shouldn't have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the paris attacks.

tl;dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks i'm about to blow up the elevator.

edit: holy fucking shit, this post has blown up.
thanks to the people who awarded me silvers and gold:)

i need to clear some stuff up first:

when i meant laugh, (ik, that segment was worded horribly) i'm not referring to full out laughter. just some chuckling and light laughing(if that's even a thing)

please stop with all these questions about my religion, let me make this clear, if you message me about my religion, i will not respond. so stop.

and one gripe, a large amount of negative comments,  in most of them the person commenting doesn't seem to understand the full magnitude of the incident and why it provoked that response, please take the effort to fucking understand what i wrote first :)

and to all the haters who are send messages to me calling this story fake, i really don't care if you think my story is real or not. i'm not here to argue  about whether this actually happened.",4
"by going to bed drunk.. so last night i went out as i do every saturday.
when i got there i met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than i could handle. after that i went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as i was trying to lay down on it ""just to rest for a moment"".

i woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. it was cold and i couldn't move it at all.
at first i didn't panic at all because this has happened to me before because i sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. however today i slept with my arm under the side of my body ( i got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. after about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement i woke up my parents and after i explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.

during my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.
however my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. after getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which i hope i never do again) i waited for the results. a little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. 

it appears that i have done damage to a nerve with my hip while i was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (i'm right handed) fingers . at first the doctor didn't know how i managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after i told him what i have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.

now i'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.

tl;dr: drunkenly fell asleep in a bad position and permanently damaged my arm nerves.",4
"by falling deeply in love with my own smell.. this didn't really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. this is a throwaway because i'm very embarrassed. sorry about formatting, i'm typing this on mobile. my girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. it was a horrible event and i still haven't been able to get back into the game since. i was and still am very much in love with her. now to the fuck up.

my favorite possession of all time is her pillow. it smells like her, and i usually sleep with it every night. i haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (i know, gross but i don't think straight anymore). i hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. but this morning when i went for a particularly long morning run i started smelling the smell. really strong. it confused me but i wasn't going to start complaining.

this morning, about 20 minutes ago i arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. and the smell grew more pungent. this was the moment i realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, i got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. i'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell i thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.

tl;dr- slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.

"by being accidentally racist. so this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



recently ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so i thought i'd go along. 

so anyway here i am about to play my first game of chess ever. i sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (i should now mention my opponent was african american). the chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

i think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

so i grab a pawn and slide it forward, then i look up expecting my opponent to make his move. instead i'm met with a look of confusion and horror, i begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

i then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" i murmur. 
the teacher nods. 

now everyone thinks i'm a massive racist.

tl : dr whites go first in chess refers to the pieces and not the people playing",4
"by dating my cousin for 5 months. you hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing 

i was talking to this guy on hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, i thought he was the one. after exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. we dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn't had time to meet each other's parents. instead of doing the traditional, i'll bring you over to meet my parents, and i'll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. you can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend's mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(uncle's daughter). it took her a second to realize as well. since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn't seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and i moved to the same city. we could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn't right to do. that was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. i told my friends that it didn't work out and silently removed everything from social media..

tldr; dated a boy from hinge for about 5 months, and discovered he was my cousin after our parents informed us while out to dinner

"by leaving my ear tubes in for 13 years and not realizing my hearing was going to be different when i took them out. happened this week and i just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and i felt inspired to share my own story.

context: i've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. my childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as i fought them off, and surgery. i've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. my mom and i honestly lost count because there were just too many. my last tube set was put in when i was in 5th grade i believe. i was around 10 or 11. 

i've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. in fact they've helped a few times! i feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. it's awesome. 

so here's where the issues started. 4 months ago i started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. i ignored it because at this point in my life ent doctors give me a lot of anxiety. but the symptoms started getting worse so last month i bit the bullet and went in. i saw the same doctor i had seen and a child. i couldn't believe he was still alive! he told me i developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. i knew this day would come so i agreed.

my surgery was last thursday and immediately post op i realized things were off. my ear popped more times than i could count and i realize i feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. my hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. usually i blast my damn music in my car but now i drive around at 6 volume. and finally my voice has changed. the way i sound to myself it's completely different to what i've come to know over the course of my life. i can't really tell if i'm whispering or shouting just yet because i've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. the kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. i guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! i genuinely did not. 

parents: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood. 

edit: thank you for the gold! thank you so much for the platinum!!! thank you for the silver!!! 

tldr: i've lived my entire life with tubes in my ears and they were effecting my life in more ways than i realized.",4
"by slapping my teachers ass. so basically i was in class with one of my friends who takes the same subject, he was super energetic and always wearing semi-formal clothing.

this is in my relaxed electronics class where everyone moves around and is always chatting away. so, it's mufiday and look over at my friend who was leaning over a desk with his ass sticking out, while he was talking to another student. 

so i go up and with a huge wind up, slap his ass so hard that he immediately jumps up, as if he's just jumped out of his own skin. 

you see, the problem with that was that the person i slapped was not actually my friend... but our teacher. 

everyone is at a stand still, waiting for my death penelty, especially my friend whose just staring my down at this point. now the teacher's face goes bright red, and i'm starting to freak out thinking i'm doomed. 

except, the teacher just sits down, looks me in the eyes and says, ""hewy (not my real name but username will do). save that for after class"" with a big grin on his face.

everyone at this point bursts out laughing as i'm sitting here absolutely shitting my pants thinking i was about to get kicked out of school.

"by giving an alternative meaning to a (previously) suicidal girl's tattoo.. disclaimer: this actually happened several years ago, but i do still feel really bad.

i was out on a date with a girl and things were going well despite me being a nervous wreck. we got to talking and she admitted she had depression and at one point was even suicidal, but was proud of herself for getting past that chapter of her life. she then shows me her semi-colon tattoo on her wrist and explains the significance - that it means the sentence could have ended there, but the author decided to add more. it's all very sweet and heartfelt. now, i in no way have any issues with mental illness and still feel super guilty about this to this day, but me with a perpetual foot-in-the-mouth syndrome say ""you know in programming it means end"".

she doesn't say anything.

i don't say anything.

"by not openning a gift for 1.5 years. this actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. i was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. we got on well and i was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country i decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. i thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so i kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.

in the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. it was all a blur but i kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what i think. well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided not to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). we met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but i was prepared and considered that was it.

the box stayed in my fridge for i dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? she went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and i also met somebody else. one day i was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously i still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then i saw a full page note from her. she basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.

i just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. i probably looked like an asshole for how i acted when i last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am i..

"by changing a client's desktop background to sexy pikachu. this just happened 2 hours ago.


i work for an it company that services many small/medium businesses. i'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. we like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


i had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his pc unlocked. i sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. i quickly pulled up ie and googled ""sexy pikachu"". found the one(http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. then i went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. standard stuff.


i quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. he notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. then he says, ""hey, i'm remoted into a client's computer. you changed their background, not mine.""


i shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""hey, i have jane doe on the phone. she says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" jane doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. i also believe she's the owner's daughter. at first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. he's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


i stand there for a good 30 seconds before i say ""ok, send her over to me."" i'm a director and i have a working relationship with jane doe, so it's really best i talk to her.


i answer the phone. i listen to what she has to say. she had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. she attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new pc and she wants to know what's going on. i tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. i apologize for it, i tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. i hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  i've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""hey, i'm locking my computer for you"" or ""hey, i'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""

"by jerking off and forgetting my petcam was faced directly at me. so i want to just say this is 100% true and 100% embarrassing. 


so i usually have monday's off and spend the day doing homework, tidying up, playing video games, and today... jerking off. i don't usually feel inclined to do this however today i had the urge. it was about an hour before my girlfriend got home so i definitely had time. i go into my room and get into bed and start skimming thru ol' faithful aka pornhub. 

i finally find a video worth b'ing my l to and get down to business. as i'm about to... ya know... i get an alert on my phone that my girlfriend had just accessed the petcam we have in our room that's on our dresser. (we got this petcube camera for christmas so we can watch our two dogs while we are at work/school/out.) i immediately stop, now knowing that my girlfriend just witnessed me jerking it mid-monday so i text her ""........"" . she doesn't answer for about 2 minutes and then i see that she's calling me. 

now we've been together 2.5 years so this isn't like a make or break thing and i honestly thought that although it was slightly embarrassing, it was also pretty funny. so i answer the phone laughing, ready for this to be something we joke about for a long time to come. unfortunately, i was sadly mistaken to this being ""funny"". she tells me that her co-workers had asked about our dogs and she wanted to show them on our awesome petcam! but instead of two cute dogs on our bed, it was just me with my shorts down at my ankles, going to town on myself! so needless to say i don't think i'll be invited to any of her work christmas parties in the future.

tl;dr : decided to crank it before my girlfriend got home and forgot my petcam was faced directly at me. she wanted to show her co-workers our dogs and instead showed them me jerking it in our bed.

edit: lmao just some clarification... she's shown coworkers before because they love our dogs and ask to see them because it's ""cute"" to see them live and sleeping. also, in her defense, i told her i was doing homework and what not so the last thing to cross her mind was me yankin it probably. also the cam is tucked in the corner so i forget it's even there most the time. (b'ing my l = blowing my load)

edit 2 (last one) : for everyone saying ""why would you have a petcam facing your bed?"" that's where our dogs are 90% of the time. when we are out of the house, that's where we leave them. when we are home, that's mostly where they want to be unless we're on the couch with them. don't you think we put the camera there..... for a reason? lol and btw, my gf and i are fine! she was freaked out about it at first but now it's already funny. that's why i love her so much lol so take it easy on her, we both fucked up!

"by walking in on my teenaged son masterbating.. this just happened and i am still wishing it didn't.   my  15 year old son and i are home, i'm working on a puzzle and making dinner, he is playing fortnite.   he disappears for a little while and i go to find him.    i didn't really need him for anything, just wanted to say 'hi' since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.

i start walking down the hallway towards his room—our house isn't super big and i knew he was in there.   the lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but i could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.

i decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   he was lying with his back to me, i could tell by where his phone was.   as i am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, i see it.   my son's boner.   as i was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   it all happened so fast and i was already airborne before i realized what was happening.   i did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son's boner through his boxer briefs.   

the entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, i'm sure.   i have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, and i don't want to.

at that point, i am still flopped down on his bed.   both of us are well aware that i just saw him whacking off.    both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   i say, 'dinner is almost ready.'   (it wasn't)
he said, 'ok, i'll be out in a minute.'
i said, 'no hurry.'

now i'm standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he'll need if he ever finds out i posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering why don't boys close the door when they are masturbating?  

tl/dr:   basically the title.     

edit: spelling.   dammit, i can't change the spelling of 'masturbating' in the title.   oh well.   i fixed 'fortnite' though.   

edit 2:  for those asking:

—i am mom.
—i want to be clear, i have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   i am a nurse.   i talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   the horrifying part is that i walked in on him.   that was not ideal.  for either one of us.  
—his door was open.  
—i have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before i walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   
—he isn't on any social media.   i am quite confident that his identity is protected.

edit 3:   for anyone still interested...

thank you (almost) everyone for taking this as it was:  an embarrassing moment which has most definitely taught both my son and i lessons about boundaries and privacy.    

wow.   i now know what 'rip my inbox' feels like.   i had no idea reddit would be so into my awkward moment.

for those who sent creepy shit to my inbox, just no.

"by telling my best friend i love her when i thought i was going to die. throwaway because i don't want this to be on my main account:


obbligatory ""this didn't happen today but happened last week yadda yadda yadda""

also please forgive my spelling mistakes because i'm in the hospital and writing this on mobile out of boredom of there being not much to do here.

so, last week i was driving casually on the country road close to my house on holiday back home for the summer after my second year of college. i wasn't paying too much attention (i assume some responsibility) and wasn't wearing a seat belt. yes i'm an idiot i know lesson learned. wear your seat belts kids! anyway, it was just starting to rain and i saw a kid about to go into the road. for the life of me i still don't know why he thought it would he a good idea to go onto a quite highly trafficked country road so casually, but eh life is full of surprises. i was caught completely off guard and swerved into the opposing lane to avoid him, and promptly got hit head on by the car coming towards me.

now, i was going quite fast and as i said, did not have a seat belt on. next thing i knew i was out of my car and couldn't feel anything anymore. no pain, no panic, nothing. i just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush i've ever had in my life. i just laid there, not knowing what to do. i heard voices come towards me but didn't really know what they were saying, and couldn't really respond. i thought i was going to die. there was a lot of blood.

you know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die? well that didn't quite happen but i did start thinking about who i care about and who i love. here's where i tell you about my best friend. a girl i've been in love with for around two years, i never let her know and never intended too. she is in a happy relationship she's had since her teens and i didn't want to ruin it, and if she's happy i'm happy. there's no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren't meant to be. but i thought i was literally dying, and all i could think about was her in those moments. the pain was starting to kick in but i was just thinking about how she'd never know how much i loved her.

i realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force i could muster i took it out. it was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message i could sent was an ""i love you"" to her. i thought that would be the last message i'd ever send.

i don't remember much after that. days have been a blur. i've had quite a few operations, aki due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. but my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like i got in a fight with a lion but it's slowly improving! all i do is sleep and appreciate the fact i'm alive. the other driver and the kid were okay btw.
anyway, as you can see, i did indeed live and didn't die (so far), but i can't undo that message i sent. i've been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven't had the energy to confront the situation. i told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. i haven't replied yet and i don't want to. i don't know what to do. so far i've been writing this as procrastination and then after this i plan on taking a long nap. thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.



tldr: got in a car accident and while i was bleeding out i told my crush best friend i love her. she's in a 10 year relationship and i haven't talked to her about it since and it's destroying me.



edit: god guys this blew up so much!!! i only wrote this to procrastinate the inevitable conversation you guys are amazing jeez thanks for all the advice and support!!

so i spoke to her... over the phone because we're college friends and she lives far away right now. i decided that the best thing i could do at this point was just tell her the truth. i didn't expect anything and i didn't want anything to come out of it, but i just thought that to have a pure and true friendship everything needs to be out there or it just wouldn't be legitimate. i would love to tell you guys an amazing fairytail story that would give you guys all hope for the future and whatnot, but i guess life is just different from movies...

i told her how i felt in pretty much the same words as in this post. but i also added, and it's true, that i've gotten to know her boyfriend for the past few years and he's great. i don't want to hurt him or interfere as much as i want her happy. i think she understood where i came from and the circumstances in which those words were said. i hope nothing will change with her because i love spending time with her and neither of us can immagine life without eachother anymore, we both admitted that. so i guess i just have to give you the boring response... but it's reality so sorry if it sucks... im okay with though, i really didn't expect anything and still kind of think i was being selfish. we talked about a lot of other things like we normally do for a couple of hours after that and she might be coming to visit me in the hospital this weekend! she said she'll try and make the trip, even though i told her not to because it's gonna be extremely expensive for her last minute... she was really flattered though i think and almost cried thinking she was the last thing i thought about when i thought i was going to die",4
"by letting my cat put his head in my mouth.. throwaway account for obvious reasons. this just happened a few minutes ago. i was laying on my couch and my cat decided to jump up and lay on my chest as he often does. i had just eaten lunch, which was a chicken salad sandwich, so naturally my cat was intrigued by the smell and wanted to get a good whiff. he was sniffing around my face heavily, almost comically. i was feeling pretty generous at that time so i got the brilliant idea to open my mouth really wide to let him enjoy, but also because i was curious how far he would venture in. you know, normal pet owner stuff. he got his head about halfway in when suddenly he decided to let out a violent and very wet sneeze right into my mouth. i'm fucking disgusted, and the weekend has been ruined before it even started. 

tl;dr: my cat sneezed directly in my mouth.",4
"by plagiarizing from my own reddit post and getting threatened to be dropped from my university. ***background***

i am a very passionate writer. i *had* an account that was just for writing prompts. every week i would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  

***story time***

last year, on r/writingprompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. i forget the full details, but it intrigued me and i wrote a 6-page story about it. anyways, that post didn't gain any traction (which sucked), but i still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that reddit post.

**^((it was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**

***present*** 

so a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. so i was like, okay sweet i don't need to spend any time on this project. i went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. to be sure i don't get into any trouble, i delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn't delete all my comments. 

yesterday, i get an email from the professor saying i need to meet with the dean immediately. at this point, i am shitting my pants. she told me that i stole someone else's work and i could be withdrawn from my program. i try to explain but i have no proof that it was my work because i no longer live at home and i wrote it on an old laptop. i have a meeting with the head of the university later today. i am so fucking scared. i am currently driving home to find that fucker.  

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i copied and pasted my own work from my own reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. could be withdrawn from my program


edit 1: 17:00 i found my original work. took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. i'm okay with taking a zero, obviously, i just hope they can reason. 

also, i can't show the reddit emails because i never had a real email for the account. 

edit 2: success! i brought my old laptop to the university principal and provided proof that i was the one to write the story. they were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what i told them before. they asked me why i did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. i told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. 

*results*

i am not kicked out, and i am actually given another chance at the project. my professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. 


thanks everyone who supported me through this! i won't do this again. i'm sorry. 


also, thanks u/squid_fucker for the suggestion

> just read all the edits.  you know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  if the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.


maybe this will be the plot of the new story. ",4
"by saying the worst possible thing in a restaurant. this happened a few hours ago in a busy buffet restaurant in a hotel in austria.

being a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly austrian and german people passing our table. we've been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.

i was joking with the kids  that i'd left their nintendo switch at home, they suspected i was joking but went along with it anyway. so when i told them i had brought it they wanted to check.

""i brought it,"" i said 

""our switch?""

""yes, our switch""

""what?!! our switch?!""

""yes!! our switch!!""

they got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. i noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn't really register.

""our switch?""

""our switch! ha!""

then my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - i was like ""it's ok... it's a buffet""

""our switch! ha!""

""our switch!""

then my wife leaned in and urgently whispered ""it sounds like you are all shouting auschwitz""

my whole body went cold with the realisation.

needless to say i immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son's knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before i could stop him... 

i have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. 

tldr: shouted ""auschwitz"" loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of germans and austrians. i'm really sorry.

edit: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! my first. to those calling bs: i wish it was. to the genial germans and austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - i will sleep better tonight because of you. and for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it's a kinderhotel. kind of like if michael bay did buffets.

edit2: just to all my salty comrades telling me i'm a ""scum cunt"", that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud. i fucking love you reddit! i'm reassured that you are all so considerate when it comes to noise in public spaces. you wouldn't like this restaurant ... stone walls, stone floors, a hotel designed for kids. it's like a school playground where they've all been given metal objects to smash together but louder. our risky exchange was lost in the cacophony to anyone who wasn't walking past our table..",4
"by teaching my 4 year old about static electricity. so it was rather cold today and i put some nice, thick wool socks on my 4 year old son.  after running around a bit today, he came and gave me a hug.... zaaap.  

i explained to him that he's got to pick up his feet because dragging them on the carpet will build up a ""shock"".  my son looks at me and says ""like pikachu?""

a bit of background.  a few months ago i discovered that disney now has the full run of all pokemon episodes.  like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  my son and i have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  my wife and i decided to get a switch as a family gift for christmas, along with let's go pikachu.  for my son's birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  

so a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his pikachu plushie.  drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing frostpunk and says ""donder shok!!"" while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  

as he runs away, clutching his plushie, all i can say to my wife was ""i think pikachu's been teaching him some tricks"".  she was not amused.  



tl;dr - pikachu taught my son thunder shock.  my wife is not happy about this development.  


edit:  my first gold!  thank you kind stranger!

edit 2:  i know this may be more cute than traditionally tifu, but i'm rather singed at the moment and the wife wasn't too pleased at the time.   i know she'll be laughing about it in a day or two with the rest of us (i hope).

"by almost murdering my friend and stopping a school-wide arms race.. so this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. and just before sillybands took over as chief tween pimp currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed ""locker artillery"". basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. we would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and paper hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.

eventually, things got out of hand. it became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. heists were performed on teacher's desks. books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. students presented welts from paper hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. rubber bands were contraband. it was a full-on mad max magic school bus adventure.

here's where the fuckup started. one night, i was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: the secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. i needed something aerodynamic. so, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. ""i'll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?"" i thought to myself.

let me tell you.

the next day, i created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. with the inkwell loaded, i felt like a small, sexually frustrated macgyver with intent to kill. on the bus, my friend (let's call him neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. i obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). i aimed, pulled back and fired. all i saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before i heard an extremely sudden *crack*. i looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from neo's head.

my parents had to pay for the window. neo's parents didn't let me over to his house until senior year. the principal cracked down on locker artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. 

but i still won that arms race.

tl;dr: sixth grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. i upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. i was suspended and my friend's parents don't like me anymore.

edit: rip inbox. thank you for the gold, kind stranger!

"by catcalling my husband.. edited to add: holy crap, this post blew up more than i expected! thank you to the anonymous redditors that gave me my first silver and platinum, you are so awesome!

naturally, this did not happen today...
tl;dr is at the bottom.

about a week ago, i was running errands with my 1 and 3 year old boys. we had some time to kill, and my 3 year old said that he wanted to see his daddy. so we picked up lunch and took it to my husband's work so that he could have a hot lunch instead of leftovers from the night before.

we got the boys out of their carseats, let them sit in our laps as we all ate chicken tenders and fries in the front seat. then, my husband took us for a tour around his shop (he works in sheet metal and makes air ducts). our kids loved it!

as we were leaving, i saw my husband walking into the building and honked at him, calling out ""hey, nice butt babe!""

then it happened, my 3 year old yelled ""nice butt daddy!"" which quickly turned into ""nice butt mama.""

i tried my best to ignore it even though he kept repeating it. i thought that the worst was over when he eventually forgot about it.

i was wrong.

now, almost a week later, he is yelling out our living room window;

""nice butt papa"" (what he calls our elderly neighbor)

""nice butt mama""

""nice butt baby"" (his little brother)

i don't think we will be leaving the house today...

tl;dr i set a bad example for my child and now he is telling everyone that they have a nice butt.",4
"tifu by accidentally proposing to my gf of 2 months. so this just happened. back story i had a gf of 6 years i was going to propose to, and as not necessarily superstitious i will not ""recycle"" an engagment ring even tho it cost what it did. i thought it was stolen or lost. it had been missing for close to 3 years. 

so what happened. in the proccess of rearranging my kitchen i decided to consolidate a few boxes of the same product (lipton tea) i had several boxes and was going to put them all into one. simple enough i thought. 

now with my new girl friend standing to my right i open the first box and holly mother of fucking pearl it cant be, but it is the ring box. this is where my thinking was holly shit i just found that ring, no way... hey babe check this out just found that ring i lost. not really thinking a lot about it i open the box and turn to her. 

seemed pretty simple i found a lost ring, hey look what i found.

and thats when she made a really awkward face started shaking and runs out of the room basicly saying no fucking way oh my god no fucking way. at this point im like wtf was that about. when i walk around the corner to check whats wrong shes almost crying saying really too soon, not yet at least.

light bulb she thought i was proposing to her ( in what may be one of the strangest ways possible) but never the less she saw a ring being held out to her and freaked the fuck out. 

hour latter trying to explain i wasent and it was a lost ring i had literally just found she and i are laughing our asses off.

good to know it wasent a flat out no!


tl;dr found a lost ring had bad timing gf thought i was propossing heart fell to floor hilarity insued.

"by unintentionally giving my friend a masturbation alert. so after five months of doing this shit i realized today that this has been happening.

before this happened i was unaware incognito mode on chrome was a thing. because of this every time i would go to a certain nsfw website i would type the link into a discord (basically the new skype) direct message to my friend that lives across the country. i only send the links to him while it said he is offline. i did this so my chrome wouldn't save the keystrokes of whatever website i decided to visit that day and show up in the predictive search. i would then click on the link of the website through discord and delete the message. little did i know that my friend has discord notifications that show up on his phone for whenever he receives a message. he basically had an alert for every time i masturbated.

so after i had been doing this for a while he finally decides to ask me why he receives all of these nsfw links in the middle of the day. i start laughing out of embarrassment because of these notifications he's been receiving. i told him about the whole process i go through just to get to a website. after that he proceeds to laugh for a good few minutes and tell me about incognito mode on chrome as my embarrassment keeps rising. after more laughing we moved on.  

i'm glad to know about incognito mode though i will probably keep doing it has i have been because i'm used to it and it's a great inside joke.   


tl;dr: i have been sending nsfw links to my friend on discord for the past five months while he isn't online to avoid predictive search. he has discord notifications enabled on his phone therefore giving him an alert every time i masturbate .",4
"by holding my breath and passing out during a lecture.. this happened earlier today. so i was in class listening to a lecture and it dawned on me that i couldn't care less about what my professor was talking about. so i decided to start holding my breath. now, this is something i normally do if i get really bored. i'll hold my breath for as long as i can and then i'll rest for 3 minutes. i'll do 5 sets of that. i also make sure to pinch my nose as to avoid cheating. i've actually gotten pretty good at it and can hold my breath for 2 minutes and 15 seconds now. anyways, i start holding my breath and i'm feeling particularly good and i start thinking i can break my record today. i got to about 2 minutes and 20 seconds on my first attempt and then i decide to drop out. ""i can do better, let's go for 2 minutes and 50 seconds"". so i go and i'm feeling super confident about it. i get to 2 minutes 20 sec and i'm feeling a little light headed. get to 2 min and 30 seconds and i'm struggling. like i'm thrashing around silently in my chair, but i'm going for gold. get to 2 minutes 40 and i'm seriously hurting. things are getting bad. i close my eyes to avoid looking at my watch (it also made the seconds go faster) all of a sudden i open my eyes and i'm looking up at the ceiling and everyone is flipping out. as i learned from the girl sitting next to me, it turns out my maximum effort resulted into me passing out, smashing my head on my desk, and falling out of my chair. i spent the next 10 minutes trying to explain to everyone that i was fine. lecture finally resumed and i just sat there feeling like a dumbass with a gnarly headache. lecture still sucked after that. 

tl;dr tried going for olympic gold in breath holding. failed and ended up spread eagle in our lecture hall.

"by becoming an accidental active school shooter. this happened in the oughties. tl/dr below.

my (relatively small) hs held an unexpected live active shooter drill.  it was the first time they had ever done this. i don't know who developed this genius procedure. it actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.

we had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. the teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... the trauma would help us react better? no idea. in fact, i remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.

however, it so happened that i was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. my teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. now i understand why. (his mistake, but i played my part soon after)

on my way to the office (i was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. i was truly in a wtf state.

here's where i f-up. now i am the only dummy walking the hallways. given the layout of this building, when i tell you it was dark, i mean ""you could hardly see your own hand"" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. and it was completely silent now. it all happened in a matter of seconds. i can't say i was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. still, given my aversion to our principal since i was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, i just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. i assumed my teacher knew what was happening and i didn't want to be in more trouble so i just yelled

**""hey let me in!!""**

the entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. this coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as i recall.  (again, this was not a well thought-out plan).

now of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and i'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice i had heard in my life said

**""get on the ground!!!""**

there was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! so whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought i somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, i don't know. he did not have his gun drawn, just his flashlight. he grabbed me up and took me to the office.

the rest was a huge blur but essentially i was not punished for that, but i got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. there was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.

&#x200b;

tl/dr: became unaccounted for just as an active school shooter drill was initiated, ran around and scared the life out of roughly 50 people.

"by ruining a happy family.. like all good tifus, this didn't happen yesterday.

my wife and i went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  it's just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.

one of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  from our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  i assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.

on this particular evening, my wife and i were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  i thought it would be fun to pull up youtube and make duck noises.  i found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so i started playing it.  lo and behold, the ducks responded.  at first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  they ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  it was a pretty fun experience.  that is, until it got out of hand.

apparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  this other drake had no interest in me, however.  he immediately went for the hen.  this led to a fight between the two drakes.  they started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.

my wife and i stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  she still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and i suppose that's fair.

i'm not really super torn up about it.  in fact, i find the whole situation kind of amusing.  i thought this more light-hearted belonged here.

tl;dr:  went to dinner and played duck calls.  called in another drake and ruined a family.

"by quoting thanos while arguing with my gf. trowaway account for privacy, this happened yesterday and i don't know how to make it up.

my girlfriend and i met at university 4 years ago, and we both graduated some time ago. since then we've both been looking for work, but the research is more difficult than we thought, and until yesterday neither of us had managed to get a job. yesterday my girlfriend received a positive answer to one of her applications, for a job located 430 kilometers from our hometown. she was very happy and that's how she told me to come to her house to tell me some good news about the research. so expecting some good news, i took a detour to buy her sushi because we both love it, and i arrived at her house early in the evening, and that's when she tells me that in two weeks she's going to go more than 400 kilometers from our city, and that i now have to look in the same area as her. i totally lost my mind when she told me that. i explain that i understand that the research is complicated, but that it was no reason to look at work across the country, and that i had no desire to leave my family and friends because my life is in my hometown. the situation then became very tense, she told me that i am selfish and that i have to learn to move away, that even if there is no urgency, it is important to find a job quickly so as not to remain inactive. i then offered her a long-distance relationship for a few months because i really don't want to leave, and she could come back as soon as she found a job in our city. and that, guys, she took it really hard, i've never seen her so upset in my life. she then gave me an ultimatum: either i follow her or we stop our relationship, and she asks me if i'm really ready to leave her to stay with my family and friends. maybe some people can see it, but this is the moment i fucked up.

i still don't know why my brain betrayed me like that, but the only answer i could find was : ""perhaps, maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation"". i could have made long rants to show her that i love her, that i care about her. i could have found arguments so that we could solve the situation, as any person in a relationship for 4 years would do. but no, my fucking stupidity made me quote a purple guy. she looked at me with an empty look for several seconds, i realized how much i fucked up, but nothing came from my mouth. she just asks me to leave her house, and since yesterday she speak to me or answer my calls and messages. i sent her a very long message of apology, adding that i hope we will be able to resolve the situation, but still no answer.

i am now staring my thanos funko pop thinking how much this guy may have ruined part of my life.

&#x200b;

edit : whoah, this blew up far more than i could imagine. i took time to read all your comments, and i spend a big part of my day speaking with my gf about the situation. so here's the situation : 1) she's mad that in such a situation my only answer was quoting a meme, 2) she thinks (and she's not the only one from what i read) that i'm still a child for wanting to stay in my city.

to clarify some things i'm living in a small country in europe, that's why 400km is basically across the country. then i admit it, i may not be ready to start my professional life. in my head i'm still a student who always wants to enjoy his life like it was : going out with friends, enjoying parties in the middle of the week, watching sports and taking care of my gf. for me, the best to start my work life was to find a job in my city to keep my bearings and my way of life and to be able to gradually switch to something more serious. that's a big part of why a freaked out when she told me to come far away from everything that defines my life. also yes, there was a big lack of communication in my relationship, she's the first to admit it and apologizes for it.

today we had a more serious discussion (no meme quotes guys !) where both of us expressed their point of view. for my gf, this work is not her dream work, but she wants to take it because we can't find nothing here and she just wants to take it in order to gain experience, and then quit it to a better opportunity. she told me that it would only be a matters of months. i explained my feelings and what i wanted to start my life, and to my surprise she understood. we even reached an agreement : i will looking for a job in my city and in the city where she will work, and i will take the first opportunity. she also needs me to be with here the first month to help her settle in and not to stress about her new situation.  now that we've explained and reached a compromise, she's much calmer and ready to go on, so it seems my stupidity and the purple guy may have not ruined something.

oh, i saw some people were wondering : when i left her house yesterday, i didn't take back the sushi

&#x200b;

tldr : gf finds a job far away from our city and i doesn't want to leave my life to live this far. she asks me if i'm really ready to leave her just to stay in my city and my only answer was ""maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation"".",4
"by knocking out the guy i'm seeing. this actually happened yesterday but i couldn't get a chance to post it.  

i'm a pretty ""basic"" white girl. i'm 21, i like starbucks, i wear leather leggings and hoodies, i'm blonde, i have a part time job as a secretary-- so it was not surprising that the guy i'm sorta dating didn't believe me when i told him i've been kickboxing for the better part of a decade. instead of going to the gym and jogging, kickboxing has been a way for me to be active and stay fit. it kinda pissed me off he thought i'm making it up to look cool in front of him because he's been trying to get into kickboxing-- so i figured, why not have like a fun date at the gym he's been going and kick the heavy bags and have fun.  

he kinda laughed at the idea but i made him accept.  

we got to the gym, i met his gym friends, his coach and so far it was going good. the dumbass jokingly said we should spar and that he'd go easy on me-- told me with sparring gear it wouldn't hurt and it'd be fun. there was no way i'm saying no to that. my plan was show him that experience matters and make him believe me that i've really been doing this for a looooooong time-- but no, the asshole didn't put on any protective gear. i got mad.  

we begin. he's laughing, his friends are laughing and cheering for me like i'm some kid-- and i'm just getting more and more pissed off by the minute. the cheering was the boiling point. as soon as my date got close enough, out of nowhere i decided to head kick him with everything i had. i literally grunted as i kicked him. in the ten or so years i've been kickboxing i don't think i've ever kicked anyone that hard. he was out cold before he even hit the ground. 

needless to say, when he came to his senses he had no choice but to accept that i've actually been kickboxing for quite some time-- i also invited him over at my place tonight and plan to make him dinner to apologize for the ko.  

surprisingly, he doesn't hate me and laughed it off-- and accepted the dinner invite which is a win in my book. 

tl;dr: my date didn't believe me i've been kickboxing for quite a long time and asked me to spar. i head kicked him and knocked him out cold.

"by showing my grandmom that she had been living a lie for almost 30 years.. this did happen today. my grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. she doesn't eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. one of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. she says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. so she keeps changing the position of my bed when i am away for work. when i come back, i reposition it my way so that i don't get sunlight on my face early morning. 
today, she was repositioning the room while i was there which annoyed me. so i took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that i was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. infact i was pointing east . i instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. and she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. i pointed it out to her. i thought she would take it lightly. oh man i was wrong. i fucked up biig time. she lost herself. she started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. i am looking at her old compass right now and i can say it doesn't seem right at all. i think i will have to fix this issue today itself. she is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn't great. how stupid am i. 

tl;dr : i fucked up by showing my grandmother that she was sleeping with her bed pointing north which she is strictly against cause of her superstitious beliefs. she did not take it well . 

edit 1: a lot of you are asking me how she moves furniture at the age of 90. well she doesnt do it herself, she has a helper who is supposed to take care of her personally but my grandmother doesn't like the idea of employing someone particularly for her so she gives her household chores to keep her busy.
edit 2: yes the caregiver gets paid extra for this. we tell her not to do the chores  and i assure you it's not that regular. ",4
"by accidentally doing my black history month project on a white guy. in 5th grade, i had a black history month project where i had to make a presentation on a person of my choice. i looked up 'important african americans' and found a wikipedia page with a list of famous black people, or so i thought. i chose allan mcleod cormack, a south-african american scientist, seeing that he invented the ct scan. i put my blood sweat and tears into that project. two days before the project was due i decided to put a picture of cormack on my poster. to my confusion, all i could find was a picture of this white guy. turns out, he was a white south african. i made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. she let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but i had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month. 

tl;dr i did my black history project on a white guy and didn't realize until the day before it was due, resulting in me having to redo my work.

edit: though cormack was born in south africa, he became a us citizen early in his career. that's why he was on the list of african americans.",4
"by not realizing cheese isn't supposed to hurt you. i guess this is three decades in the making but i only discovered it saturday, so it feels like a very fresh fu.

this weekend i was eating a sandwich with some extra sharp parmigiano-reggiano cheese flakes on it and i made the comment over voice chat with my friends that it was so good but so sharp it was tearing up my mouth. i had a momentary pause before a chorus of puzzled friends chimed in at the same time to ask me to elaborate.

""you know, it's extra sharp. it really cuts and burns my gums and the roof of my mouth.""

and that's when my friends informed me that none of them have this reaction, and futhermore, *no one* has this reaction. i hear several keyboards going at once with people having alt-tabbed to google around and our best webmd-style guess is that i have an allergic reaction to some histamines common in sharp cheeses, and that i've had this reaction for *thirty years*, and that i always assumed *everyone* had it. 

""what the hell do you mean when you call it a *sharp* cheese if that's not what you're talking about?!""

i figured the mild-sharp spectrum for cheeses was like the mild-hot spectrum for spicy foods. i love spicy foods. i love sharp cheeses. i thought they were the same kind of thing where they were supposed to hurt you a little bit. apparently ""sharp"" just means ""flavorful"" or ""tangy.""

tl;dr: i have an allergy to some cheese protein and for 30 years i've been thinking that sharp cheese is supposed to sting.",4
"by breathing with one nostril my whole life.. so let me give some context on how this happened, a while ago i tried out an e-cig my friend has and he made fun of how smoke only goes out of one of my nostrils,i didn't think much of it , i thought its just a stuffed nose.

so i try to clean my nose and its already not stuffed but yet again i didn't put much thought into it.
yesterday i noticed that my right nostril is blocked again and my nose isn't stuffed, so i go look in the mirror to see that my right nostril is completely blocked by my septum.

i took a doctor appointment the next morning and as soon as he looked in he said i have septum deviation caused by breaking my nose at some point in my life when i was a kid and that it needed surgery.
i cant believe i've went for god knows how many years without realizing i wasn't breathing correctly and thinking that this was the norm.
surgery is within 24hours so yeah, this escalated quickly.

tl;dr. i'm stupid and didn't realize my right nostril was blocked off by my septum for years.",4
"by fucking my dads couch. throwaway, because i don't want to become a notorious couch fucker on reddit.

this happened last week on saturday, because saturday and sunday is my father's custody time for me. saturday is also my dad's day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got ""called into work"" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.

this made me think about all the possible (private) things i could do to anything around the house. then i saw; **the $700 leather couch**. i executed my plan. 
materials needed: dish soap, a couch, and rags

i started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. then, i put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. then, the couch bestiality commenced. lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin i am, and there was no turning back. 

another detail about my dad getting called into work is that i was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. on a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. 

not today

he left at 9:30 am for work, and i was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which i felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn't supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. then it **happened**. the couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight

here(https://imgur.com/wi2nz1q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.

i heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. the knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. he gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words ""what the fuck are you doing"". i couldn't decide what to do, so i just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags i stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly ""sorry^sorry^sorry"". he walked back out but before he shut the door, he said ""don't clean that; im throwing it away, now."". the rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.

tl;dr: fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected 

edit: typo

edit no.2: holy shit yall blew this up.
i really, really, really appreciate the gold; regardless if this is a throwaway or not. my couch fucking earned me a dollar and i'm proud!",4
"by accidentally asking a married woman for nudes. obligatory ""this happened a couple weeks ago""

so me (21m) and my best friend (22m) have been best friends since high school. we're from the same town, and went to high school together, but ended up going to different colleges. anyways, i'm super close with his entire family to the point of when summers come around, i end up spending entire days over at his house, sometimes when no one's there. his family counts me as part of their own family.

so his sister (24f) posted a story on instagram about her texting her boyfriend (23m) asking for help with a word puzzle. it was one of those ""even when i'm sick and can't hang out, i still need help with word puzzles"" things. classic couple. well i take it on myself to figure out the puzzle. so i swipe up and i'm thinking of what it could be, when i realize the letters could spell out ""nudes."" eventually, i send it off as ""nudes? lol"" and put my phone away, thinking she'll realize what i mean and maybe she'll also be glad for the help.

a few minutes later, i get a message from an old coworker of mine (26f) that says ""oh my!!"" i think to myself, ""well that's weird, i haven't talked to her in forever"" so i open up instagram. turns out, while i had been sitting and trying to figure out the puzzle, instagram had cycled through to the next person's story, which belonged to my former coworker who just so happened to have posted a picture of her 3yo son. my heart immediately sunk. i realized my mistake, and went straight into panic mode, showing screenshots of my best friend's sister's story and the like. she said she understood, but at the very best she figures that i was asking someone else for nudes and made up an elaborate story to cover up.

tl;dr was trying to help a friend with a puzzle on instagram and thought the answer was ""nudes"" so i accidentally sent ""nudes? lol"" to a former coworker who had posted a picture of her 3yo son.

"by realizing my history teachers gave me a horribly skewed version of what happened leading up to the civil war.. i had 4 years of rotc in high school and 2 semesters of american history. (2 separate teachers) so, not a history major, but i have absorbed a lot of material on the civil war. and i realized today that it was horseshit and i got hoodwinked.

before that, like most people, when someone asked me why the civil war happened, my answer would have been ""slavery"". and that definitely was an issue. but my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. they gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the north, what europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --there was a lot. and it made sense, because i found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. so they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. again, super plausible. this was all being presented with an attitude of ""now let me tell you what really happened"". 

im six semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the declarations of secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. i had no idea they existed. i read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. they were all about slavery and how it was ""the greatest institution ever conceived"" and that it had to be protected. there's no way this wasn't the forefront issue, after reading those papers. i messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn't remembering wrong and, i wasn't. i told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the secession declarations either. ugh.

reddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong i was. i don't care about people calling me dumb, i'll own that. i just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and i got this...propaganda. i am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. i hope my stupidity is isolated, but i wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don't? 

tl;dr i thought the civil war was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn't, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck.

edit: the fu part of this is that it took me making an ignorant post on a other forum and getting blasted by the reddit community about how completely stupid i was for me to learn about the documents, or the cornerstone speech. which i guess is fair, i dunno. it hurt my feelings, but it shook loose the truth for me.

"by accidentally committing theft as a police officer in full uniform.. poilce don't seem super well liked on reddit but what the hell. this happened a few weeks ago.

i woke up one morning at 5:00 a.m. tired as fuck. i put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on tv or in a video game.

i started my normal routine: got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best ""prepare for a police shift"" album of all time: ""the elder scrolls v: skyrim ost"". now for my 15 minute commute to the city.

my vehicle was getting low on gas so i stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. i went in, put my sausage, egg, and cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. then i grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like i do as the beginning of every shift. after this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.

at about noon, i get a call from my sergeant, who simply said ""i need to talk to you at the department.""

oblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, i began heading to the police department. millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. upon my arrival, i was directed to my lieutenant's office. when i walked in, i heard a stern, ""close the door"". at this point i knew this wasn't good. i sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my corporal. sergeant, and lieutenant.

after a preface from my sergeant, he says, ""tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.

i didn't say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. ""aaawww.......shit. i forgot to pay for my burrito."" then i just heard ""guess what, that's theft.""

after a ""come to jesus"" moment with my superiors, i left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. they didn't want to press charges.

although nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is i can't go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. all they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito. 

on a lighter tone, now other officers have nicknamed me ""the burrito burglar"" and jokingly ask for tips on how to steal stuff when i see them.

tl;dr: i'm a police officer. walked into a gas station i go into every morning and, being in ""autopilot"" mode, i walked out with the same burrito i get every morning, and forgot to pay for it.",4
"by basically buying a serial killer starter kit at my local hardware store.... this happened earlier today and i'm pretty sure i'm on a police watch list now.

needed to pick up a few things from my local hardware store i was running low on that i like to have around. zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. 

while i was there i noticed they were having a store wide sale. i'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up i like to keep certain back up items in my truck if i need them. i figured i would grab some things while they are on sale.

walking through the isles i start randomly grabbing items i think i might need for my kit. such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.

keep in mind i already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when i walk up to the register. these are things i generally purchase, buy never all at once.

girl at the register greets me as i start placing items on the counter. i give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.

about half way through she slows down a bit. she looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. i'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.

then we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:

her: ""wow that's a big knife.""
me: ""yeah i like having cheap, throwaway knives around. same with tarps and stuff too.""
stares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.

her: ""can i see your id to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.""
me being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as i've never been asked for my id here. pull it out and hand it to her. 

she quickly looks at my id info and then glances up at her screen where i noticed my reward info was pulled up. didn't think anything of it at the time.

she says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. almost looking like she was taking inventory of what i had.

she gives me my total and i hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)

i get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. she yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. i grab it as i notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.
i say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.

i get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. she glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.

i was like what? still clueless. before she points out that it looks like i'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.

girl at register must have thought the same thing. checked my info and i'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.

told my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.

tl;dr: 
bought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. pretty sure cashier thought i was a serial killer.",4
"by blowing my load absolutely everywhere during a massage. so this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.

i visited thailand in september '15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. this meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and i never felt ok jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so i decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. i was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.

one morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on koh samui, i decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. after a little splash around i used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, i didn't think much of it. i then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious pad thai.

i suffer from ongoing back pains, so when i hit thailand i took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. now, considering how vulgar my username is, i am actually bit of a prude. i didn't want any ""rug and tug"" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once i start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? not that i'm chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. so, after being a little drunk and full of food i decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.

this wasn't one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. i went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. i asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought i was after anything ""extra"") and got ready. it was only when i started taking my sweatpants off that i remembered that i was free-balling, i explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst i awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.

the first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones i'd had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (i'm a big fan of more aggressive massages), i was in absolute bliss. then came the time for the front. look, by this point i had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had ""awoken the beast"" to some level or another. with this massage i was at absolute full-mast. one of those ""i've not jerked off in three weeks"", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. i apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. she laughed and started working on my legs, i started relaxing a bit more, i imagined it was nothing she hadn't seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. she went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch i imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. i went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.

cum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that i thought i'd broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but i also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. all the while i'm desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. mostly despair. after a short while, the fireworks were over. there was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. i realised that i'd been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. wordlessly i put my clothes on, not making eye contact, i pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. i often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.

edit - typos  


edit 2 - after desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as i could, i received a notification that i'd hit the front page. so, i guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y'all, i still need to work too. in all honesty, i wrote up this event because i had been told i had to during one of the many times i have regaled people with it. i had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so i posted it typos and all. i did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and i am grateful beyond words. every little complement and giggle is doing more good than i think most people would realise. thank you.

"by losing a butt plug nsfw. this happened about 20 min ago.

so last night my girlfriend and i decided to go out to the bars. got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. well last night was the first time we decided to use them. we read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. everything went well but afterwards we couldn't find the plug. this is where the begins. 

we figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. gfs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she's a little extra hungover no big deal. we arrive at mcds to get some greasy hangover food. i order while gf heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. as i take our order back to our table, gf walks over in a panic saying we need to leave now.

she found the butt plug. in our drunken state, we managed to put the entire thing in her ass. handle and all. and now it's sitting at the bottom of a mcdonalds toilet in all its glory.

"by suggesting twin peaks as a joke for the location of a company meeting.. about two months ago there was a page on the intranet for our company for the location of the corporate quarterly meeting.

as a joke i wrote in twin peaks as one of the suggestions.

i am guessing the person running it either wanted to see the world burn or thought the restaurant was like the tv show because it was one of the actual voting options on the intranet. the trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a huge margin.

i am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most rsvp's the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.

the day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. in the entire process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. the organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. the waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.

about an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. by then it was too late. the money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.

i have to hand it to upper management. they powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. although he did start the meeting with. ""i was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company's history, but i think i know why so many of you joined us today."" this drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.

other than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.

it took all of 3 hours after the meeting for it to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.

i was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.

i came in this morning and was informed i am to receive a write up for this. they are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. they understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at twin peaks.

"by cripwalking out of my maths class. no, isn't a joke. this happened less than 2 hours ago.

so you might be wondering, how in the fuck did i manage to cripwalk out of my maths class? why on earth would i do it? well, let me tell you. here i am, chilling in class, while we're doing simple quadratic equations, and one of our classmates could not even comprehend how to solve it. my teacher, of course, gets pissed, and then she catches a student chatting, which led her to losing her shit. she starts saying how we all copy our answers when doing work, and tells us that if we don't enjoy the class, we can exit the room, pointing to the open door.

i sat there hesitating for about a few seconds, thinking ""should i? nahh"" and then thought: it's the end of the year, nothing will happen and everyone would get a good laugh out of this! maybe. but not the teacher.

so i get up, put my books in my bag while everyone is giving me confused looks (including the teacher), and i shit you not, i cripwalk out the door, closing the door on the way out. as soon as i'm outside the classroom, the whole class is fucking howling, literally screaming, you could even hear it from the first floor.

i've been extremely stressed as of late and my boyfriend wanted to help me relax. he flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart's delight. he even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. i really wanted to show him how i much i appreciated all his gestures, so i thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. i start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. he gives me the signal and i activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view i can. that's where the fuck up occurs. i tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. it took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time i figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. at this point, i just sit there and take it up the nose because i'll be damed if i let man gravy get on anything. i immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but i didn't get it all. not long after, i feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. i still have the smell of semen in my nose. 

tldr: a dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose.

edit: holy fuck, i did not expect this to blow up like it did. thank you to whoever gave me my first silver!

edit 2: also didn't expect this to get gold or platinum. thank you all for enjoying my story enough to give me those!",4
"by ruining a movie shoot with jennifer aniston. disclaimer: this should be, ""several years ago ifu,"" but i'm a reddit n00b and wanted to share one of the most awkward series of events i've ever caused.

i had plans to meet up with some friends in atlantic city for the weekend. i got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the taj mahal. i had been there once before, but didn't really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.

i parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. on my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. he let a bunch of people in and, of course, i squeezed through as he was closing it off.

that is where things went sideways. i saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, ""huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if i'll be in it?"" but before i could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. a second later, someone yells, ""action!""

i start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, ""i'm not suposed to be here, am i?"" he immediately shook his head no.

so, i see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two 'extras' are about to get on it. i think to myself, ""if i can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they're doing in the lobby."" 

i make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. success! i didn't screw anything up!

after a few more steps, i catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. and they're blocking the full width, and not walking! i mean, come on!

only at this point, do i see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. then someone yells ""cut!"", and the two people in front of me turn around. 

turns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were jennnifer aniston and gerard butler, and i completely blew up their scene. there was nothing i could do.. i just said, ""uh, i'm sorry."" i figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.

tl;dr. i somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation.",4
"by telling a girl on a first date that i work with deaf children and know sign language.  

so first of all i'll start off with a little context… i don't usually do formal first dates, especially when its with somebody i barely even know. however, i've just come back to university for my final year of studying and i met up with my old flat mate from last year. she had already moved into her new flat and met all of her new flat mates, one of which happened to be a very attractive girl who we will call stacey. now my old flat mate was always trying to set me up on dates last year at university, but i always had an excuse. now with it being a new year i thought ill have a fresh start and really knuckle down and stop going out all the time (i said exactly the same after my 1st year) and focus on my uni work and look for a serious relationship instead of having flings. 

so i get shown a few pictures of stacey and my old flat mate is telling me how nice she seems and how great she is and honestly i just thought why not, i may as well, what harm could going on a date possibly bring about? so she gives me staceys number and we start to text and chat for a couple of weeks and we seem to be getting along really well. so much so that i suggest we should go for some food one evening to meet in person and get to know one another a little better. now bearing in mind i never ever do this, i usually just speak to girls on nights out when i'm filled to the brim with liquid confidence and i'm usually so drunk that my confidence is through the roof. however i feel myself really starting to like this girl, i've never really been one for texting but our conversation seemed to flow naturally.

so i meet stacey at this very busy restaurant last week, i'm full of nerves but i'm ready for the date. we get sat down and we begin chatting away and things seem to be going really well. im still nervous but after a few pints the nerves start to settle and i get a bit carried away telling my stories and my somewhat crude jokes. at the best of times i'm a very loud person, however, after a few beers i turn into a human fog horn and unbeknownst to me, i'm speaking at a level high enough for the whole room to hear. i know this because all of my friends love to remind me how loud i am when we're on a night out. now here comes the fuck up. 

so being full of my favourite ale and with the nerves starting to settle, i'm growing louder and louder by the minute. so much so that stacey, very politely i must say, lets me know that i need to turn the volume down just a tad (especially when telling my alcohol fuelled jokes). now i'm not an angry person by any means, but i can't begin to count the amount of times i've been told to quieten down when drunk, and for some reason i decided this night was the night where i'd have enough. so instead of apologising like any normal person would, drunk me decided it would be a good idea to try and turn it back on stacey. i don't know what come over me but the only excuse i could muster was ""well i do apologise but, you see, i volunteer working with deaf children so i'm used to having to speak really loudly, i've actually just come from there before our date"". 

now if you knew me you would realise how ridiculous this sounds. once i told my friends and my old flat mate about what i had said they were falling to the floor with laughter. so far it doesn't seem that bad, until stacey says something along the lines of ""wow, i'm really sorry, that is great, you must know sign language then?"". drunk me thinking i'd got one up on her proceeded to nod and claim that i do in fact know sign language, i think i even threw up a few fake hand signs which probably looked more like gang signs to cover my tracks. however, what i didn't expect was for stacey to have a younger deaf brother who would apparently love to meet me as she's never dated a guy before who can do sign language!

honestly my heart sank, she was sat across the table from me signing something to me and god knows what she was saying. i just smiled and nodded and to this day i still don't know what she was saying but my unenthusiastic smile and nod seemed to work. i quickly moved the conversation along and got swiftly off the subject. so now stacey thinks i know sign language and what's even better is that she can't wait for me to meet her younger brother who would be so excited to be able to sign with a guy she's dating!

ive tried youtube videos but all i've managed to pick up on is being able to say vowels and ask someones name. i don't have the balls to tell her and i really don't know what to do. im seeing her again next week and i know i need to tell her the truth, she seems the sort of person who would just laugh it off but she seemed so happy when i told her and she's even suggesting we face time her brother when we're next together so i can have a conversation with him. i just feel like a dick now and i don't want to let her down or upset her younger brother, but i don't think asking him his name over and over is going to cut it. 

tl;dr im a loud idiot when i've had a drink and instead of apologising about being such on a first date with a girl, i tried to cover it up by claiming i work with deaf children and know sign language. turned out she has a younger deaf brother who she now wants me to meet and speak to using sign language. i don't have the first clue about how to sign and i don't have the balls to tell her the truth because i don't want hurt her or her brothers feelings.

edit

wow i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, i've just woke up now and had a chance to read through all of your comments, thank you for the platinum and what not, i just want to clear up a few things i've read. 

thanks for all your concern regarding me possibly be a high functioning douche bag alcoholic. first of all when i say really loud, i'm not a boisterous loud, all attention to my please sort of loud, i just speak really loud when i'm drunk enough for other people to hear, it's because i get overly excited and it was a mix of that and the nerves which made me start talking over excitedly and get carried away with the volume. 
also i've seen a few comments about the lying. i know it wasn't right but that's why i tried to stress i never do anything like this, me and in person first dates just don't mix. my nerves just got the better of me and i'm an anxious person at the best of times, i knew right away that coming clean would have been the best thing to do but i'm so awkward that i just didn't know what to say or do and i just wanted to move on the conversation as quickly as possible. i said it in the first place intending it to be a light hearted joke (clearly i'm not funny), i wasn't actually going to roll with the lie that i work with deaf kids. however the last thing i expected was for her to come back with that and it just completely threw me off. i'm seeing her again next weekend so i'll be sure to update you all on how this turns out, thank you for all the advice and the genuine concern a lot of you have, and especially to all of you who have helped me see the funnier side of this situation.",4
"by using my parents pc.. tl;dr at the bottom.

nsfw

this is still fresh in my mind as i'm typing. i take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. today was just a routine visit. my folks live in the country and don't have trash pickup so i visit with dad while driving their garbage to the dump. as we are talking i bring up a video i had seen and suggested i share it with him. he agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests i find the video while he does something else. 

commence fuckup. 
my dad has an older model desktop pc that is quite temperamental and only likes to use google chrome. i go to open a window and see that my dad has 20+ tabs open. all of them were different profiles on fetlife. for those who don't know, fetlife is like myspace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). i just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. unfortunately the tab i opened chrome to was my parents profile page. i not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; i also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. so now, not only do i know my parents are pretty kinky, i also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a christmas turkey. 

tl;dr:
opened google chrome to share something with my dad, only to find out he gets butt-raunched by my mother on the regular.

edit2: wow my first gold! thanks stranger!!

edit 3: my wife is a reddit user and knows her husband posted this from the commute detail. she didn't believe me so she temporarily created a fetlife account so i could, for once, be right. now she is very distraught and has told me she can never look at my parents the same. what do?",4
"by masturbating too hard which led to having surgery. obligatory this didn't happen today but when i was in the 8th grade.

8th grade was about the first time i discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (whatever year they show the ""birds and the bees"" movie at school) well, needless to say, i was all for it. i think i did it just about everyday after school. and i was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.

one day in particular though, i wanted to see how fast i could do the deed. so after school i ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. i counted down from three and went full speed. let's just say i was a little too rough with my ding\-ding.

after i beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times i had ""spatooshed"". i just assumed i over\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so i laid down on my bed to take a nap. the tightness never went away so i had a hard time falling asleep. the tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.

i was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. i told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (i failed to mention that my dangly bits hurt a little bit too) so my dad, being the classic mexican dad that he is, just said ""just drink this 7up and take some tums and you'll be fine in no time."" unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says ""thats it, i can't take it anymore. we're going to the hospital.""

oh. my. lanta. talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  i thought i was going to pass out from the pain. this was my new worst pain of my life.

we eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. i tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. i didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\-dangle. so they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. at this point it's been 2\-3 hours since i got there so i say screw it and i finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum ""hey mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda."" right away she yells why didn't you say something?! then she calls a nurse to take a look.

the nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then manhandles my beanbags! for those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. so this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! i scream in pain. now, i would never hit a woman in my life but i would be lying if told you i didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. haha. remember when i said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.

the surgery was quick and i didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. they went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. i just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then i was back to ""normal"". well, because righty decided to take a left turn at albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. this means righty shrunk. like a lot. lets just say lefty towers over the little guy now. could be worst though. the doctor said 30 more minutes and i would've lost him.

i ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. rob and big, dr. evil and mini me, pinky and the brain are some of my favorites. lol.

lesson to be learned here: some things are meant to be taken slow.

tl;dr  wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.

edit: thank you for the gold kind stranger! glad my story could make your day. :)",4
"by smoking on my apartment balcony (this happened saturday and was without question the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life). this is long and will have a tldr at the bottom.

saturday night my gf and i had my parents over for a  game night. we just moved into our new place last week monday and wanted them to see it. we were waiting on my brother who was running late so i decided to have a smoke on my balcony. 

everything is normal for the first few minutes. i'm just playing some ""free"" game i've spent way too much money on and not aware at all of my surrounding. then it happened. a bug flew in my ear. now this happens occasionally. a bug will fly and hit my ear and be on its way, but this little bastard decided my ear was going to be its new home and dug deep.

i immediately lost all semblance of self control and flung my phone and the chair i was sitting on and sprinted into the apartment while freaking out. the bug was digging or chewing and vibrating and that sound and feeling against your ear drum has to be the worst thing you can ever experience. my gf freezes, my father tells me to get in the shower and just fill my ear with water. i'm helpless at this point so i just follow my dads instructions. 

the bug did not like the water. it dug deeper. the noise and feeling got worse. i used a qtip to try to dig it out. all i got was blood. my father took a used water bottle from my recycling, poked a hole in the cap and used that to try to directly flush the bug. nothing but more digging and moving. i am literally screaming everytime it moves. both from the pain and the disgusting feeling i got when i felt it. 

my mother at this points takes off to run to a store to grab something she thinks will help. i barely notice she leaves but i hope to god she will save me. in the mean time, my gf reads that a couple of drops of vegetable oil can suffocate the bug. so my dad opens our brand new bottle of oil and dumps it in my ear.   at this point my entire body is covered in oil. i could have used concrete as a slip in slide. i'm naked in my shower with a bug in my ear, topped of with oil, holding the shower curtain over my crotch trying to keep some bit of modesty all why freaking out at the chewing next to my brain. 

the oil does nothing but piss it off. we are talking about going to the hospital when my mother returns. she has what looks like the top of a turkey baster. apparently this is something used to suck out booger's from babies noses. my father tries to use it at first because my limbs no longer work. he doesn't go deep enough because he doesn't want to pop my ear drum. i didn't care at that point because the bug was using it as an actual drum already so i managed to regain use of my arm, grabbed the thing and jammed it in my ear. it sucks the bug but it's too big to get it out. too heavy for it to hold onto. 

my gf then fills it with water and suggests i use that to flush the bug. after 4 attempts, i finally feel some relief. i look down on my chest and see something far bigger than i expected. at this point i'm too freaked out to look closely and yell for her to look. she freaks because it's a moth. a good size moth. i again nearly shit myself and rinse it off. 

i can not do justice to this event in words. i can not accurately describe the noise, the feeling, the horror of this. picture it yourselves. imagine you have a dime sized bug in your ear scratching, biting, chewing, digging. then realize it actually feels worse than that. 

if this was punishment for committing crimes, we would no longer need jails. 1 day with a bug in your ear would be enough punishment for murder and i can promise you they wouldn't do it again. 

i'd rather be waterboarded while listening to barney on a loop. those terrorists had it easy. 

i now wear my girlfriends bright pink beats headphones out while smoking and am strongly considering quitting. it shook me that much. 

tldr: a bug flew in my ear while i was smoking. stayed in there for half an hour while i tried everything conceivable to get it out. i finally did. it was more horrific than you can imagine.

edit: i've tried to keep up with the comments so i'll answer some of them here.

i'm still flushing my ear regularly with peroxide. this morning i still found what i think is moth wing residue. i've made an appointment with my primary doctor for 130 this afternoon (eastern time zone us). i'll keep you posted on the egg situation haha. 

i'm now smoking a lot less and mostly when i'm driving . i feel like god would be after me if a bug managed to find its way in my ear driving down the road with the window down only a few inches. 

i didn't expect this to blow up but to everyone commenting saying it happened to them, i'm sorry. i feel your pain. 

to those saying moths don't bite, i'm not exactly a bug expert. all i know is the feeling, the sound, the blood, it was doing something in there that id really rather never experience again. it's truly an indescribable feeling and one i hope you never have to experience.",4
"by leaving my dragon dildos out to dry nsfw. this is literally still happening. maybe it will continue for the rest of my life. maybe this is it for me.

so i live in an apartment-style dorm, but my roommates do not move in for a few more weeks so i am alone in my unit for now. this is very clear because there is a placard with my name and my name only on the front door.

this morning i woke up to the sounds of clanging and walking in my unit. i panicked before my mind supplied ""oh that's the janitor that comes to clean the bathrooms on monday's"". 

and i immediately suffer a heart attack.

it is wednesday. 

i was not expecting a janitor visit. 

in the tub, drying overnight, i had arranged a smorgasbord of sex toy delights: anal beads, a plug, and four dragon/monster dildos of increasing size. lined up. like little sex soldiers.

i hear her open the door to the bathroom, and i lay in the bed in my locked room quiet and still. maybe i'll can stop existing.

i hear some noise, and what sounds like talking.

a few minutes later i hear my ra walk in. i hear some comments and some laughter. they quietly convene for what feels like a long while. the ra simply laments ""why?!"" and the  janitor asks if any boys live in the unit. i continue not to breathe. there are four bedrooms and they don't know which one i use and all the doors are closed so if i continue to be quiet i can astral project off this plane of existence without them noticing.

i currently hear the sounds of a spray bottle, occasionally followed by bag rustling and the tell-tale sound of unsticking a six pound hunk of silicon from a tub. i don't know when she'll leave, if ever. i think i'll be trapped here forever, sweating under the covers from anticipation and embarrassment while she talks and laughs and cleans around my monster dildos.

please send me instructions on how to dissolve into the floor, thanks and have a lovely afternoon.

tl;dr: left all my sex toys out overnight so of course the janitor made a surprise visit this morning and invited the ra to come look at my dragon cocks.

-- / -- / -- / -- / --

update: oh my god this absolutely blew up. i'm going to give an update and answer some questions because i think my phone is going to explode.

-- i emerged from my room about an hour later, my toys were as i left them and there was cleaner in the toilet, so my understanding is that the janitor cleaned the bathroom and perhaps lifted the toys to clean underneath them. i rinsed my things and put them hidden in a drawer in my room. i was waiting to update because i half-expected some communication from my ra but this hasn't happened. sorry the ending isn't juicier but honestly i wouldn't have been able to handle it so i'm thankful.

-- the janitor coming in unannounced is standard procedure. i still have no clue why the ra was allowed in; i'm starting to believe maybe it was, in fact, another janitor? the voice was hushed and i may have misidentified it.

-- a lot of you want pics of the toys. i have a pic of the four in question in a post i made a month or so ago. yes i recommend them, yes they are worth the money.

-- i am ftm, so i am a guy but i currently still have my vagina. i didn't mention my sex or gender because for many reasons it was irrelevant to the story. i put the toys wherever i decide i want them. this clarification is here so that discussion and speculation in the comments is no longer necessary. comments about this aren't going to spark fun or interesting conversations so if you want to argue go do it on a debate forum, not on a funny dildo story.

-- i don't know anything about game of thrones and at this point i'm too afraid to ask

"tifu by selling my nudes to my stepdad. obligatory notice that this happened a couple of days ago, but i'm still recovering from it.



let me introduce myself real quick.
i'm an ethot who sell nudes and feet pics. been doing this for almost 6 months now , cuz life is hard and i need money. i've been reaaally discreet about it tho. my family is too traditional for a closet bisexual hoe like me, and if they were to find out, my head would be on a platter n i knew it. so me, the sneaky know it all i thought myself to be, continued selling nudes n living my best life until the major fuck up  happened.


2 months a ago, an elderly man dm'ed me on twitter  asking to be his sugar babe. knowing the scammers that lurk around, i didn't give much attention to that. his profile was new n anon with a few tweets and no face (has body pics tho) , so my suspicion grew. also, i'm not open about my ethotness on my twitter handle so when he dm'ed out of the blue it felt weird.

but this man was persistent. he dm'ed again after a couple of days, saying that he has noticed the paypigs that follow me and kinda know that i'm an ethot, and if i wasn't one he's sorry. i ignored again. but i was intrigued by this older man who has a decent tl so being the bitch i'm, i started stalking to know if he's legit or not. his page contained mostly political tweets and there was actual people interacting with him. my curiosity grew so i thought it'd be a good idea to text him back- and that's when it all started.


we both kept our anonymity and started having little chats. what started out as  sweet chats transitioned to mad dirty as days went by. he was extremely sweet n sincere . he bought a few of my nudes and then we started trading pics. every night he sent me vids of him jerking off , n i sent him mine. we literally fucked each other virtually. he told he was 45 but his abs said 30 and i was excited to get his dms every night. 18 y/o me somehow felt more valuable cuz  older man with a hot body found my itty bitty titties attractive. it went on like that for a month.

a week ago i got really horny at night n texted him . it was really late but he replied saying his wife is sleeping next to him, and can't sext. i , being the obnoxious dumb doodle i am, somehow thought it'd be a good idea for him to go to the bathroom n film . he did as i said .

i opened the video with the intention of masturbating, but boy, i was in for a surprise.

i noticed the tiles on the wall behind him. at first ,i felt numb , then a shockwave went through my entire freaking body. i recognize the tub. the tiles.the fuckin blue tiles. the same tub i used to bathe. holy fucking shit. that used to be my fuckin room.

my mind went to dumb bitch mode for a while. i sat in my room clueless . tf just happened? did i trip? was that my room? or is my mind making up shit now? the doubt kept me sleepless thru the night. you know the feeling u get when it's your finals next day n you haven't learnt shit? that feeling.

but i wasn't gonna let the doubt kill me.so,to make sure (that i was wrong), the next day i asked him to give me a mirror selfie in his bathroom. and boy, was i right. he's in what used to be my bathroom. the bathroom that i first fucked in. jesus.

i blocked him right away and sat down to process all the mess that happened. i physically revolted. i felt this thing where something goes glsbsks down your chest n abdomen. i virtually fucked my step dad. tf is my life. i don't know what made me feel so disgusted, whether the fact that we used to sext or him cheating on my mom. i felt like telling my mom that he ain't what she thinks he is, but how will i ? we weren't as close as we used to be. ever since she married him i kinda kept a distance. may be that's y i never realized that it was my stepdad. i've only met him in person just twice. also, what evidence would i provide? i felt so disturbed, nauseated and obviously , emotionally scarred. how on earth will i ever face this man again?   pretty sure he's wondering where i  dipped to. and kinda worried to invite them over to my place cuz he know my damn curtains and walls.


tl;dr : sold nudes to stepdad and made him jerk off to me, and now  anxiety and embarrassment are strangling my fucking conscience.


edit: since this blew up i think i should link the dm. it's literally 7:30 here n i haven't slept for over 24 hours so let me get some sleep first. i'll be back. be ready for some laughs at my expense.

"by having sex for the first time in 2.5 years nsfw. obligatory, this didn't happen today, rather three days ago.


i've been single now for three years and haven't knocked boots with anyone in at least 2 so, finally fed up with celibacy and buffered by my friends success story, i joined a dating site.  


i started talking to this pretty good looking guy. he was a little boring, we didn't have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on thursday evening. he looked exactly as he did on his profile (6""8' power lifter who looked like a legit viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that i hadn't been catfiished but i was pretty sure i didn't want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. that said, he didn't seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so i invited him back to mine. 


it started well and i was like fuck yes, let's do this! so i said as much. i also said you're not going to call me back if we do this are you? he said he would. he's a liar. so bullet dodged. 


anyway, he proceeds to pick me up like i weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (i'm pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. i'm like strip because i've gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. at this juncture, i realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but i figure babies come out of there so i'm grand.



there's a warm up wristy and a little spiderman and then we get down to bi'ness. it's over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so i open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he's just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. 


so i'm trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have i got a tissue? my first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse. 


blood.jpeg


so much fucking blood. well, i know it's not a wild period since i'm not afflicted with that shit. i run to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. i'm like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. meanwhile i've never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. 


we have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. i clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. like it'll stop. 


nope. next day is agony and still going. trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know i went on a date and i don't want them thinking i'm some harlot. i'm still optimistic at this point that it'll stop.


wake up saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. but like fresh, bullet wound type blood. and i felt so sick and dizzy. i'm freaking the fuck out. obviously can't tell my mum because catholic shame so i go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who i think thought i had been raped because i was crying so much because i've broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever i think for too long about how this is probably the last time i'll ever have sex and it wasn't even that good. mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she's wonderful.


get in to see the doctor. after a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it's determined that i have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it's on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. brilliant.

theres surgical glue on my vagina. i'm never dating again.

tl;dr: had sex with a giant viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together.

edit: first, wow. i didn't expect this to blow up like this. thanks for reading and thanks for the gold to those who gave it.

second. to clarify, a spider-man as i meant it is also known as the finger trick (middle and ring fingers in, the rest out, pull up repeatedly) although the plah!! spider-man version is also great! hope that helps.

"by forgetting my weed butter in the fridge while my parents staying in my flat. it all happened this morning.

i´m a student  in cologne, germany. my parents visited me over the weekend and stayed in my own flat. yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester. my dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed. next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep. she woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen. i couldn't eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad. so my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some wurstbrot (sausage sandwich). after a few minutes i started eating too. i took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened. i had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies. we made way to much of it so i kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge. yeah.. so i took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the wurstbrot. i was shocked and felt like frozen. i didn't know how to explain or even what to do from there on. my mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right. i asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box. so i started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on. my mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. for her its a real, hard drug.my dads reaction was pretty chill. he started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too. an hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. he started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to amsterdam. i am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! cause my mom isn't fine with it at all.as soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. she is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought i would never do drugs. my dad told me she would calm down soon. they drove home a few hours ago.i think i never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!

tldr: my mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. my dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep.

edit: so my mom called me today. she apologised that she seemed so disappointed she was only afraid of it. she told me that she never came in contact with weed even in her youth. she has absolutely no relationship to it. she said that she is proud of me and that i should be carefully with smoking weed.   
thanks for all the likes, comments and awards! didn't expect that to happen. i try to call my dad later and ask him if he is still into smoking weed.",4
"my friend brought her new date over for dinner and i jokingly vetted him in front of everyone by asking if'd ever killed anyone. he said yes.. as it's often the case, this didn't happen today, but a few years ago when i was maybe 15yo, young and naive.

my mom's best friend back then was v, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.

v is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. after losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. she brought to our home a few men over the years.

one of those times, v had invited over for dinner a man (let's call him a) who she introduced to us as a ""good friend"". a was a middle-aged man originally from bosnia. he now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.

for those of you not fully aware of bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. it's a small country in the balkans (eastern europe, north of greece), and it used to be part of the former yugoslavia. long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including a.

that evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know a better. he seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. we start asking him questions about how long he's been out of bosnia, etc.

i start to think of something witty to say to ""vet"" him. something funny.

i asked him if he'd ever killed someone, jokingly.

he looked at me, all serious. he said yes. everyone became silent.

he went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. they were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person's. he wasn't a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.

i felt horrible for asking this. when i thought i was just making a joke, i opened up some really painful memories. things that were not easy for him. still today, many years later, i can't imagine how he must feel living with such memories. and it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.

after a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. we never spoke about that again.

—

tl;dr: i thought i'd make a funny joke and ask my friends' date at dinner if he'd ever killed anyone. turns out, he did during the civil war in former yugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. the joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day.",4
"by playing music for a sex dungeon. i currently live in an apartment building in seattle. nearby my unit is a man named ""frank"" and his girlfriend (who is quite vocal, thus why i know her boyfriend's name). now frank and his girlfriend have incredibly loud sex throughout the entirety of friday and saturday nights. annoyed by all of the sound and trying to find a way to blot it out, i began a habit a few months ago of playing music (singing, playing guitar) whenever they would start doing the dirty over the course of the last couple months. as an added bonus, i could hear my neighbors yell ""sing"" throughout the night, so i assumed that my playing was a helpful solution to an unfortunate circumstance borne by all of the other neighbors around me.

&#x200b;

however, tonight, i noticed something kind of strange. they were having sex, per usual, and i began to play music to cover up the sound. i stopped to drink some water between songs, when some of my neighbors started yelling ""play."" for some reason, though, i didn't do anything for a few seconds, and i heard the guy, frank's, voice call out ""keep playing or i'm not going to cum"" through the walls. i listened a while longer to see if i'd heard correctly, and they both kept moaning the same thing. it was at this point that i came to a terrible conclusion. in my attempts to cover up the sound of them having sex, i managed to pull some weird pavlovian trick where whenever they had sex, i played guitar and sang. thus, whenever i started to play guitar to cover up an original sound, it just added to their voyeuristic thrill and they started to depend upon it to finish. when i'd heard my presumed neighbors yell sing, it was actually frank and his girlfriend. unsure if i was right, i started playing another song and when i finished, they were going as hard as possible and moaning heavily so i figured that i'd assumed correctly.

&#x200b;

my neighbors them get understandably angry that my music playing has made this neighbor couple have sex, so then ***they*** begin to have really rough revenge sex against my wall because they think that i've caused this problem (which i have). at this point, i'm listening to frank and his girlfriend and the couple next to my wall, one couple horny and one full of revenge, and all of this was because i tried to save myself from listening to sex in the first place.

&#x200b;

edit: here's a video i uploaded as proof that i'm actually playing music. they weren't having sex this morning, so everyone will have to leave that part to their imagination.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyop3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyop3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be)

2nd edit: wow, this really blew up. hopefully everyone enjoyed the story! regarding proof of their sex, i'm not going to record the sound of my neighbors screwing and upload it to the internet, so my apologies there. to answer everyone's questions, the song is an original, but i've never recorded anything professionally and i play as a hobby. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr: thought i was covering up sex sounds with music, turns out i was serenading a couple while they fucked and keeping them horny all night. neighbors had angry sex against my bedroom wall as revenge for disturbing their sleep because i acted as a musical facilitator.",4
"i said no to my gf's proposal.. warning: this is a long one. scroll down to the tl;dr if you don't want the full story. 

yeah... i f***ed up today. see, i've been dating my gf (k) for 5 years. we are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. i've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. the reason i haven't is that about 2 years ago, i got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

it's been very rough on the two of us, but k has stuck with  me every step of the way. my disease, gpa, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. i'm starting drugs that haven't been fda approved for my condition. all other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. this new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. i'm terrified to say the least. all of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

i want to be healthy and stable before i even think about marriage. i don't want to leave k as a widow with no support! k & i had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that i needed to go into remission first. we agreed to it, or so i thought. flash foreword to a few hours ago and k is with my family in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

i saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. i immediately started freaking out. first thought: i haven't even gone into remission yet and i have no clue if i'm going to get better. i cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. what if i die from all of this? second thought: goddamn it dad! why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

i guess i'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my dad was a very involved parent when i was young. when i entered high-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. the expectations would get so high that i couldn't live up to them. similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. both my brothers and i find this to be a real problem, if my dad is left unchecked. i would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. back to the story!

anyway, i'm freaking out. i just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" with my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, i ran out of the building... i made the love of my life cry as i selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. i've never felt so ashamed in my life... after calming down, i talked to my mother, and drove back to talk to k.

in the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. tears were shed and things were said. k told me i was being selfish. ""we've been dating for years, who cares if you die, i want to marry you!"" she also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. she understood why i would be paranoid about my dad though. k understands that my dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

in the end, we reconciled. we made up, decided that i was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. we came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. we want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

now i'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if i do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, i'll be with my best friend/lover. k is my world, and i'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

thanks for listening.



tl;dr
i said no when my gf proposed bc i'm on chemo and don't know if i'm gonna go into remission or die. decided i was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.

edit: thank you so very much for the silver, gold and platinum!",4
"by going to my parents house, and now i need to bleach my eyes.. literally happened ten minutes ago, the fallout has yet to happen.


bit of a backstory, i (26m) live about 45 minutes from my parents house, and my eldest sister (30f) lives across the street from me but works close to my rents.


my parents, and my youngest sister (15f) are out of town on vacation. now, i generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. plus i live in an apartment complex and don't have a garage).


so i'm going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.


this is where it happens. now, my parents have two dogs. and i was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as i knew my eldest sister was house sitting and i didn't want them to lose their shit.


this is where the fuckup happens.


it works. i'm quiet. i sneak into the house, and silently close the door. i heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so i go, thinking the dogs were playing.


it was not the dogs playing.


it was, in fact, my eldest sister and her boyfriend. on the couch.

with her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.


i have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.


i also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process. 


and what she sounds like.


i literally screamed ""my eyes"" covered them and ran out of the house.


i'm outside, sitting in my truck contemplating my life.


send help.



tl;dr parents home is vacant other than my sister dog sitting. went to work on my truck, saw my sister getting worked on, reverse cowgirl style.


edit: based on a lot of the responses, apparently reddit wants me to either a) describe my sisters tits, b) make a porno, or c) go all r/sweethomealabama with her.
y'all are animals.

edit 2: holy shit this blew up. damn. what happened after was as i was sitting in my truck, they left. i went into the garage and did my work. we haven't talked yet. i'm gonna give it a few weeks for the memory to not be burned into my skull.",4
"by going for a walk and accidentally traumatising a woman for life. obligatory ""happened a few years ago etc"" but basically there was this walking/bike path near my house that i would occasionally walk along for exercise.

sometimes, while walking, i'd set myself a personal goal, like ""reach that pole by the end of this song"" or whatever (i listened to music while i walked).

well, one time i saw someone walking in front of me. they were a considerable distance ahead of me, but i decided that my goal that night was to overtake them by the time i reached my turnaround point.

so i started walking faster to catch up and overtake them, and realised it was a woman. at the time i didn't think anything of it, because, hey, we're both on the same walking path for the same reason; getting healthy.

as i slowly yet surely got closer to her, i noticed she would occasionally turn her head and look behind her. i'd had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, i only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, i'd turn around and look behind me, because i thought she may have heard a bike bell that i hadn't heard over my music. meanwhile i kept my speed up because i was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.

near to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it's of course here that i finally catch up with her..

as i get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what i can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). aimed directly at me.

i immediately realise what i've done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).
i gave her the most awkward smile in the world while i powerwalked past her, walked wayy past my turnaround point so i could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.

as an added ""bonus"", i later learned that there was a notorious rapist named ""the bike path rapist"" that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.

tl;dr decided to race a stranger without their knowledge, awkwardly followed them, caught up to them in the darkest section of the path, nearly got bruce lee'd, awkwardly smiled and powerwalked away.",4
"by flipping off my four year old neighbor.. i'm a salty fucker. i'll admit that from the jump. i can't stand the family that lives across the street because their kid is always fucking freaking out and screaming, slapping shit, having tantrums, throwing shit across the street and into my yard...you name it, he does it. i can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. he's a little fucking hellion. 

his hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when i get into my car and leave for work. i got so sick of being stared at by this little asshole, so i flipped him off and gave him a nasty look as i was getting into my car. he immediately started screaming and crying. as i drove off, i felt...weirdly satisfied. seriously, it was the most fulfilled i'd felt in weeks. so, i immediately did it again the next day, the next one after that, and the day after that. each time he'd start screaming and freaking out. it made me bitterly happy.

this morning, as i was getting ready to leave, i saw the demon child in the window again...giving me the stare...and i flipped him off. only this time i heard the bellow of ""hey fucker!"". the kid's fucking dad had been standing behind him and i didn't see him. i sprinted into my car just as he came running out of the house. i got in before he caught up with me, but that still didn't stop him from throwing a potted plant at my tail light.

"by wearing my late grandfather's shoes to a job interview. this happened january, 2018.

i was desperate to find a new job and was basically applying for anything that was asking for at least a bachelor's degree. to provide some background, i graduated with a sciences degree and there was a job posting for a junior risk management position at an accounting firm that allowed folks with a stem major to apply. and so i did even though i barely knew anything about the field of accounting or risk management. but hey, might as well.

surprisingly, they invited me to do a ""1-on-0"" interview where you basically stare at your computer webcam and answer questions that the company has prepared for you ahead of time while recording your answer... it's a pretty awful experience. however, they were all soft-skill questions so i could answer them pretty decently. after that, i surprisingly got an invitation to have an interview in-person at their office. i was very excited.

now for the fuckup: my family has an assortment of dress shoes that i could wear for the interview and i ended up grabbing a pair that belonged to my late grandpa. they were lookin fresh. i put em on and my parents dropped me off in front of the building.

i entered the building and entered the conference room where the other 5 candidates were alongside some company reps. i was cool as a cucumber and just sat in my seat until everyone arrived. right as everyone got up to enter the ""group case"" room, i looked down at my feet and noticed there were these black things scattered all around my shoes. i quickly deducted that they were shoe crumbs.

it turns out that the shoes i wore were so old and no one had worn them since... a long ass time ago. they were so old that the polymer in the soles were extremely brittle and my shoes were deteriorating in front of my eyes solely due to pressure and friction.

at that moment, i was just thinking ""oh god oh man"" but didn't want to let anyone know about it so after i got up, i pushed in my chair to hide the shoe crumbs. unluckily for me, everywhere i walked more traces of my shoes came off, leaving a trailing of black shit behind me. it was a nightmare. thankfully the carpet was greyish color so it wasn't too prominent with my black shoe crumbs but it was only a matter of time before people were going to notice. we walked to a different conference room nearby where we did a group case. it didn't go too well and i left another big mess in there but oh well.

afterwards, we were going to do the in-person interviews with the company directors and partners and divided us into two groups where three of us would go the interview first and the other three would do it after. i was a part of the latter team so we had time to kill. one of the company reps wanted to show us around the two floors and in my mind i was screaming. i wanted to minimize walking to prevent my shoes from breaking off even more.

i ended up leaving a trail of crumbs all throughout both floors and then we decided to grab some starbucks on the main floor. when i went to go grab a straw for my iced coffee, a giant block from my right shoe came off. holy shit. i kicked it into the little condiments corner and hoped no one saw. we sat down at a table until our turn for interview was approaching. on the way back to the office floor, a second massive chunk came off, this time from my left shoe. however, this time i was in the middle of the cafeteria and couldn't go back to grab it or something. so i just continued walking and just left this black shoe turd in the middle of an open space. at this point, so much of my shoes have fallen off that i was starting to walk weirdly, as my shoes has gotten so much fucked at this point.

we got back to the conference room and the moment i entered the room, i noticed two other people hovering around where i was sitting originally and said ""what's all this black stuff?"" looking at debris i had left earlier. i pretended to not hear them and sat at a different chair, attempting to engage in conversation with someone else. at this point, i was 99% sure everyone knew it was me. however, i continued to play innocent and not acknowledge the amount of debris i was leaving behind everywhere.

finally, it was my turn to do the interview and i walked to yet another office to do it, and of course that meant leaving more shoe crumbs along the way and in the boss's office. he told me he was gonna take a quick bathroom break after we entered and will be right back. i was so glad he did that as i frantically picked up the crumbs that i had already laid waste upon his office and quickly stuffed as much as i could in my pockets while he was gone. as i was doing this, all i could think was ""how did it come to this..."". the interview itself went pretty well though.

after everyone was done, the reps ended up buying lunch for us at a nearby restaurant. all i can say is rip to the cleaning staff over there. by the time i got home, you could almost look through my shoe, top-down.

needless to say, i did not get the job.

tl;dr: wore old af shoes to an interview, the soles began to deteriorate as i walked around and shuffled them, leaving an absolute disaster of a mess all around their offices as i continued to not acknowledge that i was the culprit even though i'm very certain everyone knew it was me.",4
"by shaving my butthole before a first date.. edit1: technically ""trimmed"" not ""shaved""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

so the happened last night, but this requires some background explanation...

this is gonna be tmi, but that's kinda the nature of tifu, so whatever. i'm a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. i also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and i don't know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (aka the taco bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it ain't fun. so i had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. so i trimmed it off at night, added some aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. win-win!

fast forward two days, and i'm going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she's like the best looking girl i've dated, so i wanna shell out the monies of course. dinner went pretty well, and we got coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren't home) for a movie. turns out they aren't home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.

but, guys, i can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  we're sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and i just had to let one out. i'm usually pretty good at silent farts, so i'm not paying attention to the fact that we're in a quiet spot in the movie. and this fart was not silent! it was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart i've ever had in my entire life, hands down. i was mortified. she immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and i of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. she did not laugh with me...no text-backs so far.

i googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. so a little there for you inside this tifu. just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so i can go on dates again.

&#x200b;

edit2: man i shouldve used my real account for the awards! guess i'll have to switch over to this baby.

tl;dr - i shaved my butthole to make wiping easier and prevent rashes. turns out it makes your farts super loud, which i discovered during a movie in my apartment on a date, which ended awkwardly and soon after.",4
"by listening to my gf's obviously stupid game.. so, yesterday my girlfriend and i were playing around, you know as lovers do...naked. some time in this whole play activity, she asked if i could stick my penis in a bottle.

now, this was a weird thing to me but i thought maybe it was one of her fetishes so i went ahead and did it. it didn't fit in the first two bottles we could find (yes i know...humblebrag) but the third one had a wide enough neck/opening for at least most of it to go in rather snuggly. she started laughing and i started forcing a fake laugh and then asked her, how long she wants me to do it for. she never replied and then she just started playing with the part of my twig and berries that was not in the bottle...causing me to get hard. she knew what she was doing was causing this but would not stop. i begged her to stop but she would not stop and continued to stroke me. now my dick was straining and i started to get really worried. then she started screaming...blood was coming out of my dick.

long story short, she started crying and finally stopped. the bleeding continued for a few minutes (only small amounts). since yesterday, peeing still hurts. she thought i wouldn't be stupid enough to proceed with putting my limp dick in a snuggly fitting bottle.

tl;dr i fucked up my dick by putting it in a bottle.

**edit**: so my girlfriend saw the post and says she's embarrassed and wants me to take it down.

if you come back here to check, no i'm not taking it down, i am the one with the sore dick and no one can tell from the story that it is us because we told no one (well i hope you didn't). sorry, i'm keeping it up. see you at 8.",4

there's no way people were just finding this place on their own. it was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. so, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.

last night, i went there to get some food... for research, ya know... anyway, i was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. the pizza was really good. the beer selection was varied. they had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. pretty good stuff. even if i wasn't writing for them, i would've given them 5 stars on yelp, is what i mean.

when i was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.

i wrote a lot of garbage for a while (""where wine country is next door!""), but i was determined to get something usable. 

finally, it hit me: ""go somewhere."" it had nearly everything i wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.

but, still, it wasn't quite there. it lacked the feel i wanted, felt a little too abstract. customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. they needed to be pointed.

after another hour or so, i had it.

eventually, the slogan i pitched these poor people was this:

""go somewhere else""

which, i believe the corporate equivalent of is like ""get the fuck out of my face.""

they haven't emailed me back.

tl;dr: today i fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan i wrote and i'm pretty sure i definitely lost a client because of it.",4
"by using the faceapp everyone's been raving about. so i guess this is a bit of a change from your normal posts but i felt like sharing anyways.

so this just happened like an hour ago. i'm sure you all have heard about the ""revamping"" of the faceapp where you can literally age a photo of yourself. for those who don't know what i'm talking about, here(https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/faceapp-old-age-face-photographic-filter-mobile-app-development-russia/) is a good reference for you.

anyways, so i saw someone post a picture to their instagram and that's how i heard about it. i knew i had to download it and try it out...because why not?

so i download the app, take a picture and set the filter. 

and omg i'm totally old lol. it's kinda crazy, and i'm not gonna lie...i look good as an old dude.

i decided to send the results with the original picture  to some friends and family who just die laughing at the filtered image. we start comparing pics and wonder if that's how we will really look in the years to come.

then a thought pops into my head...

everyone tells me i look just like my dad, and if that's true maybe he will get a kick out of this photo too! so i send it away!

...nope.

he isn't excited, and he isn't laughing. he said it freaks him out.

i asked him why, and assured him it's just a harmless filter.

what he said next broke my heart.

""i know i'll never see you that old.""

tl;dr: i used the crazed faceapp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. fuck.

edit: whoah!! did not expect this response. thank you strangers for my first gold!!!

edit 2: thank you for my second and third gold!!! wow.",4
"by not wearing pants to a job interview. this happened today, 8:30am.

i cannot even try to make an excuse for how i could have literally forgotten a vital piece of clothing.

i got pretty close. i donned my favourite opaque tights and chose my shirt then i proceeded to get distracted by some forms i had to complete online, ran short on time, put on my long winter parka and left the house.

i got up to the interview feeling very comfortable and fifteen minutes early. as the receptionist told me to go hang up my coat i gladly walked over to do so. i began to unzip my jacket, looked down and for a brief moment i thought my skirt had just ridden up on my commute. nope, nothing there. luckily i never fully took off my jacket.

i proceeded to turn on my heel and leave. i got downstairs but was still holding the coat hanger.

i didn't want to be a theif on top of just leaving abruptly. so i then took the elevator back up, claimed a family issue, and returned the coat hanger.

silver living is they let me reschedule. so now i have an interview for later this afternoon. in about an hour.

tl;dr left my house without any pants on for a job interview then absconded with company property

edit: i think the job interview went well. i appreciate everyone's encouragement, and also thank you for the silvers.

i'm also happy (?) that so many other people have gone to work in various states of undress.

and to the people who are/ are now afraid of coming to their work places 'naked': i'm sorry! this was also a latent fear of mine too, and the stuff of my nightmares. i can't believe it actually happened and that 'checking for pants' will now become part of my routine.",4
"by eating first and asking questions later.  

my fiance and i have been eating keto for the last 3 months. she recently bought these ""butter bombs"" that you put in your coffee/hot tea that adds fat to your diet. i saw half of one on the countertop and decided to give it a go because i hadn't used one yet.

i proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. i threw it in the blender and glugged it down. i thought it was weird that it didn't melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. it didn't taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.

smash cut to later in the evening when my fiance says to me as i'm watching tv, ""hey have you seen the other half of the air freshener wax that was on the countertop?"" smh. my fat ass thought it was food. i suppose i should go on amazon now and leave a review. 5 stars, would eat again.

 tl;dr i ate air freshener wax thinking it was a keto ""fat bomb"" because i'm a fat ass.",4
"by mistaking my coffee thermos for my wife's.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but happened a while back.

&#x200b;

so for christmas, my wife got her and me matching coffee thermoses. hers was copper tinted, mine was stainless steel. apart from that they were identical. i loved it! but after a while, being the absent minded person that i am, mine goes missing. ""no biggie"", i said to myself, ""my wife is staying home today, i'll just take her thermos to work."" so i fixed me up a nice thermos full of black coffee, and headed out the door to work.

this particular day was rather busy, and i had meetings back to back pretty much all morning. i had my thermos and laptop in tow, and was migrating from one conference room to another, when i realized i needed to run to the urination station. so i dropped off my laptop and thermos, ran and relieved myself, then stopped back by my cubical to pick up a couple of reports for the meeting.

while sorting the papers at my desk, i reach over and grab for my thermos and take a big swig of coffee. immediately, a few alarms and thoughts went through my head. ""this coffee got pretty cold pretty fast today...that's odd. also i don't remember putting any cream or sugar in it this morning...that's odd. also what is this texture??""

at this point, still mid-gulp, i shift my eyes down to the top of the thermos, which has a clear plastic lid, and i notice a very large floating blob of mold, which i had just taken a sizable chunk out of. also i notice the thermos is stainless steel, not copper colored.this was my coffee that had been sitting on my computer desk, in plain sight, for a month. oh no...i thought as i immediately reach for the trashcan to try and lurch the coffee back out, but to my disappointment it would not come back up. so i run to the bathroom and try a full on puking position to try and get it back up, again no luck. i just knew i was going to get deathly ill, but actually i didn't get sick beyond the mental stress of having just consumed an entire family of slimy, chunky mold spores and rotten cream.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: took my thermos to work, forgot about it. took my wife's to work a few weeks later. accidentally drank from my month old coffee and got a nice dose of penicillin and rotten cream.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit:  my apologies to anyone i made chunder this morning!

edit 2: for clarification - i just borrowed my wife's thermos, filled it with fresh coffee, and took it to work. hers wasn't the moldy one. mine was, as it had been setting at my desk for a month.",4
"by thinking my welsh - english bi lingual boyfriend was having a stroke, i caused a car crash. i've been with him for roughly a month and i knew he spoke welsh fluently but i've never heard him, or anyone speak welsh. 

we are driving to his house and he's on a call with one of his friends so i'm just sat on my phone, relaxing, enjoying the hills. well, he suddenly starts speaking welsh and flinging his arms around, apparently having some sort of an argument. ive never heard welsh before and tbh, it sounded more like lots of slurring. 

i legitimately thought he was having a stroke so i grabbed the steering wheel, he did the exact same thing but in the opposite direction, he out strengthed me, we span around on the road and came to a stop. 


he was so confused as to why i randomly grabbed the wheel. i explained the situation and now his welsh family and friends are having a great laugh at my mono-language self.

tl;dr

"chatting with my gynaecologist. so, i went in for a routine lady checkup right. these visits are awkward from start to finish... the hype yourself up to be able to leave the house, the play-it-cool conversation before taking your pants off.. and oh god, the cleaning beforehand. pretty sure i've discovered a new layer of skin from all the scrubbing. pubic hair? what is that. 

so, enter the doc's office. awkward prelims, tick. pants off, tick. on the table (please tell me this piece of disposable paper has been changed since the last patient) my ass is vulnerable right now

fast forward to the speculum *shivers* now it's just silence. silence and this guy, just having a stare off with my lady taco. after a few horrifying silent seconds, i decide it would be a good idea to make small talk. (only god knows why) clearly out of creative ideas, i blurted ""a lot of cobwebs up there"" 

the doc stops moving and chuckles awkwardly.. after what feels like an eternity he says, ""not having an active sex life then?"" 

awesome. no. i meant the ceiling!!! your ceiling. not my vagina. *crawls into a hole and dies*

for some reason he thought this was way funnier then i did. so yep. should i change gynaecologists, can't bear to 'face' him again.  😅😅

"by finding my gf's porn videos and confronting her about it. this actually did happen today and i'm still kind of shaken up from my initial reaction.


basically me and my gf of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. we're both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. long distance is hard as fuck, so summer is a great time for us to fuck like catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. fortunately she's on the pill so we don't have to use condoms. great right? wrong.


last night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn't in the mood. i went home with blue balls, and decided that i was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. after going in and out of sleep, i eventually decided that i needed to get off, and ol' reliable would have to do.


i loaded up pornhub and started browsing through the videos until i found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. i got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. the girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. exactly like my girlfriend. i was thinking ""oh cool this is basically like jerking off to moving nudes"", and began to jack it.


but once the fucking started, my heart stopped. she had the same birthmark as my gf did, same spot below her ass, same shape and everything. this wasn't a look alike, this was my girlfriend. i grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.


i checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. i was hesitant, but clicked on it. turns out this wasn't a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen i was looking at page after page, video after video of my gf being railed by giant porn dicks. my girl wasn't as innocent as i thought. she was a porn starlet.


i was so fucking torn right then. so many feelings started running through my brain. it now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. she was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.


i then started freaking out about stds. none of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. we were both each other's firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now i was terrified i had been duped. not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. i realized that it was late enough that i couldn't do anything so i went to bed again.


i woke up the next morning in cold sweats. i was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. i sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book i could think of. i called up my doctor's office and scheduled an std test. fortunately they could take me right then so i drove over. 


after the tests were finished, i got a text from my girlfriend. ""what the fuck are you talking about???"". i was even angrier than before. that little bitch was gonna act dumb about it?  i was furious, but i had evidence. she wasn't gonna get out of this one without some explaining. 


i fired up pornhub again to find the videos, but i couldn't find the casting one i started on last night. no worries, i remember her stage name. i typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what i found. not because i was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren't there. they didn't exist.


now i was just fucking confused. i tried other porn websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. i knew i saw them last night tho, so i knew they were there though, right?


and that's when the realization hit. remember how i said i was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? it was all a dream. a very bad dream. my brain decided that a great dream to have would be my girlfriend being a pornstar, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.


so here i am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how i had a dream she was a pornstar without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names i called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could've turned out. fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so i think we're good for now.


tl;dr: had a very realistic dream that my gf was doing porn, gave myself a heartache, sent her a very angry text over nothing, and wasted my morning in a doctors office taking std tests for diseases i don't have.


edit: ok holy shit this blew up overnight. i can't reply to most of the comments/questions/concerns so i'll try to break it down by groups that i see most frequently commenting.


for everyone saying the relationship is done: surprisingly not. she took it pretty well and were talking this through pretty openly. i'm gonna go over later tonight in person just to make sure, but it hasn't gone nearly as bad as i thought it would.


for the conspiracy theorist: nah, the videos don't exist. she didn't pull them or anything, there were enough videos that on a normal ph page there would definitely be at least one re upload. i checked my browser history, nothing there, and nothing is ever deleted on the internet, and i trust my gf so i'm fine on that note.


for the ""yta"" crowd: yeah i know that's why this is on and not on wholesome stuff or smthn.


for the ""sex work is real work, you're just misogynistic"" crowd: sex work is a real job and i'm not contesting that. i also don't care if my partners body count is as long as troy polamalu's hair, or as short as oj simpsons prison sentence. what i got mad at was that she was currently banging dudes without my knowledge, breaching my trust of her, and crossing a deal breaker for me. obviously it never happened but that was what i was mad at, not anything else.


for everyone getting mad at me for not knowing how porn std tests work: thanks. now i know i guess?


also shout-out to the one guy who thinks it's fake solely bc he never heard of jacking off in bed before. can't find your comment but it gave me a good chuckle.",4
"by receiving 2nd degree burns on my butthole.. so this happened roughly about 4 hours ago. insert generic ""i'm on mobile"" text here. 

so i was getting ready for work and stepping out of the shower.
i don't know about you guys, but i really like to use a hair dryer on
every part of my body. i've got hair all over my body, so it makes sense i guess.

i use the hairdryer to dry my (head) hair, then my torso and then my legs... and then...
my butt. you see, i'm a guy and there's some hair down there. it's not always
easy to dry it with a towel so i just use the hair dryer. 

i would get out of the shower, use a towel to dry myself as much as possible 
and then let the hair dryer do the rest.

for the last 10 years this technique has worked perfectly fine.. except for today.

you see, somehow my hands were still wet. for some reason i didn't notice this. so
while i was spreading my butt cheeks to dry the hair between them the hair dryer slipped
out of my hand. i quickly cought the power cable but by doing that the hair dryer was rammed
directly between my buttcheeks while it was still on.

the hair dryer was on the highest setting and the moment it hit my butthole i was shocked.
i instantly clenched my buttcheeks together while the hairdryer was still in there and running.

god, i can't tell you how much this fucking hurt. it still does. it's literally the worst pain.
like, i know the anus is relatively sensitive but this was just pure hell. the pain was so horrible
i was literally unable to loosen my butt cheeks. the hairdryer was blowing hot, and i mean hot air directly on my butthole
for about 7 full seconds. i managed to get my shit together and pull the plug.

but by the time i pulled the plug the damage was already done. i fell on the floor and puked all over
the place. the pain was unbearable. i was crying, screaming and i think i even might've passed out for
a couple of seconds at a time.

i was laying on my bathroom floor for 30 miniutes trying to somehow live through this immeasurable pain.

it was horrible. but after half an hour of laying there i realized i had to move, this had to be treated, so i tried to reach for my phone to call help. but when i tried to crawl to my phone i realized that the hair dryer was still
between my butt cheeks!

so i tried to pull it out and that was the second time i puked due to the pain. when i got it out it was covered
in bloody/burnt off parts of my butt's flesh. i have no clue how it looks down there but it can't be any better than
how i'm feeling right now.

i eventually managed to call my girlfriend. she drove me to the hospital.

so... that's basically it. i'm currently laying in a hospital bed. the wound has been 'treated'. it was so humiliating.
the pain is still horrible but they gave me painkillers so i guess that'll help.
this is literally the worst day of my life. i've not only felt the worst pain you can imagine, i've also never been
more embarrassed/ashamed.

but i really have to give credit to the nurses/doctor who treated me. they did perfect. they tried to cheer me up
and they were totally nice. i'm so grateful.

also, i really hope i could explain this properly but if you had problems here's a visual depiction of what went down:

https://imgur.com/a/yinsqgn

so, if you're reading this you've probably stopped laughing by now. so thank you for reading this giant wall of text.

i'll try to keep you guys updated.

tl;dr: i received 2nd degree burns on my butthole after i accidentally rammed my hair dryer between my butt cheeks.

***edit***: insert generic rip inbox line here. time to make my first edit. so, the last couple of hours have been a  blast. you guys are so f*cking amazing. your responses are the best things i've seen all year tbh. i'm glad i could make some of you laugh. you people brought me joy and happiness. it really sucks laying in this bed. i might get released soon. the wound has been cleaned but we have to keep an eye on it so it doesn't get infected. the doctor said the worst part is over but pooping will be a problem. but thanks to all your happy comments i'll manage, hopefully. oh, my gf finally stopped laughing; better tell her to order some aloe vera quickly ;)

***edit2***: for the people wondering why i need a hair dryer for my entire body. here's a selfie: https://imgur.com/a/xzm7unc

***edit3***: here's a video of the aftermath https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eqf0ea-tjm&feature=youtu.be

***edit4***: holy hell, this story is everywhere on reddit. well, despite all the agony i'm so incredibly glad to see how many people it reached. you guys are the best. this has been the worst day of my life but all your support and help made it better. you've helped me live through this terrible day. thank you.  https://imgur.com/a/jphbzho

***edit5, the morning after***: so i woke up about an hour ago and i had to poop. it was mostly soft and the skin wasn't stretched that much but holy fuck that hurt. i was able to clean my butt on a bidet so that's alright for now. this might be my last edit on this post. maybe i'll post an update in a few weeks/months. anyways, i'm gonna focus on my recovery. to all the kind commenters: you're amazing, never stop! https://imgur.com/a/mmsrprd",4
"and my son ended up thinking santa clause was stealing penises.. so my wife comes home after picking our two youngest kids up from school. she opens the door and goes, ""did you say something about santa clause stealing penises?""

i reply, ""i didn't say any shit like that. i would never ruin christmas.""

here's how we got there:

i have two daughters and a son. my son was 3 or 4 at the time. he refused to wear clothes and ran around naked or in his underwear. my daughters weren't having any of it and were like, ""this is your department, old man. do something.""

i tried to reason with my son and that just didn't work. i was thinking that i needed something to use that he was afraid to lose. he's a tiny kid. he'll play with a cardboard box and be happy. 

that's when he came running past me with both hands on his junk. that's it. he loves his dick. i love my dick. me and my penis are tight. 

so my son and youngest daughter are eating lunch. i look across the table and go, ""hey big guy, you know how sometimes you can't go to sleep cause you think there's something in your closet?""

hesitantly, ""... yes.""

""i didn't want to scare you but you're old enough to know now.""

his eyes got wide and my daughter had a puzzled look on her face. she's 4 years older. 

i go, ""there's a goblin that lives in your closet. and if you don't do what you're supposed to, like wear underwear and clothes, he creeps out at night while you're asleep and steals your penis.""

he incredulously responds, ""nah ah.""

i reassure, ""oh yeah. what do you think happened to your mom and sisters?""

at this point my youngest daughter loses her mind laughing. she's holding her sides and almost falls out of her seat. 

my son was dead silent. i could almost hear him thinking, ""damn... they don't have dicks.""

so where does santa clause come in?

after i told my wife i would never ruin christmas, she tells me she heard our son say to our daughter, ""you must have done something really bad for santa clause to steal you penis.""

my guy confused goblins with santa somehow and thought santa clause was roaming around with a big red sack full of stolen dicks. 

fear not. i straightened him out. i googled pics of santa and pics of goblins from the movie labyrinth. 

tldr: tried to scare my son into wearing under wear and he ended up thinking santa clause was stealing dicks.

"by having sex with a tampon in, losing it, and having to get my professor remove it (nsfw). this happened last night. put a tampon in around 6pm and went about my evening activities. i had a busy night, but at the end of the night i got to see my boyfriend. totally forgot about the tampon and we had sex. i have a pretty light flow/low key periods due to an iud, so between that and my busy day i totally forgot i had a tampon in. 

we wake up this morning and i remember. my stomach drops. i immediately go to the bathroom and i can't feel it. its gone. i tried switching positions, squatting, had my boyfriend try, everything i could think of. nothing. after close to a half hour of trying, hoping, and praying to the vagina gods, i accept my fate. this shit is gone. 

at this point i'm worried that i'm never finding this thing and it's going to be stuck inside of me forever. i also know the risk of contracting tss if i keep it in much longer so i know i need to get it taken care of sooner rather than later. after class i'm off to our student health center. i go to a small college, so the doctor is only in for an hour a day. i strategically timed it so that i wouldn't see the doctor-- he teaches one of my classes, gen med, at night once a week. i wasn't keen on having my professor dig through my vagina to find a lost tampon, so i was hoping the nurse could do it. 

nurse is very nice and reassuring but says i have to wait for the doctor. great. some time later i'm in a gown, in the stirrups, waiting for my professor to come in, just full of dread. he comes in and is super friendly because he knows me from class, which is the last thing i wanted. really wish he would have just stayed silent at this point and pretended that he didn't know me. 

he starts the vaginal exam and the following exchange occurs:
dr, to the nurse: ""well, she got some pretty good news last night""
me: "".........""
dr: ""theres no final in gen med!""
me: ""..oh""

i for real thought he was commenting that the sex was good. don't get me wrong, it was, but that was even more mortifying than being in the stirrups, naked from the waist down, having my professor look at my vagina. 

he finds the tampon after 5 long, agonizing minutes of searching. i have his class in a few days. not sure how i'm going to look at him. i'm a 4.0 student and i've never felt more stupid in my entire life. 

tl;dr: forgot i had a tampon in and had sex, losing the tampon. had to go to the health center to get it removed by my professor, who is also the campus physician. 

edit: i was dumb enough to say ""stupider"" instead of more stupid, as many of you have pointed out. its been a long day, ya'll. 
 
edit 2: turns out ""stupider"" was fine. lesson learned: those terms are interchangeable, trust your gut. also, take your tampon out before sex. 

edit 3: wow, i didnt really expect this post to blow up like it did. thanks for making a story about my vagina make the front page, guys. 
for those of you asking, it ended up near my cervix. it was too small/deep for me to have much success getting it myself, because when you lean forward to do a self-exam, the vaginal canal tightens. 
thanks for the supportive messages, i didn't realize this was such a common problem. makes me feel a lot better, lol. ",4
"by thinking i had a family history of glaucoma after finding my dad's weed 17 years ago. tldr at the bottom

17 years ago i passed my driver's test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. being a huge nerd i checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when i found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. i just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. i handed it to him, said i didn't care who it belonged to but if i ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. he just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, ""it's your mom's for her glaucoma"". whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.

&#x200b;

i was at a family a dinner awhile ago and i can't remember what someone said but i replied with, ""yeah, because mom has glaucoma"" and my mom goes, ""i don't have glaucoma"" and i, incredulously, said ""dad said you had glaucoma"", in which my dad responds to with, ""what the hell are you talking about, i never said that"". after reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe i believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. i told them i had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit i'd been on for the past like 15 years. they just laughed harder.

"by hiding in my girlfriend's room while her parents are home. as the title says, i am currently fucking up by being in my girlfriend's room. 

you may be thinking she's here with me, scared to be caught, but she's not. in fact she's nowhere near me, because she's at school.

my girlfriend and i live about an hour away from each other and she has school so you can imagine seeing each other is not the easier thing right away. my girlfriend also lives with her parents, and she's asian, meaning no boyfriend until college (though her mom seems okay with it).

on wednesday we developed a plan to have me sleepover her house without getting caught. the plan was simple, i would come when her parents were gone at work (they own a restaurant) and i would leave in the morning when her dad takes her to school because her mom would still be sleeping.

it went great, i made it out, even ran to my car which wasn't necessary because by the time her dad was coming back i was driving out of her neighbourhood. 

fast forward to that night and i end up going back over. thursday goes good, i go to her room in the morning and end up going back to sleep until she comes home. 

now it's friday morning. her dad almost caught us because he wanted to take the recycling out but she quickly got it for him. then she leaves, i lock her bedroom door and settle in her bed where i'll be for the next 7 hours waiting for her to come back. 

her dad comes back, comes upstairs, tries to open the door. fuck. it's locked. he pauses, turns the light on, i assume he looks in her brother's room, then tries the door again. still locked for obvious reasons he does not know about. he says something to himself (i don't speak chinese but i really wish i did), then goes back downstairs where he sleeps on the couch.

i text girlfriend, almost dying because of how scared i am to get caught. she tells me to chill, tells me they don't have keys to their doors, the only way to open it is to take the handle off. she texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. her dad doesn't always listen so that worries me.

pretty sure her dad went back to sleep now, and her mom isn't awake. now i'm currently laying in her bed wide awake, texting her, asking my parents what to do (have had similar experiences and got caught), and trying not to freak the fuck out because i can't do anything.

escaping is impossible. her window has blinds and a screen and is second story. going downstairs and out the door is foolish, her dad sleeps on the couch and the stairs are noisy. plus i have no idea what time her mom wakes up.

i have no choice but to sit it out for the next 7 hours, maybe try to get some rest but i doubt i will. anyone have any advice? she's 19, i'm 20, her parents don't even know she has a boyfriend.

i imagine they'll be beyond pissed if they find out i'm here, we'll both be fucked. not only is she dating me but i'm staying in her house without them knowing. it's scary to think there could be someone in your house and you wouldn't even know it, i feel bad for doing this but i love my girlfriend and i'm literal melted butter in her hands.

update: probably should have gotten up with her right away but chose to stay in bed... now i have to poop really badly. about 6 more hours to go though. rip my bowels and my asshole. also for some reason everything in her house fucking creaks, so i have to be very careful with what i do on the bed, sleeping position wise.

update 09:54 am, about 5 more hours: i still have to poop, not as badly though. however a new probably has arose. i grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of hawaiian bread. i ate the egg obviously because i can't really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. tummy feels a bit weird. hope i don't throw up because it's very hard to be silent while your guts spill on the floor. also think of napping but too afraid i'll let out a massive fart or make some noise. girlfriend stopped replying due to class. i've given up the idea of escaping a long while ago. the dad is of no concern, pretty mid level threat but low for now. mom is high level once she wakes up though. hopefully she'll leave for work but it looks like that might not happen as she isn't awake yet and supposedly would leave at 10:30. 

quick update 09:55am: mom is awake and went downstairs, i think she'll make breakfast or something. dad is talking to mom, don't know what about. hope they don't try the door again, really feel like i'm gonna shit and throw up now.

good update 10:03 am: good news, pretty sure the mom just left, pretty sure i can hear her dad snoring. i can finally relax a little. might actually catch some shut eye. off to play a bit of fifa mobile and then maybe sleep for a few hours.

okay another update since it was asked for: 10:20 am, mom's long gone for sure, dad's asleep, not snoring but i'm pretty sure he's sleeping. unfortunately girlfriend hasn't answered texts for the last two hours i think. finally beat a team in fifa after playing them for the 20th time. every time the air conditioner turns on it makes this loud ass noise so every time that happens i get spooked. i'm glad everyone is getting a good laugh out of it. someone thought this post was fake, which is fine. not really sure how to prove it's real. as i said before hiding under the bed is impossible, the only place to hide is her closet which will be a tight squeeze. hoping it doesn't come to that. dad will probably sleep all day, as he stays up all night talking to his friends in china so his body is in another time zone. might just nap when the girlfriend comes home as she usually naps after class. thanks for the good luck. see you in an hour or when something interesting happens. 

updated 11:40 am: hello, my girlfriend knows this exists now so hello, enjoy my pain and these comments. so far dad's still asleep, mom is at work, ac still spooks me. here's some answers to questions: gf's birthday is late, yes dad works but ""he can't handle work"" so he goes later (around 6 i think?), and i'll make it clear now i'm not planning to escape, it would be stupid. i truly think gf's dad doesn't care enough to try and bust down the door. also yes, florida is a stand your ground are but dad doesn't own guns, just knives (i feel like i could run faster, used to play soccer and have been practicing boxing for years and more recently muay thai so i know how to run and fight). to those asking for proof, if you tell me how to upload a pic then i'd have no problem doing that. as for my poop situation, i still have to go but it's not that bad anymore. yes i have a bit or orange and bread left, and i have headphones that are supplying me with some nice spotify service. also, i played campaign mode in fifa, finally beat chapter 2 after 3 days. see you in an hour. 

not really an update but i'll post link to gf and i'd texts and her room door (had to reupload bc her face was exposed) proof reddit(https://imgur.com/gallery/9pv91je) 

update again: uhhhhh i didn't see a post that got deleted. i deleted the link to the pic bc it had her face in it, but i uploaded a new pic and posted the link up above. if this shit is deleted then uhhhh what the fuck reddit you wanna fight? as for my bowels, still gotta go but not as badly. i'm probably going to watch some youtube or netflix, since sleeping isn't a good idea. i'll update in an hour as always. 

update: try using your phone to view. anyway good news. as we speak i am shitting in the toilet. dad left. pooping has never felt so good. i'll update you when my girlfriend comes back.

update: girlfriend is home, i pooped as soon as the dad left. yes i know it's stupid staying longer but now that my girlfriend is home i'm safe. for those who are asking why didn't i leave when i got the food, there was a very tiny window to do things, and i didn't have my bag packed. there will be one more update after this when i get home, the true safe zone. as for now the girlfriend and i are going to play fifa and chill until i have to leave. 

final update: hello i am at my house in bed, nowhere near my girlfriend's parents. i have pooped twice, it went well thank you for asking. about my girlfriend's age,,, she went to school in china at first, and has a late birthday, therefore she's making up credits and will be going to actual uni soon. she's not finished university and gotten a degree, therefore, no boyfriend. for those of you saying she's an adult her parents don't control her... they do. as long as she lives there and they support her financially. not to mention she isn't white... she's asian (chinese specifically). i myself am italian/cuban, so the same rules go for me until i move out (planning to before the end of next year).  many of you ask why i didn't leave when her dad left to pick her up, instead pooping. first off i had to poop so badly. secondly i won't see her for awhile, and recently she got hurt so i've been helping tend to her wounds so she doesn't need to go to the hospital (mom's a nurse, taught me everything since i was young). i wanted to be there for her in person. also yes, her parents own a restaurant. i won't post anymore updates (99.9% chance i won't bc it's over) but will reply to dm's and replies :)

final permanent update: yes it's about almost a year later, she broke up with me a few months ago. i'm glad you all enjoyed my pain lmao just wanted to write this just in case anyone comes back to read this and is wondering what happened almost a year later. i'm currently happy, perhaps have a bit of a thing going on with a different girl, i'm mentally and physically better than when i did this stupid shit. i will never do this again, and i don't suggest anyone else does it, i had about 5 heart attacks throughout the whole thing and it was a shitty thing to do, if i was the dad and found out i would be beyond pissed. sorry mr.ex's dad. yeah, i hope everyone is doing well, i'm doing better, enjoy your day/night :)



tldr: currently staying in my girlfriend's room while her parents are home, doors locked, dad tried to get in, parents don't even know i exist, no escape route. also have to shit really badly.",4
"by missing my own graduation. i was supposed to graduate with my masters degree and had invited my whole family to attend my graduation. the only problem was that i told them all that my graduation was on sunday because i actually thought it was on sunday. people booked tickets, and cousins were coming from all over america. 

this morning i wake up at 11:30 and was casually seeing my instagram stories to see everyone in robes. my official school account also was posting about people graduating today. so i went back to the email they sent a few weeks ago on the graduation dates -- turns out i missed graduation. i'm still lying in bed calculating the magnitude of my stupidity. i don't even know what i'm going to tell everyone in my family who's going to come down to ""see me walk"". i missed my own graduation!! 

tl;dr: thought i was graduating on sunday but the graduation was today.

edit: just found out there is also individual department ceremonies at the university of florida. i missed the university-wide ceremony but i can still go to the engineering department ceremony on monday!!!

thank you u/ifntchingyu",4
"by trying to edit a headshot without permission, hr is involved.. tl;dr at bottom.

i work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. a portion of what i do is handling the corporate website. one of our mid-level professionals (i'll call her gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. it's a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.

every year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. it's one guy who does every office, and he's usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he'll do colour correction, but no retouching.

so, gina's paper is being published, and i'm called on to do all the marketing around it. this includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.

the thing is, gina's headshot is a little... off.

as a thumbnail, it's fine, but when it's zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. not a little ""maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch"" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you'd expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.

so, i can't exactly call up and ask if i should do something about this, as it's not really a conversation i want to have, and i'm also not known as the most tactful person. i'm very familiar with photoshop, and use it all the time (i've got no graphic design qualifications though, so i'm very slow by comparison), so i go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. i'm zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.

i work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. still, it's not something i want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, i alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.

lo and behold, gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she's marked up. as she comes by, i hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. she comes in and freezes, asks what i'm doing. i say im just tweaking a picture, and when i look at my own screen, it's zoomed right in on her cleavage.

she gets louder and asks what the fuck i'm doing fixing her chest area. she then asks if i'm making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. for some reason, i decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say i'm evening out the skin tone.

she dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.

about an hour later, i get an email from hr saying that i need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  i ask if i can speak privately first, and explain the situation. i still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it's sexist to try and ""make her prettier"". i acknowledge that, but also mention that i tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, i'm just trying to get out of the awkwardness. 

we have the meeting, and i had to explain the whole thing to gina directly. she is adamant that she doesn't have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn't. she's sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). she then goes on to suggest that i altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn't dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).

i then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the hr rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.

she's still livid, and hr suggest that i should jump off this project. 

i'm actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. i told my boss the whole story and he's assured me i'll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.

tl:dr: tried to edit a moustache out of a female colleague's professional headshot, didn't want to embarrass her by letting other people see, she walks by and i reflexively scroll down to hide the mouth and it looks like i'm zoomed in on her breasts. ",4
"by unwrapping a condom. so this happened earlier in the week but is nsfw so posting on the weekend. also on my throwaway acc. since i don't want this story going back to the irl me.

so at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our ""welcome to uni"" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. i'd always chucked these in my drawer for ""future use"" if the situation requiring them ever arose. it never has and so i took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.

anyway, i'm on intersemester break right now so i (19m) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. i decided i'd open the wrapper since i'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and i thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.

as i discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason i took a smell since i could kind of tell it smelt weird.

when i did this, i realised that i had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. i have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when i was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. except now i realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. i felt pretty sick then.

i wish i could delete memories and that i'd never remembered/realised this.

tl;dr  got out a condom to try it out, realised i've tasted condoms before.

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. i have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it's definitely not catholic. i think it's something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.

i think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that ""pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc."" i'm also from new zealand, not north america as a few have assumed. here it's taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me ""the talk"" either.

the ""balloon"" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.

thank you for the awards, i wish they could make me forget, at least there is a small positive now from fake internet points.",4
"tifu by loudly telling a female workmate i was going to finger her. so i (m 22) work in a factory that is slightly short staffed, so from time to time some of the office staff have to come through to the factory and help out. one of these office workers is a (f 18) who we'll call jess. so jess was in the factory helping out and i happened to walk past her wearing some rubber gloves. now jess and i have a friendly bit of banter from time to time, and so as i was passing her she looked at my gloves and said 

""you look like you're about to go finger a cow""
(which is a bit of a weird thing to say, but hey ho) 

so me being the master of wit that i am instantly thought ""right, now's my time to shine! if i say the right thing i could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow""
my brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was

""i'll finger you""

not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
because of the level of noise i  the factory i have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. it just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
at this point i wanted to just crawl into a hole, but i stood my ground and tried explaining myself

""i meant that as though you're a cow, not that i actually want to finger you""

this seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
i can't look jess in the eye any more. works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

tl/dr:  female workmate said i looked like i was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response i said ""i'll finger you."" now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references

edit: my first silver and gold! i'm glad my fuck up was able to entertain you all a little 😂 thank you, internet strangers!

edit 2: holy shit,  platinum?? anonymous platinum giver, if you were a cow i would definitely finger you😂",4
"by trusting some rando on airbnb. shit river 2k19

we have a thousand words to explain all that transpired with our dear friend paul from august 3rd to august 4th, 2019. let me spin you a tale...a tale of shit river.

4:30 pm

our initial impressions of the house were terrific! our illustrious host, paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. paul was friendly! check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. everything was looking great!

6:00 pm

we return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. we fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. we had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! a few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.

8:15 pm

after a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. we discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). plunging half successfully, we messaged paul and let him know the situation. only one working toilet isn't ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we'd make it work!

8:38 pm

the remaining toilet won't flush. the party grows worried. paul assures us that he will call a plumber.

9:00 pm

paul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won't be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. a five second google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in virginia beach, but paul did not want to call them. after ""informing"" our dear friend paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. a plumber was found! magic!

9:30 pm

raw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. the house likely possessed. drinks have been drunk like it's the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or uber to safety. after all, where would we go? we pray to whatever eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.

10:01 pm

the stench. dear god. the stench.

11:20 pm

emergency plumber arrives with paul and paul's friend in tow. one of them goes to the roof. one of them pounds a pabst blue ribbon. advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. we split the party.

12:20 am

plumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for ""the final blasting."" paul's friend fails to discover how to ""switch off his nose"" and taps out (""i'm out man, i'm out.""). it's been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. the backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *for now.*

12:22 am

paul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. classic paul! we oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.

12:24 am

the final blasting. the stench. the horror. the splatter. we all take 2d6 damage.

1:00 am

paul & co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. he requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. we decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. we also decide to leave the next morning.

2:00 am: the witching hour

lights flicker ominously. the house isn't finished with us yet…

4:30 am

paul offers a full refund (excellent). he later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). we ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. he offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).

10:30 am

the party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. we take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the toilet gods.

11:10 am

we commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. after completion, we agree never to speak of this again. who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?

11:11 am

the great gurgle. we hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. was it the broken spirit of paul's friend chugging another pbr? nope. the shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.

11:15 am

we hasten our efforts to flee. paul is called. we finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.

11:30 am

we convene to discuss departure. suddenly, one of our party realizes we've been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping shit river pooling in the hallway. fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the rubicon. we form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.

11:32 am

water oozes up from the baseboards. satan's septic tank thirsts for blood. the lights flicker once more.

11: 35 am

our dearest friend paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: ""this house is fucked."" agreeing with paul's uncanny observation, we flee the house. the smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.

"by applying for engineering jobs and telling employers i'm retarded. so this has been going on since i graduated in may and started applying for jobs. i've submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and i have not had much feedback. well the vast majority of these jobs have you check boxes with disabilities you may have and since i have adhd, i have been checking the box marked ""intellectual disability"" all these months. 


so about fifteen minutes ago i'm going through an application like normal and i get to the part where they ask about disabilities. this is what it reads: ""intellectual disability (formerly described as mental retardation)"". i feel sick to my stomach knowing that i've been applying for jobs that i really want and i have unknowingly classified myself as mentally retarded. i don't deserve these jobs for being so dumb and fucking up all these applications.


tldr: i've been checking the ""intellectual disability"" in applications to declare adhd when that actual means mental retardation. i've fucked up over a hundred job applications.",4
"by accidentally putting mentos and diet coke in my mouth at the same time in a foreign country. being half japanese, i take a trip to japan every two years with my dad to visit relatives, sightseeing etc. unfortunately i was never actually taught japanese so having my dad there with me is super useful when i need assistance. on our trips my dad usually takes a day to go hangout with his old friends (we live in the us) and usually leaves me at our hotel or whatever. today was one of those days. while laying in bed watching pewdiepie's minecraft videos i got quite hungry and thought to myself ""i can go down to the convenience store and get some snacks by myself right?"" normally, yes. so i take a couple thousand yen that my dad left me and walk to the nearest family mart (for those of you who don't know it's a japanese convenience store.) i browse the shelves a bit and up buying a bento meal, mentos, and a diet coke. checking out goes fine since i don't really need to communicate, just hand over money. so as i walk back to my hotel in the middle of a crowded sidewalk my dumbass decided to pop a few mentos in my mouth just because. so i suck on those for a while and than without even thinking about the consequences i take a huge swig of diet coke, like so big that i can't swallow all of it and it's just sitting in my mouth. than all of a sudden so feel a very weird foaming in my mouth. than it hits me. i remember the experiments i did in elementary school, the crazy russian hacker vids, etc. that was the very moment i knew i fucked up. so before i can think literally anything else it's foaming out of my mouth and i choke a little and end up just spewing out this diet coke foam. so obviously the people around me notice and come up to me and start speaking japanese. and of course i am sitting there, completely clueless. they were probably asking me if i needed help? i am dying of sheer embarrassment so i deadass just bolt back to my hotel with foam dripping down my face and clothes, im feeling sticky everywhere and life is not good. once i get back to my hotel room and start to settle in i remember that i left my actual food on the sidewalk. so i just ended up starving until my dad came home and brought some leftovers.

"by putting my dick in a year old fleshlight. i bought a fleshlight back in february of 2018, using it on and off again for about 3 months until i decided to box it up for good. i had had enough of the joy the toy brought me, and had just started a relationship with my now lovely girlfriend.

flash forward to yesterday, when i was looking through my old junk. i was bored and decided to do some (late) spring cleaning, when i came upon the box. i smirked and opened up the box to see my prized possession, the fleshlight. i put it aside for today, when i decided to use it. out of lube, i went it dry, fuck up #1. once i reached as far in as my lil member would let me in it, i felt a tickling sensation. uneased i pulled out fast, giving my dick a rug burn type sensation. to my surprise, and disgust, i was met with a spider on the tip of my dick. without thinking, i instantly flicked it off with my long ass fingernails, scraping the tip of my dick. in pain, i freaked out and let the spider get away.

my dick now hurts, and a spider is now loose in my house.

"(nsfw) by forgetting that my boyfriend creampied me last night and going to my gynecologist's appointment.. before everyone freaks out - yes, i am on birth control. also, apologies on format because of mobile blah blah.

this happened 30 minutes ago. i'm currently sitting in my car outside my gynecologist's office typing this.

my boyfriend and i both lead pretty busy lives. he works full time and often works overnight shifts. on the other hand, i'm a full time student that works 30-35 hours a week. on top of that, i had to put down my beloved fur child last saturday, so as expected, he hasn't really been putting his wand in my chamber of secrets..if you catch my drift.

after an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in conan o'brien's words, ""take grandma to applebee's."" it's been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. as in, i felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. when i was cleaning myself up after, i noticed just how much was coming out of me and when i told him he laughs it off and says,"" haha, yeah, that was a lot.""

anyways, this morning i check my calendar and of course i have a gyno appointment. i'm the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, i completely forget about last nights sexscapade. 

fast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. i guess my gyno was training a physician's assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. 

for the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner sasha grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists' viewing pleasure. they then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. ya know, nothing's better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified vag while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.

anyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. my experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions (keep in mind that he was not behind her but was to my left). midway he stops, walks over to take a quick look, smirks, and goes,"" do you finally have a bf?"" (it's worth noting that he's a really cool gyno and obviously, i must talk to him about my sex life every check up; at this point, i wasn't sure if he had actually seen the semen inside me or was just making small talk). i awkwardly answer ""yes"" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. the new pa still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. that's the exact moment that my soul leaves my body. as she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, i see my boyfriend's freaking baby batter dripping off this thing into the floor. once the speculum was removed, i proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. yes, i was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. 

the poor pa looks at my gyno and asks,"" did you want me to clean that?,"" referring to what dripped on the floor. before he could answer, i made a strange ass sound and rushed out,"" it's okay, i'll do it.""

before they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,"" guess your dry spell is finally over!"" we speak casually like friends so i'm not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.

guys.. i am seriously fucking horrified. what the fuck. i'm seriously considering switching gyno's but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. 

also, not using a throwaway because i have no shame.

tl;dr: boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me.

edit: for those of you suggesting that this is an april fools joke.. it is unfortunately not. my dignity is in shambles but i'm glad a few of you were able to laugh, cry, and cringe with me.

also, yes, i did shower. my after-sex routine always involves a shower where i proceed to push my pelvic floor muscles like i am a reborn christian, trying to expel the demon spawn that my sinful boyfriend had pushed into me. although a hefty amount did come out last night, apparently, not all of it. contrary to popular belief, cooter's are not wide, gaping holes, with lips that flap whenever there's a breeze. washing the outside of your vagina does not clean the inside which, if you're not dipping your 'nana into the nutella jar, is where the semen goes. a pap smear looks at the inside of the vagina and a speculum is an instrument that basically spreads open the walls of your tight vagina so the gynecologist can get a better look at your cervix.

in my case, just like ~~noah~~ moses, that speculum split the waves and onto the path that was just formed, onward gushed my beloved boyfriend's high fructose porn syrup. 

edit 2: for those that don't believe this is true.. or that i am female (grrls don't use the the interwebz hurrhurr), here are the screenshots of me talking to my boyfriend after.

edit 3: for those that still don't believe me:

https://imgur.com/a/ymzjvjk

also, please don't speak badly about my gynecologist. you may think it's unprofessional but i've been seeing him for years now (prior to my bf, i was single for 3 years and i'm not one to partake in one night stands) and we're really close. as part of a regular check up for std screening, he always asked if i have engaged in any sexual activity and for three years, i'd say no then tell him how much i longed for a relationship. if this happened in one of our first appointments, he would have never acted like this. i have pcos/am high risk for cervical cancer so i am constantly there for testing, ultrasounds, and general check ups regarding birth control/metformin/etc. (we're still working on a method to regulate my period). he's become really close to me and we always joke around because it eases my nerves. it took us a while to get as comfortable as we are with each other and i wouldn't change it for the world. though it'll always be nerve wracking to see any kind of physician especially a gynecologist, for me, it really helps that i view him as a friend. 

to clarify, bf and i had sex around 3am last night, i cleaned up, then we went to bed. today (or i guess yesterday since it's 12:33am right now), was my day off so i legitimately woke up and netflixed in bed all day until around 1 pm since my appointment was at 2.

believe me or not, that's up to you. all i'm saying is i swear on my beloved fur baby's soul that it happened and i am still super embarrassed. in the years that i've been his patient, i have never seen this young female pa before. i do not know if this was the first time she encountered a situation like this but from the look on her face, i can only guess. i'm sure she'll become seasoned in time and things like this wil not phase her. the pa gave me my pap smear and i had to come back in a week to get an ultrasound for my pcos anyway so if results were unclear due to semen, i'm sure we will redo the pap smear. my appointment was at 2pm but i was not seen until 3pm due to him having an emergency regarding a patient to attend to at the hospital so the exam was very rushed since he had a full waiting room. however, i'll be sure not to have piv sex for at least 48 hours prior (very thankful for this advice as i genuinely did not know and this was my first visit where i am in a relationship ever).

i honestly was not expecting this to blow up like this in anyway.. i never even really post on reddit, hence not using a throwaway since nobody knows i have this account *shrugs*. i guess this will become my ""throwaway"" account now since all this attention is making me a bit uncomfortable.

some of you are criticizing my writing style and that's okay. i decided to have some fun with this post since it honestly was an awkward situation. i also happen to be a fan of euphemisms and personally challenged myself to use as many as i could. sorry to those that felt it was hard to read or cringey and thanks to those that light heartedly laughed with me. i appreciate all of you - both the bad and good comments.

it was nice feeling semi-popular for one day, as things have been pretty gloomy around here ever since my dog died but some of your comments have really brightened my day. 

goodnight reddit!",4
"by turning my grandpa into a weeaboo.. my grandma died last year and grandpa's tken it hard. now he used to be the dirty old man sort of guy, so i thought getting him nekopara vol. 0 (a visual novel about catgirls) for christmas would be nice.

a few days ago, we met up at a wedding. i see my grandpa. he starts excitedly chatting with me about the game and i think, ""i did a good thing"" and tuned out the rambling.

i shouldn't have. we go back to my grandpa's place.

grandpa: here are the new decorations i have!

mom: dad, what is all this?

grandpa: stuff from the game your magnificent son gave me!

the whole apartment was littered with nekopara figurines, posters, merch and etc. he had a body pillow in his bedroom. now my family looks down on me for converting my grandpa into the weebiest of weebs.

i learned today through text he picked up eromanga sensei. god help his soul.

tl;dr: i gave my grandad a copy of nekopara. he went ape-shit and bought merch. my family now hates me for converting him into a degenerate.

"by sending a picture of the engagement ring to my girlfriend. tl;dr: accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.

&nbsp;

  so this was actually a few months ago. i (24m) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24f). i was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. 

&nbsp;

  so i put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. welp, it was immediately after clicking send that i noticed the texts in the thread didn't look right. i looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: it was my gf. ""shit"" i said over the phone. my friend asked what was wrong, and i told him i'd have to call him back. tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.

&nbsp;

  as a last ditch effort, i called her, as the message did not yet say ""delivered"". she answered the phone and i immediately said ""do you see the message i just sent?"" ""yeah...it says attachment, why?"" immediately i blurted ""dont open it! just delete the thread. please."" 

&nbsp;

  she sounded concerned, and asked ""is this something i should be worried about? you're kinda scaring me lol"". ""no, no,"" i said, ""i just have a little surprise for you i was trying to show someone and don't want to ruin the surprise."" she relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. ""ok, i deleted it. didn't look at it."" i know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but i can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. the 1 or 2 times i ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. it's just not in her to lie, and she's honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).

&nbsp;

  so i had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now i had her highly suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. so i immediately went and found a cute little necklace on etsy i knew she'd like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. later that week she got it and texted me, saying i was very sweet and she loved my surprise. phew. a few weeks later i actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected i was going to propose. despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her ""girls' day"" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.

&nbsp;

  when i told her about what that text really was and how i covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. she was impressed with how i improvised and threw her off track lol. we're getting married next october :)

"by having, what is hopefully, the strangest sexual experience i encounter. nsfw. literally happened a half hour ago.

husband and i have been together 15 years.  we are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven't done and we love it all.  nothing is gross or weird with us when we're getting off.

he asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  i did.  unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  it was about the size of a quarter but he's tough and didn't complain.

i walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  he's not home 90% of the year because of work so i, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  i thought ""i'll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls"".  

he's loving it.  i'm loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.

i feel something as i'm making circles with my tongue.  no big deal whether it's hair or lint whatever so i quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  as i pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) i glance at it.  it's grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  it took a half a second to realize that i had literally sucked the scab off my husband's balls.  

tl;dr - exfoliated husband's balls with my mouth.",4
"when my best mate changed his name in my phone to ""sexy jess from work"". so several years ago my best mate todd changed his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" and then would ring my phone in the middle of the niggt to try and get me in trouble with my partner. but she was friends with him before we had even gotten together so she recognized his number and his prank didnt really  work out.

fast forward 6 or 7 years to the weekend just passed.
im sitting on the couch watching tv and my partner is upstairs my 8 year old daughter is bored so i give her my phone to play a game on.

que fuck up.
i never changed todds name back. its been a running joke between us for years.
so ""sexy jess from work"" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. she freaks out. comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams ""i hate you dad!"". she runs off upstairs.
so im sitting there really confused. after a few seconds i follow her upstairs. i can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.
now im really confused. i get to the bedroom. my partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from ""sexy jess from work"". i piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.

tldr : buddy saved his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" several years ago as a joke. today my daughter sees it freaks out and thinks im cheating on hwr mother.

sorry for formatting on mobile.


edit. wow this blew up.

so yes my daughter threw my phone at me. then picked it up and took it with her upstairs.

im australian. my daughter is in grade 4 and is quite intelligent. yes she knows what sexy is and yes she knows what cheating is.

"by laughing at my son while he was saying his prayers. so, my 6 year old often likes to make up his own prayers at night time and it's adorable.  

so,  tonight,  he was kneeling at his bed in his jammies looking so cute i could just eat him.  


him: ""dear lord jesus, please watch over me as i sleep tonight. please look over mommy and daddy and teachers and friends too and the friends i haven't met yet. 

thank you for dinner and inventing minecraft ...""

*i chuckle lightly*

him: *turning to me angrily* ""it's not funny!!""

me: ""i'm sorry sweetie, i won't do it again""

him: *resuming his prayer* ""and please don't let my toys come alive tonight. amen""

and he hopped into bed. 

my stifled laugh sounded like a loud pig snorting, so i just layed my face down in his blankets and pretended like i was praying deeply as i tried to compose my self. 

then i got up quickly trying to hide my face, and i sneaked one last look to say good night as i shut the door and he was giving me the death glare. 



edit: thank you so much for the likes, comments,  gold and silver!  i really didn't think it was going to make it to the front page ! 

i actually thought it was going to get removed or downvoted because of our religion! i didn't realize so  many people have such hate towards people who believe in a higher power! 😥 it convinces me to keep teaching my son to love and to show respect to everyone no matter what they believe in. 

 i had a lot of fun reading everyone's comments.  they were very funny.  i am very thankful!😊😊

this is the cute little guy with his mama!

"by putting a 5 hour energy in my vagina. 12 hours before my first ""grown up job"" interview, i was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company's grounds. considering i smoke weed daily i started looking up ways to pass a drug test. i came to the conclusion that i was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. i had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they're just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. 

unfortunately i was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time i had to prepare, but knowing that i wouldn't be able to pass if the temperature wasn't correct i had the idea to stick it up my vagina. i tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so i could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.

fast forward to the interview.
it was an hour and a half away so i decided to wait till i got there to insert it. i did it in my car w some coconut oil before i walked in just incase they decided to drug test me first. i walked in and everything was fine, i signed in and they told me to take a seat. as soon as i sat down i knew something was wrong. i went to the bathroom to make sure i could still take it out. i began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn't move. i tugged again and the string broke. at this point i'm freaking out. i try getting it out with my fingers but i can't reach it. the only ""tools"" i have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. so in a 3 piece suit and heels, i squat and begin to use these ""tools"" to try and remove the bottle. about 4 min go by and i'm really freaking out but need to go back incase they called my name. i walk out and the hr rep sees me and asks if i'm okay. i tell her i have a tampon stuck up my vagina that i can't get out and that's why i'm freaking out. she then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, i ask her if i can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. obviously that didn't work. so she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... still didn't work. at this point i just have to do the interview. it lasted 3 hours and i had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. 

when the interview finally ends i rush to the closest urgent care where i have to explain to the doctors why there's a 5 hour energy in my vagina. at this point i'm convinced i just don't have the right tools and they'll get it out in no time. upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it's also sideways. her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle in my vagina and then fish it out. ~luckily~ they just sent me to the er instead. 

so now i'm at the er where they then inform me that since it's behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since i wasn't actually giving birth my body wasn't dilated and they couldn't remove the bottle without putting me under.  

well, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.
i didn't get the job and i didn't even get drug tested. 

tldr: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. after 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the er it was finally removed

edit: this isn't made up. idk if i have all the ""anatomy"" right i guess? yes it was very painful. yes, i have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don't believe me

i'm just telling you guys what the doctors told me. they might have just told me a dumbed down version without the right medicinal terminology, idk

"by trying to remember what a customer looked like. the time has come. i've made it. i'm writing this from the break room shaking and humiliated. not only did this fu happen today, it happened within the last hour. i don't see my therapist again until friday, so you get to hear about it instead.

i work in a customer-facing position in a small office. today's just a regular monday. talking to customers, preparing their work orders, finishing their paperwork, all sorts of small stuff. at time being, i have three customers sitting in my waiting area.

the most recent addition to our quiet morning waiting room, we'll call her jan, has been here before. or rather, her family has a customer history with us - it's my first time meeting her. the name on their account is hank junts and i feel like i've met him before. i *know* that i've met him before. i browse through their history and they have extensive records, but for the life of me i cannot place his face.

after about ten minutes of idle clicking, i decide to search his name on google with the name of our city.

>""beloved softball coach hank junts passes away in tragic fire."" 

headline from a local news station.

*oh my god. maybe that's why i've never met her before. maybe he always came in instead of her.*

the article is dated december of last year.

*jeeze, it probably has been that long since i've seen him, hasn't it. oh how tragic.* jan is probably only in her 40s or so. 

i wonder if i should say anything.

but i don't have to say anything. i would credit satan with the creation of auto-play videos on news articles, but satan never did anything so heinous.

**in tragic news, hank junts, softball coach at smith middle school, passed away as a result of a house fire last night.**

at full volume - echoing through the small room like a bird that got trapped inside, bouncing and flitting around uncatchable. i cannot catch it. the bird has knocked a vase onto mrs. junts' head. the bird has knocked me on my ass. there is a bird in my throat and it feels like my mouth is full of feathers.

*oh my god oh my god oh my god.*

**no no no.**

i frantically scroll trying to find the video player. fuck. found it. pause pause pause pause pause you piece of shit.

*oh yeah, that's what he looks like.*

jan looks up at me. i look up at jan. the earth crackles and groans as the floor beneath me opens and swallows me whole.

no, i'm not that lucky. i stammer something about being so sorry for her loss and run to the break room, where i now sit red-faced and horrified. i can hear her on her cell phone. she is crying. i am crying. i fucked up and just ruined my customer's day and have a new addition to the file of horrible things to think about right as i fall asleep.

tldr: couldn't remember what a customer looked like, wound up with a news clip loudly autoplaying how the customer died in a house fire - and i played it all of ten feet from his widow.

edit: okay i hate edits but now i understand why people do them. our faq of the day - no, my keyboard unfortunately does not have a volume button and i do try to keep my computer on mute. for what it's worth (i.e. not much at this fuckin point), the only reason it wasn't muted was because i was showing someone a coworker a video while we were opening. and yes, i probably shouldn't have done that either. 

there's a lot of love/hate about the bird thing. thank you for the compliments. if you said something mean i hope a real life non-metaphorical bird poops right on your head.

as far as what i'm going to do next. mrs. junts is coming back into the office next monday so i'm planning on talking to her in person then. thankfully i have a some days to practice because tbh, even though logically i know it was an innocent mistake, it still feels awful and it's hard to think about facing her. my coworker said she seemed okay when she left. and yes, i know that it was probably a mistake to run away but if i had any good judgement about any of this i wouldn't have a reason to post here in the first place.

so when all this went down, my sister and i asked my mom to take a dna test as well. she agreed. as it turns out, my mom is not my biological mom. as i said before, it makes no difference to me because my mom is my mom no matter what. 

here is the kicker though

my mom was wholeheartedly under the impression her eggs were used in her ivf treatment. she is contacting her doctor who is still in practice to figure out what the hell this means. 

i'm actually sort of sad for my mom, i didn't consider this as an option in the realm of possibility. we are her daughters of course but i can't imagine finding out at her age with adult kids that your biological line actually ends with you. 

so yeah, guess that's all i have for now!

tldr; mom is not my mom and she is more shocked than i am. 

edit: i talked to my mom this morning and she's ok, thank goodness. she said we're still her babies! i discussed the idea of hiring a lawyer with her, she said she still has her ivf paperwork somewhere so she is looking for it. her paper hoarding may come in handy this once! i'm just happy she is alright.",4
"by teaching my daughter to talk. actually happened yesterday. the effects are still rampant this morning.  

grocery shopping with my one year old girl. she's just the sweetest. really loves cooking and shopping with her daddy. is chatty with anyone that will talk to her and waves at literally everyone. 

so of course we've been teaching her to say every day words as well as any new ones we think she can pick up on. she's getting quite the vocabulary for being so little. 

as it goes i decided to grill some chicken and have a nice garden salad for dinner with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. i took my little angel to the store with me to grab a few things and when i picked up the balsamic vinegar, i heard a familiar question:

*what's that?* 

i told her it was balsamic vinegar, which she pronounced ""ba salty n-word"" i tried to correct her to no avail. her decision was concrete.  

my adorable little girl is passing out n-words. i'm mortified. she's loudly and proudly saying her new words.

we scurried out with no groceries/people staring and ordered pizza for dinner. she's still asking this morning when we're going to eat ba salty n-word.

tl;dr tried to teach my one year old to say ""balsamic vinegar"" she is now saying ""ba salty n-word"" with reckless abandon.

edit: her 4 year old brother is now saying it too. one guess who is staying home from pre school today.

edit2: some people are asking about how she's speaking so well at a year. she's actually 13 months old but i detest giving her age in months now that she's reached a year. 

she talks constantly, asks for things, says please and thank you, knows names for specific toys and items. asks for specific things to eat. knows all of our names in our immediate family and grandparents. 

the how is we taught her to speak along with asl (american sign language), so before she could speak she could ask for milk, or more, or to be changed and a few other things before she was able to vocalize her needs. it's the best parenting thing we've ever done.

edit3: i'm really enjoying reading all the stories of other kids mixing up words. this post will definitely be saved as a gift for her 21st.

last edit: i'm pretty sick of some people saying my daughter can't talk, and that kids don't speak until 18mo-2years. here's a small article(https://www.babycenter.com/404_when-can-i-start-teaching-my-baby-sign-language_1368485.bc)  with 5 sources advocating asl for babies. it helped her develop her spoken words more easily. don't be a dick about my kid you fucking don't know it all shitbags.",4
"by letting my nephew use my deceased brother cell phone. this happened yesterday. my brother passed away in an accident a few months ago, he was only 35. needless to say, it was - and still is - a huge trauma to all of us. my 6 years old nephew wanted to play a game in my brother´s (his father) phone, sister-in-law was ok with it, so i let him. all of the sudden, i hear him doing a monologue... went to check up on him. he was clicking on family member´s pictures and making calls. a few moments later, people started to message me saying they almost had a heart attack. some didn´t have the balls to answer... my sister had to leave a work meeting because she started to shake. they were scared. they were surprised. the best was people´s description of the moment they picked up the phone and saw my brother´s name on the screen, thinking he was calling from the beyond. we all had a good laugh.

"by playing a joke on a colleague who took it seriously. i ended up losing a vacation day and got a disciplinary action in my file.. i worked for a workman's compensation provider some time ago and there was a guy in my department - todd - who was mildly annoying.  nice enough guy, but just a bit juvenile.  he enjoyed pranks and was always trying to get a rise out of everyone in the office.  little things like taping our computer mouse or asking ransom for the return of our coffee cup. it got to be enough, so i decided he needed some payback.

he paid out a claim that was huge and he was nervous about it. i don't know why, but it just seemed like an opportunity to me, and so i waited. about a week later, in a team meeting (everyone was in on it but todd), i said that there were some payouts that were kicked upstairs for review and that it was a potentially serious situation.

a couple of days after that, i stopped and poked my head into his office and asked, ""did you payout x-amount on the smith file?"" he said he had and asked me why. i just walked away.

the following monday, i had my plan laid out fairly well.  after sharing the detail with my brother-in-law, he suggested that i borrow his black surplus impala cop-car and park it at the entrance. then, early that morning, i went about putting crime scene tape across the door to todd's his office.

i had the receptionist in on it too. when todd came in that morning, she would look at him, then fumble for the phone, turn her back and mumble into the receiver.

todd made it to the top of the steps when i rushed up to him and said, ""dude - go, just go!""

""what the hell are you talking about?"" he asked.

""just turn around and leave - drive, drive anywhere, just go!""

he shrugged me off, but i could tell that he was a little rattled. he turned the corner to see his office door blocked with crime scene tape and for a moment, he froze in his tracks. he walked past his office and around the corner, out of sight. he ended up slipping out through the stairwell.

he was gone for nine hours. i had to call his wife to get a message to him that it was a joke.

his absence meant that management got involved. i had to confess to being the perpetrator of the prank. i got a stern talking-to (my boss was trying really hard not to laugh) and i lost a vacation day as a result, but it was worth it.

todd doesn't tape my mouse anymore.


tl;dr  i played a practical joke on a colleague and he took it seriously


*edit:  i posted this thinking it might be amusing to a few of you and i wasn't expecting much of a response from it.  i have to say, i've enjoyed the pissy posts the most, the ones saying i went too far.  yes i did, which is why this was a fu.  for any of you worried about todd, he's fine.  this actually happened in 1993 and i posted it because todd and i were remembering it recently (and laughing) and so i had it on my mind.  yes, i still work with him (a different company now) and we've been friends for almost 25 years.*",4
"when i read my mom's recipes. throwaway because there's just no way i'm immortalizing this shit on my actual reddit account. 

this morning my mom messaged me to ask if i could come over and update the antivirus software on her pc. i agreed to drop in when i'm done working.

fast forward to me appearing in front of my mom's computer, initiating the update process, and proceeding to do nothing but stare at the progress bar. while i was doing that, my mom proceeded to prepare dinner. 

the update was taking forever so i decided to kill time by bringing necessary order to my mom's desktop. it was a mess. dozens of random folders scattered across the screen in no particular order whatsoever. i couldn't even see the fucking wallpaper. it was enough to summon the ocdemon buried inside of me and clean up the clutter. 

so, as i was organizing my mom's shit, i noticed a folder called ""mom's recipes"". now, as a guy who's dating a girl who loves a man who can cook, this folder peaked my interest. i figured it wouldn't hurt skimming over some of my mom's recipes and perhaps surprising the girlfriend with an unexpected home cooked meal.

i opened the recipe folder and clicked on the word document inside. now, i'll be honest, i'm not the world's most intelligent person, but when i see the words ""mom"" and ""recipes"", i imagine wholesome family dinners and shit. not...

""i'm a woman, i'm a widow, i'm a mother, i'm over 50, and i'm still the whore next door""

this was the fucking opening line to my mom's so called ""recipes"". it was an ominous sign that i should not read any fucking further. i read further. it became clear to me my mom's recipes had nothing to do with how to cook, but rather how to fuck. i made it through the first two pages before the ""recipe book"" went into graphic detail about what my mom's preferences were when it comes to size of the dick going into her mouth and vagina versus the size of the dick going into her ass. 

i closed the document, finished the update, and got the fuck away from that computer. my mom invited me stay for dinner but i declined. all i could see was different sized dicks entering my mother everywhere. i think i need to end our relationship now. 

tl;dr read my mom's recipes and realized her favorite ingredient is cock.",4
"by asking too much from my gf's mom. this actually happened today.

so my gf and her mother haven't spoken much in the last few years. she lives up in ohio and we reside in florida. well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.

the last time she visited, she saw an old wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the wii tennis game. i always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

now to the fuck up.

i thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working wii and wii sports game for the next time she visits.

so i text her: 

me: hey, guess what you can do next time you visit?

her: what's that?

me: bowl me! if you think you stand a chance. >:)

her: excuse me?

me: you heard me, lol.

so 20 minutes or so go by, and my gf calls me, laughing hysterically.

i never said ""bowl me"" oh no dear reddit, i wrote ""blow me""

luckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.

tl;dr: got wii sports for gf's mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of bowl me.",4
"by ordering underwear off of amazon.. 

not a fuck up that just happened, but one that i just realized happened. 

this christmas season, and like the last few, i did almost at all of my shopping via amazon. for friends and family that live far away i had their gifts shipped right to their house.

after spending more that i should this holiday season i haven't felt the need to buy anything until last week. i remembered i had a $50 amazon gift card, and decided to get myself more boxer briefs and black long sleeve undershirts. i ended up with around $70 (puma performance boxer briefs are super comfy) in my cart. a few quick clicks and one confirmation email let me know my order went through. 

like i said that was last week. but as of today the package still hadn't gotten here. so i checked my order and it says that it arrived. i was pissed. i had issues with delivery in the past. but i live in a small apartment building and i didn't think anyone would take my boxes. 

and then i noticed the address it shipped to. apparently amazon auto filled in the last address i used:

 my reddit secret santa. 

so one of you guys out there got a random shipment of underwear. if you could return them  pm me. i'd appreciate it. otherwise enjoy some comfy boxer briefs.

tl;dr my secret santa got a surprise gift.",4
"by farting during mass and making the priest laugh. this actually happened about an hour ago. i'm just now starting to come out of my humiliating shock.

so...i'm sitting at mass listening to the reading when i feel a slight grumble in my stomach,

""uh oh...gas.""

no biggie, this has happened before, i'll either wait for a song and let it go or wait for the homily (sermon for you protestants) and sneak over into the bathroom and take care of business. but alas, my body had other plans.

we stood to chant the psalm, the pressure is building, i'm starting to panic, not sure if i can hold it. we finish the psalm and the church goes to sit and just as i land on the pew...

it happened!

now this wasn't a quick fart, it was one of those that lasted a few seconds, a cheek rumbler, and the sound was amplified by the solid oak pew. it created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as gabriel's trumpet.

the church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, i looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. at this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...

the priest stands up at his chair, says ""i'm sorry...i'm sorry...i can't..."" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, i can hear him laughing.

at this point i decide it's a total loss, i shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.

tl;dr  farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now i gotta find another church. ",4
"by letting my wife into the bathroom while i was taking a shower. so we had just finished having a wholesome breakfast of eggs, potatoes and cinnabread my wife made and i hopped into the shower. when i shower i listen to a bluetooth speaker, mostly youtube. midway through my shower my wife unlocked the door and busted in claiming she had to pee. i'm a private person and always shower with the door locked, but obviously she isn't. after she finished she asked to come into the shower, but i was in the midst of shaving my legs (yes i'm a guy, i just don't like body hair) and told her no because i had a razor in my hand and our shower is a tiny two shoulder's width stall. she said fine and walked away. shortly after her departure my audio goes out, and i hear the sound of a cat meowing angirly into a microphone blare out of my speaker. this is followed by a series of animal noises and a slew of additional videos including such gems as ""top 3 minecraft songs"" and ""3 hours of farting."" sure enough, she'd stolen my phone. i got out of the shower when she started blasting victory royal fanfare and when she saw me she started dabbing furiously and ran away. this behavior continued for at least ten more minutes before i was finally able to get my phone back.

edit: first time using reddit, color me impressed. i did not expect this to get nearly the attention that it did and thanks very much to the lovely people who gave me the silvers and the gold! this is not an isolated incident, if my wife finds that i've left my phone unattended while she suspects my headphones are in she will steal it and my music will be instantly cut off and replaced. her go-to video is '3 hours of farting' and her stated goal is to one day have me make it through the entire video in this manner. i am extremely aware that she is an absolute gem of a woman and i'm very grateful to have her in my life, thanks to those of you who've pointed that out. for those of you 
asking, shower sex was not an option. our shower is smaller than the tiny shower stalls you'd find in the changing rooms at your local beach. we've done shower sex before, it's a miserable experience, shampoo bottles falling all over your ankles, would choose a bed every time.

tl;dr, i married a middle schooler in a 23 year old woman's body and got dabbed on.",4
"by ejaculating in my bed. throwaway obviously. this is a few months old but i feel like i have to get it out of my head.

so i know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but i've always done it in bed. i am living with my parents so i guess i just like the privacy of my room. then - and this is what i now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time i would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. i never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so i just kept doing it because it was easy... nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.

after some years of doing this i recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. i used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks i started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. this usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since i was always ejaculating on my wall/bed i began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. 

i didn't notice at first and since i've never had cockroaches before i didn't really know what they were but eventually i read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... at first i felt really disgusted. i wanted to exterminate them but i definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so i tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. but then i felt really bad.



i don't know why but it felt like murder. i didn't really dislike the cockroaches. i had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. so i decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point i finally began masturbating in the shower). i know this sounds really weird but i kind of began thinking of them as my children. it started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. i actually want kids when i grow up. and this was kind of like that - i used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and i just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.



then my parents found out. i think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while i was at school. 



so we had to move out for about a week to an airbnb and i was really depressed the entire time but i couldn't tell them why. they thought i just didn't like the airbnb.

tl;dr i jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation",4
"by toothpasting in the nude. this actually happened today and i'm still feeling the consequences. ..

while standing in the nude, waiting for the shower to warm up this morning i decided to try that toothpaste dance the kids do in the stands at hockey games. i was getting into quite the rhythm, doing really well and moving pretty fast. it felt invigorating... i noticed something was just a little off however, and started to make adjustments to try and figure it out. turns out i had my hands open and flat and you're supposed to have them in fists. well, i made fists and it looked perfect for a moment until i proceeded to punch the life out of my dick as it was flapping back and forth due to the motion of my hips.  i immediately bent over, smacked my face on the bathroom counter and fell to the floor. now i'm sitting here at work with a sore dick and forehead, feeling like a fool.

tldr: toothpasting nude, punched my dick and hit my head. left feeling like a  dickhead.

"by leaving my facial cleansing brush in my boyfriend's parents bathroom. this happened 2 weeks ago and i've only just stopped cringing entirely when i think about it.

my boyfriend and i were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. i took a shower, and i remember feeling really smug because i remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. for anyone that doesn't know what it is, it's literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. 

after using it, i wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when i had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. it's important to note that i had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the 'head' of it.

anyway, everything's fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and i are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for ""a word"" with my boyfriend. we both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.

after a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says ""why did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?""  obviously i was perplexed, saying i really had no idea what he was talking about. he was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as ""pink with a big bulb"" and then it hit me.

i too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as i explained what it was. unfortunately, i didn't realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. 

""you don't have to lie bloatedrabbit, it's ok but just next time don't leave it around for everyone to see.""

""i swear on my life it's a face cleanser!"" i said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. i handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. my boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he's a dirty old man for thinking like that. his dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when i think about it.

""well i'm sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother's toys!"" 


i'm not religious at all, but when i say i wanted god to beam me up there and then... i'm not kidding. i felt like jumping out the window. the whole energy of the room shifted. his dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn't dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.

worst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. my boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. talk about awkward.

tl;dr i left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend's conservative parents bathroom. his dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend's mum's toys.",4
"accidentally watching a black mirror episode with audio description on. not today, but black mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and i just remembered my fuck up. 

said episode was ""shut up and dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

now, i don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. so the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and i definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. but of course, the black mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

i think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. we were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

well, the end was near, and came the twist. normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. we were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? and to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

we were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as black mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. after some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  

tl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.





edit: mostly lurker, i don't know if there are any etiquettes i have to follow through, i will upvote everyone's comments for now.

for those who says it's not tifu, i guess it's mundane, that's true. since some folks are okay with the change of intensity? of fuck up, and so are mods,  i am at peace with it.",4
"by going jogging - i'm bloody and afraid to go this route again.. unlike most posts, this happened just half an hour ago. 

i'm a 21 year-old male. i was out running my 2 miles. headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. i round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and i see this big black duck looking at me. as i get closer, i think to myself, ""man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?"" i keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. so i stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. this bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.

i'm thinking to myself, ""what the fuck?"" so i'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and i keep running think he will leave me alone. i start running again and the faster i run, the faster he chases me. i start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. i'm thinking, ""i've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, i don't need this shit"" so i stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. in all my years of being a person, i've never trained for this.

this little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. he starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as i'm trying to run backwards away from him. we've covered a quarter mile at this point. i try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. i'm thinking, ""how the fuck am i gonna explain this if i have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? i'm a grown ass man. this is bullshit.""

i try running again and he keeps flying after me. i'm at a loss. i don't know what to do at this point. i'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. am i really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? like, i don't want to, but i might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? seriously?"" we have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. he bites me again and i drop my phone. i pick it up quickly. who do i call? i've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. while i'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, i hear a noise; someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.

this was a big mistake. the duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. i saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. i feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. the last i saw of him was the look i took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake i did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.

i cannot make this shit up. i would have recorded it, and i tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.

this is bullshit. i'm covered in cuts and bites. most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something i was not ready for.

tl;dr i'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. i'm covered in blood.

"by giving my 19 year old puggle the fat off my t-bone steak. this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. 

on mobile so forgive me for my sins. 

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he's been my best friend my whole life cause i'm 22. so he's all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, i was cleaning my t-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. i thought, ""man, buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so i proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. i proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (quickly for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so i didn't expect this, but i suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. i'm watching him eat it cause i'm all stoked he's enjoying himself & feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk irishman.   i instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so i grab the fucker & tug it out. he's unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. i'm freaking the fuck out. so i start giving him cpr. (i don't know how to do cpr for humans, let alone a dog, but i gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day i die. he lays there for a second & i rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug i gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat i ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. i monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. i gave him some love & he went to sleep. 

my life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us. 

tl;dr i brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat.

"by trying to inflate my penis like a dick balloon.. this fuck up took place 15 years ago when i was around 11 years old.   i had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  it got me thinking about how small my penis was.    i decided i needed to do something about this.   i did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   

now, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  i however knew that i had a penis, which had a hole, and i had a pump.   the pump i had, was a soccer ball pump.   the ones with the little metal needle.  well i examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   i stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   i decided the pain would be worth it.   i pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   it inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   since i was 11, i was not an anatomy expert.   the sensation gave me an erection, so i decided it must be working.  i inflated again.   it hurt a little this time, and now it felt like i had to pee.   i wanted results though, and people always say ""no pain, no game.""   i pushed the handle down again.   now i really fucking had to pee.

i removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   the sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   however, i really fucking had to pee.   i pushed super hard.   no man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  i get to claim that i guess.   the air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   it really hurt my dickhole.   amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    i can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.

15 years later it still hurts when i pee occasionally.  i am considering going to a urologist one day, however i am not sure how to address the issue.   the last thing i would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  

tldr:   i thought my penis was too small so i inflated it like a balloon.    it hurt when i peed.

"by putting a dildo in my gun case (nsfw). this happened a couple weeks ago...

my aunt and sister-in-law came to visit my neck of the woods, but i'd just returned from a business trip and hadn't been home yet when we met up. they wanted to see my new apartment, so we headed over to my place. i went back to my bedroom to change out of the airplane clothes (i can't be the only one who does this, right?), and notice i'd left a purple vibrator on my bedside table (my husband had jokingly purchased the brightest, most obnoxious purple vibrating eggplant he could find, because we're apart a lot for work and he laughs at my affinity for purple). i went to put it away just as my sister in law walked into my bedroom. having family see you holding a vibrating jelly stick strikes me as odd, so i ducked down and went for the first concealing item i saw: my pistol case. i quickly and snugly tucked the vibrator in the foam-lined case alongside my pistol, stuffed it under the bed and went on my merry way. no harm, no foul, no weird looks at thanksgiving.

a few days later, i'm headed to the gun range for some target shooting. i grabbed my guns, some ammo, and headed out. it was such a quick and seemingly insignificant moment with the vibrator, i'd forgotten about stuffing it into the pistol case (the gun is purple, too, btw). i arranged everything on the table, and opened my gun case. in what seemed like slow motion, i opened the gun case -- the dildo, uncomfortably stuffed alongside the pistol, rolls out of the case, perfectly bumps something (the table, i assume?), starts vibrating, and comes to a rest on the floor. past the table. this means, ladies and gents, that it's past the area you can go; there is a purple vibrating dildo lying amongst the spent brass shells. while i was in my own lane, there were 15-20 people in the other lanes. for the briefest moment, recognition seemed to fill the area as the gun range fell silent... 15 people watching the hapless dildo vibrate and twist it's way across the shooting range. fortunately, it was only a couple feet past the table, so i grabbed the broom intended for sweeping shells, pulled it back under the table, turned it off, and threw it away. looks like i have to find a new range now...

"by not reading a tinder bio. alright, so this happened ""yesterday"" so its technically  yifu. but whatever. 

so, a couple weeks ago i was swiping on el tinder when i saw a cute goth girl. lets call her lizzie. anyways, i was fairly tired at that moment and only glanced over the bio. this was the fuckup. 

lizzie and i match and get to talking. she is really nice, into the same nerdy shit i am, a fantastic shitposter, good conversationalist. and very,very cute. i'm thinking she is already my next girlfriend assuming things go well when we meet.

couple days later we go on the date. now, i've been catfished before, so i'm already expecting that she won't be as cute as she was online. nope. she shows up looking fantastic. (just like in the simulations!) we get sushi and are having a good time, so we decide to go back to my place. 

 after a drink, some anime and good conversation, we start making out. things are getting...heavy so we go into my room, she takes off my pants and starts giving me head. awesome.  she took off her bra, not flat chested either, double awesome.

(*tips fedora*) so i ask her to get on the bed and we make out some more and i go to take off her skirt. the next few moments were something like this:

""uhh... whatcha got there..?""

""oh my god i thought you knew""

*windows shutdown noice as my boner collapses*

""..nope. i had no clue""

soooooo, she had a dick. turns out, she did say she was trans in her bio. pre op.  been on hormones for a while and is going to make the switch. while im not transphobic or homophobic, i do have boundaries. i didn't freak out or anything. i assured her its fine, y'know shit happens. we ended up getting dressed, knocking back a few more shots and exchanging life stories until she sobered up and went home. ended up friends after all was said and done. 

always. read. bios.

tldr: didn't read a tinder bio, got my dick sucked by a pre op trans girl. took off her skirt, saw a dick.

edit: this is my first ever post on reddit. cant believe its made so many people laugh. glad more people got something out of my potentially awkward situation!

edit: a lot of people asked if i would consider dating her post op. yeah. why not? i felt like we hit it off. 

 update: she replied. verified this is ""lizzie""

"by almost getting my brother kicked out of my parents house over thermal paste. obligatory this was a few years ago.

i work in the it field, and have always been handy with computers.
growing up, when i lived in my parents house, i did computer repair here and there, and often had many computer parts and accessories with me.
when i left my parents house, i ended up leaving a few things behind in my room.

my brother was still living with my parents at the time, and he has been known to dabble in illegal activities. so my mom is already on the paranoid side of things.

fast forward about 2 years, and i get a frantic (frantic) call from my mom.

""i found a syringe in your room, and i think it's for drugs, but youre brother keeps lying to me and says it's yours! do you know anything about this?!?""

i ask some leading questions, and ask her what my brother said it was.

""he's saying it's for a computer, but i know better!""

ok, is any writing on it? does it have a needle?

""there's no needle, and there is a company name on the side""

ok, well whats the company name? and did you google it?

""it says thermaltek on the side. and when i went to google it, all it came up with was computer parts! i know you don't use syringes for computers!!!""

ok, so let's walk through this together ok?

1. you found said syringe and he said it was for a computer, and it was mine
2. you googled the company name and all you found were computer parts
3. you found it in my room
4. you know i work on computers
5. and there was no needles

it's thermal paste mom. it's used to apply a thin layer of paste for heat dispersion on the processor and graphics card. you're screaming at him over thermal paste. if it quacks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it swims like a duck.... did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe he was telling the truth?

""oh"" *click*

i give my brother a call to let him know what i just told my mom, and so he can never let her live it down.

tl;dr i forgot thermal paste in my room before i moved out, and my mom found it and instantly assumed my brother was shooting up heroin, and almost kicked him out, then wouldnt believe him after literally every piece of evidence was telling her otherwise.",4
"by forgetting i pranked my friend and accidentally giving him mild depression. mandatory this didn't happen today, but rather a few years ago...

back when i was at uni my best friend (james) and i used to always try prank each other creatively by getting on each other's facebooks/social media. think things like messaging our friends with odd messages trying to sell them a ridiculous pyramid scheme , changing each other's profile picture, etc... you get the idea.

one day near the end of my final year, we are in his room about to go for a night out and james goes to the bathroom, leaving his laptop unlocked (with facebook logged in). i take this as my opportunity to execute my latest master plan - i was going to change his post settings on facebook to ""only me"" (i.e. his posts would be invisible to anyone else) and post something outrageous and completely inappropriate (knowing he has his family on facebook). plan was that he would come in, see the post and freak out / get super pissed, for me to reveal the gaff to him and have a laugh.

however, i only managed to execute the first part of my plan (i.e. changing the setting to ""only me"") before he came back into the room, and i had to quickly exit facebook to avoid being found out.

now, the fuck up was that we went out, got quite drunk, came back home, and i completely forgot about this prank. fast forward to almost a year later...

my friend is still at uni (doing a masters degree) while i have moved to another city and started working. i should add that james is a big time electric guitar player, and in the last year got into recording videos of himself and posting them on youtube / social media. he messages me one day asking what i thought of his latest video on facebook. i went to his page and noticed there was no post... in fact, there were no posts for around a year...

i call him and tell him there's no post, to which he says that can't be, i posted it yesterday and am looking at the post now. i'm on the phone with him when it suddenly just \*clicks\* and i am immediately mortified - this entire time, i had left the ""only me"" setting on, and he hadn't realised. i hang up to compose myself before calling him back and telling him the truth.

for the last year or so, he had been posting several videos and had received 0 likes or comments. he had taken most of his previous videos down, had wondered why nobody liked his videos, if people just hated him since most of his friends graduated, if he was really crap at guitar... one thing he told me in particular was particularly heart-breaking - ""i often layed awake at night thinking about this"". i don't want to use the term depression too loosely, but it really affected him and he considered going for counselling.

luckily he was good about it and didn't hold a grudge, and we now laugh about it. bought him a lot of drinks next time i saw him though.

tl;dr  forgot i changed my friend's facebook settings so that nobody else could see his posts, he thought nobody liked him and was mildly depressed for a year.

edit: grammar

edit 2: i should add that i was of course extremely apologetic and remorseful after this happened, and still feel terrible when i think about it. he understandably was pissed at first, but realised it was completely accidental and was just a colossal fuck up. the ""reveal"" itself was over 6 months ago, i was reminded earlier today when i saw an obvious ""stupid facebook prank"". we still talk amost daily, and he is staying with me until he finds a flat once he also moves to the same city as me for work in a couple weeks (will make sure to keep my laptop locked though...)

edit 3: just to clarify, he wasn't just starting to play guitar. he has played since he was a kid and is genuinely a great guitar player. during his masters, he started filming cover videos/recordings as a hobby. his videos now get several likes and complimentary comments

edit 4: so a lot of people have been asking for posting a link to his videos. after watching this blow up, i called my friend and linked him the reddit. he is amazed and wants everyone to know he's fine. he isn't keen on me sharing his actual profile for privacy reasons, but said i could post some (starting with one) of his videos on a separate youtube account and linking it to this post. here is the cover he wanted to share with me that exposed the fuck up: https://youtu.be/eh\_m88iuovk(https://youtu.be/eh_m88iuovk).

"by snacking my wife's sister on the ass during a coed softball game thinking she was my wife.. most tifus don't get posted the same day they happened, this one is no different.
flash back 3 and a half years ago to our fall league of softball. my wife's family always has a softball team every year in their church league and our team consists of my wife, her 3 other sisters, their husband's, my father in law, myself and normally one random girl that normally changes from year to year.

just a little back story, my wife is 135 lbs but also has a generously large behind for her size and i being a male, enjoy smacking it for obvious reasons. (told you it was a little back story) 

cut to me making the 3rd out by catching a fly ball in left center and jogging into the dugout behind everyone. upon reaching the dug out, i see my wife in front of me walking in. i decided to take my baseball glove, reach back, and slap her on the ass.  immediately something felt off. i've smacked my wife's ass a lot, she enjoys it and she knows i enjoy it. the reciprocating ripple that normally can be felt when slapping her behind normally was not felt. my wife's sister turns around (who is much much much more conservative when it comes to intimacy or even being premiscoous) and my jaw drops. 
""i.. uh... thought you were.. zelda"" i babbled 
i start panicking because i just spanked my sister in law's ass in front of the entire game and didn't want to be murdered by my wife. i turn some shade of red and started contemplating how to injure myself so i could get away from my soon to be death. 
luckily my wife and all of her sisters are practically clones of each other, blonde hair blue eyes, and extremely beautiful (my wife being the best out of them all) they have been mistaken for each of the other ones their entire lives.
they all laugh and i am still made fun of every time we play. i now always make sure to look at my wife's face prior to spanking her bottom (in public) 

my wife loves bringing this story up to embarrass me now. 

tl:dr smacked my wife's sister on the ass because they all look the same and have the same body types, didn't get murdered but get made fun of to this day for it still",4
"by trusting a ""hot local single in my area"" on a dating app.. greatest/worst thing ever just happened to me, so buckle up folks..it's story time:




girl on a dating app tells me in the first few messages that i'm really cute (true) and interesting (also true) and asks me to meet her at 1140am for coffee at a random mcdonald's. when i ask if she's a 45 year old man trying to harvest my organs, she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they're straight from facebook. because that's how you convince somebody you're real (not true).




now normally i don't accept propositions like this because i'm thinking ""what's the catch?"" well, i decide to live a little on the yolo side...and since it's right next to a subway sandwich shop i think that the worst that could happen is it's a 45 year old lonely man, i give him a big hug because i know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man, get a tasty sandwich, then go home. apparently that was not the worst thing that could happen.




i show up. she shows up. she's real. i'm surprised. i buy her coffee because i subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise. she uses her mccafe frequent buyers card so she gets stamps. its cute. while the guy is making her drink, she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun. i go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because i'm a romantic at heart. 5 minutes later. 10 minutes later. 15 minutes later. no girl. i text her the typical guy message ""lol u get lost???"". no response. turns out she took the coffee and left.




so i'm not saying it's bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or aren't attracted to them. it's totally your decision. but i don't think that's the case...i think this girl is a serial mccafe dater. and i don't think this was her first time. it was too professional. too clean. it was the perfect mcheist. and i'm starting to think i'm not even mad...she didn't steal my credit card, or my organs. just a few euros.




and my heart.

"by letting my girlfriend touch my element and mineral collection. yea yea what a nerd, he collects the periodic table.

well i do, it's not the largest but contains some of the more interesting or rare elements. it sits in a display case in my room, and looks like this
https://imgur.com/a/drj8sjr

so the fuck up begins when i order the element cobalt. it has to ship from italy where i get the elements + jars, and it arrived broken.
i emailed them, and they responded in a very wholesome and google translated email(https://i.imgur.com/v5vodvy.jpg) saying they would replace the jar. 

so the jar arrives and i transfer the cobalt sample from some other storage container into it's designated jar. everyone would be fine if it stays in the jar. my girlfriend is at my house at the time, and i hand it to her to put in the display case, which she spends a while at.

 i assume she's looking at some of the cooler samples like gold, platinum, or gallium,  i think nothing of it. later on her hand gets really red and itchy. like reeallly bad. it looks like she stuck her hand into poison ivy.
she's in a lot of irritation and some pain and i think i know the cause.

""did you take the cobalt out of its jar""

""yea i held it and looked at it""

i know she did more than that, probably shook it around in her hand or something.
for those of you who don't know, cobalt has an effect called ""contact dermatitis"" which basically means, you touch it, and it makes you really uncomfortable. once you have one reaction, you'll most likely develop a lifelong allergy. cobalt also known to cause cancer, but only with frequent contact. 

so now her hand was feeling a bit better but it looked terrible. there wasn't much anyone could do, so that sucks for her.
i had to deal with the fact that i handed her a very toxic metal and didn't tell her. yay for me. major fuck up and i'm an idiot. 

tl;dr i handed my girlfriend a toxic metal and she touched it causing a painful reaction and probably gave her a lifelong allergy to it. oh and the metal also causes cancer.

*edit:* ok also i want to to throw this in there, that this probably won't be that much of a problem. she doesn't want to study chemistry, and how many times in your life will you come into contact with elemental cobalt? yea, zero. it would have to be pure elemental cobalt, not alloys. she wasn't mad about it either, we laugh about it.

edit 2: i need to be more specific about the allergy. everyone will have a reaction to cobalt. we are all allergic. but after your first serious exposure, you're significantly more sensitive to it. i didn't really _give_ her an allergy, i just made her more vulnerable to cobalt. also, don't blame her. this is my fault and i should have been more clear. she is a smart person and it's not her fault. this is not ""today someone else fucked up""

edit 3: so more people are expressing interest in element collecting rather than in expressing sympathy for my poor girlfriend. i created a sub, r/collectingelements to start you people up. in case you were curious, here are my current elements and the _cursed cobalt_

"by not hitting my girlfriend's ass. short and sweet one: today, my girlfriend and i were presented the rare treat of an empty apartment, and thus decided to get nice and loud.  as she was riding me cowgirl, i decided to give her ass a nice hard slap; however, as we were being rougher than usual, she was bouncing up and down in a manner that made it hard to hit her bum.  thus, on my attempt at spanking her, my hand instead collided against my left testicle.  instantly, a pain shot through the core of my very being, causing me to cry out in pain.  my girlfriend, being the epitome of love and sympathy that she is, immediately collapsed on the bed cackling like a mad witch while i cradled my bruised babymakers.

tl;dr: attempted a blind slap on a quickly moving bum, bitchslapped my testicles instead.

edit: apparently, everyone has been slapping their testicles lately, so i'll just go ahead and say that my left nut and i sincerely wish i was reposting.",4
"by pranking my girlfriend. yesterday i decided to prank my girlfriend by pretending to be my twin brother. random as fuck, i know. but i've always wondered if i could fool her into thinking i was him. it was time. 

so, there i was, approaching my house and ringing my doorbell completely in character. i was wearing torn denims and converse sneakers, the complete opposite of what i normally wear but exactly the style to match my bro. i was walking like him, talking like him, sounding like him, hell, even smelling like him. 

my girlfriend eventually opened the door and saw deepfake me standing there. regardless of how well prepared i was to play my twin brother, the moment i locked eyes with my girlfriend, i expected her to see right through my facade. she stared at me, confused. at first i wasn't sure if that was because she knew it was me or because she was surprised to see it's my brother.

there was only one way to find out. i said hi and dropped the ""i was in the neighborhood"" line. my girlfriend suddenly pulled me inside and slammed the door shut. 

girlfriend: are you out of your fucking mind showing up here like this?

me: uh... thought i'd visit.

girlfriend: and i thought we agreed to stop seeing each other. 

me: what do you mean?

girlfriend: what the fuck do you mean, what do i mean? whatever that shit was between us, it's over. go home to your fiancee. 

me: enough. it's me. your boyfriend. 

girlfriend: you don't know when to give up, do you? 

i showed her my id. i'd never seen so many mixed emotions flash across her face until that moment. at first she tried to play it off like she was in on the act all along and this whole interaction was nothing more than a cheating girlfriend narrative she fabricated on the spot just to fuck with me. i wasted no time calling my brother and fucking forcing a confession out of him. the motherfucker admitted to seeing my girlfriend on and off behind my back for months. when that call ended, so did my relationship with both of them.

"by broadcasting porn to my son's room.. this happened to me 30 minutes ago and i didn't know what to do some i am going to chronicle it here.

it all started with my son asking if i could use airplay to stream some league of legends games to his t.v. since worlds are going on. i was reluctant at first since it was almost his bedtime, however i figured what the hell i do things like that all the time so i should go ahead and let him watch until 12ish. he tells me what games he wants to watch and i set up the connection and explain to him that i would let him stay up until 12, however he isn't to tell his mom because she would kill me since his bed time is 10.

my wife works from home and does most of her work at night while everyone is in bed because me and my son are ""loud and obnoxious"". at the time of the incident she is in her office, which is across the hall from my son's room, with the door locked while she is working. i was watching some carnival row and i said to myself ""self, now is an opportune time to stroodle the ole noodle. i pull out my phone and go to my incognito mode, ;) gotta be safe, and precede to search me out a suitable video. after a few minutes of searching i found some material and decided to go ahead and start it while i gathered the appropriate tools for the job. i press play and lay my phone on the bed and go grab some lotion and tissues. i jump back into bed placed my items beside of me and reached for my phone. that is when i realized it. i am panicking, fuck fuck fuck, across my screen it has airplay and my son's t.v. was selected. 2 minutes has passed in the video and i thought ok maybe nothing has showed yet so i change it back to league and started to gather myself to go talk to him.

that is when i hear it. my wife is screaming to the top of her lungs and i hear my son pleading with her and i here him say something about dad (you little tattle tale). she is on a war-path now. uh oh. i start panicking ""oh shit oh shit oh shit"" it is like getting caught watching porn by your own mom. then things go silent and i know she is coming for me i hastily throw the tissues and lotion under the bed and roll over and try to pretend i went to sleep. she kicks the door open, and i pressing my head through my pillow at this moment. she screams my name. my mind went blank and i made a snoring sound. that was probably the real fuck up. i heard her say, ""oh this bitch going to pretend to be asleep, ok ok."" i decided i needed to answer her or i am a dead man. i rolled over and said ....yea? at this point i am waiting for her to make like a cartoon and turn into a steam whistle. she precedes to chew me a new one. to paraphrase something like ""here i am working then i hear people fucking across the hall and come to find out your streaming porn to his room, blah blah irresponsible, blah blah dumbass, blah blah sleeping on the couch"". she storms off and i heard her office door slam. i gather a blanket and my pillow and go to the couch, my son's door is shut and i don't want to press my luck as i walk by. i head to the couch and thought you know this needs to go to and here i am. hopefully she doesn't smother me in my sleep lol.

thanks for the silver and gold kind strangers, you honor me. wow and platinum, thanks a lot. :d

edit/update 1: wow, woke up and this post really blew up. wife woke me up this mourning so we could talk about what happened lol. she wasn't upset by the porn, she was upset because she thought our son had porn blasting on his t.v. at 12 at night while he was suppose to be asleep and interrupting her work. which escalated when she found out that i told him he could stay up until 12 and i, in fact, was the one who did the porn streaming. which escalated when she opened the door and i was pretending to be asleep. one thing i wanted to address is that she is by no means a bitch, she is an amazing and wonderful woman that just lost her cool. we have all been there at some point. we don't have an abusive relationship. she is the authoritarian in the house and i am a bit of a goofball, however we are fine with that as we rarely have a disagreement and compliment each other very well.

update 2: talked to my son while taking him to school and he finds the situation hilarious and can't wait to tell his friends. when i told him i can't believe he threw me under the bus he told me i would do the same and he is right.

update 3: sorry i have no intention of linking the ""sauce"" some mysteries are better left unsolved.

tl:dr i was using airplay to stream videos to my sons room while he was suppose to be sleeping, decided to spank it and accidentally streamed porn to my son's room while my wife was right across the hall from him.",4
"and punched a total stranger in the face. this literally happened about 15 minutes ago. i was walking behind this lady pushing a pram with a kid inside playing with a helium  balloon. i suddenly see her baby accidentally let go of his balloon so i instantly turn on my hero-mode and extend my hand to grab the balloon string. it was a really epic and glorious moment and in my mind i was already playing out how cool i looked and how the lady would thank me for saving the balloon. unfortunately, i did not manage to grab it in time. i did however end up with my hand in a closed fist straight into another man's cheek who was walking next to me. now there's a crying baby in front of me and a very shocked, confused and upset stranger beside me. i think after the initial shock he did realise i was only trying to do a good deed so he didn't say anything to me but either way i immediately slowed down in embarrassment  and let them walk ahead of me...i am the hero this city does not need.

"by letting my nephew play with my google home mini. i live alone and like to set up my place as 'smart' as possible. so i have smart lights, speakers, smart locks and some other stuff set up. i set up a few 'joke' routines on google assistant that i would show my friends for a laugh.

my whole family came over on the weekend and i was showing my 5 year old nephew how to use google home to change the color of the lights. which he thought was the greatest thing in the world.

so cue the whole family coming to my bedroom to see the little guy having the time of his life. he says 'hey google!' followed by what sounded like a bit of gibberish. but google assistant thought he said 'wank mode'. which just so happens to be one of the 'joke' routines i set up.. it gets triggered by saying either 'wank mode' or 'jerky jerky time'.

it basically goes like this.

google assistant says 'engaging wank mode, my lord'

front door locks

bedroom light turns to 100% brightness and turns red

bedroom speaker plays  led zeppelin - immigrant song

"by not washing my hair properly for over 10 years. i have not clue when this fu started but i do know that i realised my error at the age of around 25, i'm currently 34.

i was recently reminded of this after seeing this particular image(https://preview.redd.it/k4wt3q2b25a31.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27404351cf1bfa999bd9d068776855a4230687da) on another subreddit.


backstory:


like most children, i was bathed by my parents up until an age where they felt i was getting to old to have them help me, around 9, 10,11, or 12 (for a guess, god knows). i remember that both parents had taught me the importance of cleaning everywhere efficiently. i used to hate it when my father washed my hair. he used to scrub it so hard that it would shake my head and i could feel each of his fingers digging into my scalp when he did it.


after i was old enough to wash myself, as well as the usual instructions of what to make sure i had washed, he always told me to give my head a good scrub. it's only after realising my fu that i recalled my fathers instructions from all those years ago.

i can only presume that once i had the ability and trust to clean myself, i choose to ignore my fathers advice about washing the shampoo in deep and hard with my fingers. for many years i would use shampoo and just rub in onto my hair with the palms of my hands for an amount of time that i thought sufficient before washing it off again.

i'm half white and half black and although my hair has always been fairly short, it has an tough afro texture. i could be stood in the shower for an hour with water pouring on my head and the hair would remain sticking up. i'm not sure whether this was a factor or not but i could never style my hair in any way. so it wouldn't need combing when i got out of bed or out of the shower, it just stayed upright constantly and it still does.


for as long as i remembered every time i went to the barbers i would notice a huge about of what i thought was dry skin falling all over the black gown. i used to be so embarrassed about this and constantly tell the barbers that i had a dry scalp condition. i ever purchased special shampoo to treat dry scalp but nothing helped.


i couple of times a barber would tell me that i needed to clean my head properly. i just presumed that they didn't understand a dry scalp when they saw one. before going to the barbers i would have long showers washing my hair for ages but nothing helped, 30 mins later i would be in the barbers chair with white flasked falling all over the place.


one time it was so bad that about five people in the barbers made comments about the amount of flakes scattered all about me during a cut. i was a little embarrassed but just told them all about my dry scalp condition. at the end of this particular cut i looked like i had been out in the snow for an hour.


so the realisation came one day when i was around 24/25 and i was washing my ears. other than a five second rinse around with my fingers, i never really put much thought into cleaning the inside of my ears. i don't know why but on this occasion i decided to put shampoo inside my ears. i washed around for a while and after a few seconds i start to hear/feel my fingers squeaking, having washed away any oil that was there.


i suddenly thought of the phrase 'squeaky clean', and it all of a sudden dawned on me. memories of my father hurting my head with his fingers came back to me. i had never heard or felt my head squeak in this way since i was a kid.


i quickly emptied a load of shampoo on my hair and instead of using my palms i dug in my fingers (hard) and started scrubbing. after a while on a certain spot i heard/felt a squeak.


omg! right there and then i quickly realised that i didn't have a dry scalp condition, i had just not properly cleaned my hair for all of these years. i washed the whole of my head until all of it squeaked.


i've made sure to clean to the squeak each time since. on the next trip to the barbers there was not a single white flake anywhere and there hasn't been one since.


i told the barber the doctor had given me some medication which has fixed my problem so that i didn't have to confess to being a dirty, dumb idiot. i will make sure my son never has to go though this by telling him my story.


tl/dr

for ten years i thought that i was covering the barbers gowns in white flakes because i had a dry scalp problem. it turned out that i just didn't know how to wash my hair properly.

"(shoulda just left my neighbor alone). im keeping names besides mine out of this for privacy. i step outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch roughly 2 hours ago and as im trying to get my lighter to work i hear crying first off my front porch to my house is enclosed by white gate wall with little holes same for the door so nobody can even see through from the outside, however i can see through from the inside ( it's nice to be able to catch scumbags trying to break into my car in the middle of the night because of this) anyway, i look for the crying it didnt sound like a child it sounded like a full grown woman. i quickly find out who is crying directly across the street from my house to the right 1 house i see my neighbor's significant other on her knees crying like she was. a. beaten up, or b. devastated from something such as a breakup. i heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. i assumed the latter. so i wanted to check if she was at the very least unharmed. i usually keep my nose out of peoples business but the inner captain save a hoe in me kicked in for some reason tbh i try to look out for my neighbors regardless my reasoning behind it is because you live next to them so you may as well be social once or twice just to know if things are going to be chill.

i walk across the street and introduce myself i have not spoken to these people before because they are never home until almost midnight and they leave around 6 a.m. damn near everyday they were very quiet and not nosy in anyway so i never attempted to talk to them when a opportunity to do so in the past arose. i say ""hi im taylor, i apologize for the intrusion i just want to make sure you aren't harmed."" clearly very upset she hardly could speak clearly and started to try to say ""he doesn't want to be with me anymore"" im relieved to know she is fine physically so im ready to say ""best of luck"" and head home. not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and its the neighbor he starts yelling is this the motherfucker you're seeing?.. how did he come to that conclusion? ( if i recognized his face sort of why cant he? ) i try to immediately say ""im your neighbor i was just trying to make sure she was unharmed."" then the woman fucks me over dragging me into the drama further she yells "" yeah, this is taylor and hes way better than you in everyway!"" my face turns red out of anger my eyes wide open and mouth agape, why the fuck would you say that? the dude likely interpreted that as why did you just tell him the truth im sure thats how he interpreted it because just as i finish saying wtf to this woman i get punched so fucking hard, i should have seen it coming he was visibly very angry. 

&#x200b;

( now i've done time in prison so i am no stranger to fighting the only reason i mention this is because i want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. i do not call cops, i do not ever run from a fight. i never ever ever stick my nose into other peoples business and i broke that rule over a woman crying.)

&#x200b;

i am on someone elses property i get hit. well i have cameras outside my house and i know that his house is within full view so i could have just called the cops and been done with it but no this is something i considered not one bit. i unloaded on this guy he was the same size and build however i was probably in better shape than him aside from my lungs. this woman that made things worse is now full blown hysterical she wailing and crying louder and harder than before and i just beat up my neighbor he beat me up too but this wasn't my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie. soft hands no calluses he absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially but he made a huge mistake as well as i. the noise from this other woman drew the attention of other neighbors now i know most of the immediate surrounding ones except 2 and guess which neighbors came to investigate?take a wild fucking guess? the neighbors i dont know and they are on the phone. (fuck..........my...........life) i decided ill go home and pull up the recording so if the police show up i have some sort of defense. i have a record and things look bad im expecting to go to jail for trespassing, assault you name it.

10 minutes later a patrol car arrived and a cop bangs on my door i have the recording on my phone so all i have to do is hand the phone to our officer and let fate decide. i gave my statement in cuffs and im in the back of the car for almost 45 minutes im thinking this is it im screwed. then the magic happened a second patrols car shows up and both officers start talking and watch the video i asked them to look at i know the first officer already saw the video almost right away so im thinking yes they believe me and dude is gonna get his. sure enough they place him in the car and the officer comes over opens the door for me and says step out  unlocks the cuffs and said im not under arrest and that my video saved my ass then they cuff the woman and throw er in the car i was in i asked why she was getting arrested she wasnt in the fight directly. and then i heard the scummiest most absolute piece of garbage thing ever. they both, the couple, tried to say i attacked the dude threatened the woman and i was trying to threaten them from calling the police what the absolute fuck. an hour ago they were against each other to the point where the woman was getting kicked out of the house. and they actually tried to get me thrown in jail. now the officer said that it looked like what they were saying was true or close to the truth when they watched the video but the audio is what made sure i was innocent they where able to hear part of  the conversation because of their yelling. never again, never will i enter drama and if my neighbor is seen again i will enjoy scaring him with intimidating looks.

&#x200b;

tldr - i saw a female neighbor that i didnt know at all crying. went to see if things were fine and it turned into getting puched, almost arrested with accusations of assault and threats",4
"by sending my crush eleven drunk texts.. i awoke this morning with a killer headache, only to discover i had spam texted my crush last night. my completely wasted brain probably thought it was the greatest idea ever to text him, and now my mostly sober brain wants to move to cuba.

such wonderful messages included: 

- ""jar jar binks was a fucking mistake"" (after drunkenly purchasing the prequel saga dvd set on amazon).

- ""i've had several beers and a whole box of lucky charms. . .that means i am three percent made of lucky charms now""

- ""also i figured it out finally. why you're such a cute, you look like jospeh gordon levity and he was great in the movies""

- ""get ready for some math""

- ""you're a smart guy you will undertaken""

- ""i don't think i ever been so drunk than right now what is more than several because that is how many""

honestly, i'm hoping we can laugh this off. if you see this, man, i'm sorry! 

tl;dr: i drunk-texted my crush several times and sounded like the biggest idiot ever.

edit: for anyone asking if he responded, yes, he did! he agreed that jar jar binks was a total mistake, and suggested hangover cures. and i admitted he was really cute and that i threw up the lucky charms(https://imgur.com/a/mo3a7jo).

edit #2: yes, i am female (not that it should really matter). by ""man of culture"" he meant the meme.

edit #3: holy moly, thank you guys all so much for your kind words!

"when i made my uber driver have an existential crisis.. this happen to me about an hour ago. my car broke down and had to call uber for a ride across town to work (which is about 40 minutes away). i work for a pretty big company and when he saw the address the conversation started. *(for my privacy and the privacy of others, i'm going to change the name of my job and the people i'm speaking of.)*

ud: ""hey man, you work *job*? how do you like it?""

me: ""it is pretty good. pay is great, people are nice...can't really complain.""

ud: ""bruh that is really good man. gotta work hard these days, don't know if you'll have another chance, you know?""

me: ""yeah man. i get you.""

ud: ""i actually got a friend that works up there. he use to make websites all the time and he was excited when you guys hired him.""

me: ""i'm glad to hear that. what is his name?""

ud: ""my boy frank.""

me: ""frank...gallagher?""

ud: ""hell yeah, he is super smart and had a streak of bad luck with jobs. then he got hired there and we knew he was set.""

me: ""um..when was the last time you talked to him?""

ud: ""its been about 2-ish years. me and my girl had a kid and lost contact with a few people but now that you reminded me of him, i'm going to hit him up soon.""

me: ""i don't know if that is possible, frank died like 2 years ago.""

ud: "".....what? nah man. we must be talking about two different people.""

me: ""i've been working there for a while and we have had only one frank gallagher to work for us. he died in the summer of 2014 i believe.""

ud: ""no, he didn't. i'm going to call him right now because i'm pretty sure we are talking about two different people bruh.""

**calls frank on his phone and the number is disconnected**

ud: ""he probably didn't pay his bill. you know how us black people are with our bills and shit. hahaha""

me: ""ummm...i trained him when he was hired. i'm sorry you found out this way but he was the only one.""

ud: ""he wasn't some young dude. he is about my age, like 40...""

me: ""or early 50's? black, slender, short with salt and pepper hair. chipped tooth? yeah, frank. i know him because i really like him. worked harder than any other young guy i've ever trained. he died, man. i'm really sorry you found out like this.""

**uber driver starts to cry and pulls over**

ud: ""i....what...we were around the same age. what the fuck?!""

me: ""i'm sorry...i don't know what to say"" *looks at the clock on my phone*

ud: ""he is way to young to die man. we are both in our 40's bruh.*

he eventually collected himself and kept driving. still got to work on time. i took a picture of frank that i had on my desk and sent it to him, so he could realize we are talking about the same person.

**tl;dr** i, a stranger, informed a friendly uber driver that one of his friends died and we shared a very emotional car ride together. 
 
**edit** name and grammar

**update** this has really blown up. i didn't expect this post to have so many responses or all the weirdly negative inbox messages i received that say ""kill yourself asshole"" or ""scum for doing that to a person"". i screenshot'd the text message between the uber driver and i.(http://imgur.com/gallery/erxbp) wasn't mean or anything, he just wanted me to be certain about ""frank"".

"by reading contract law textbooks to my 2 year old. obligatory this happened 7 years ago, as my son is now 9, and this decision has now come back to haunt us.

background filler:


(i graduated law school in december 2007 and passed the bar exam in february 2008.  i kept my barbri materials as i was going to trade with a friend who took the bar in a state i was debating taking it in, but that never worked out, so they remained in the office.)

the story:


our son was born in 2009 and this happened in 2011-12.  he was not any easy child to get to go to bed and we would often read to him for hours.  one night i had enough and decided to find the most boring thing i could, so i pulled out my barbri book on contracts and started reading it.  he was fascinated and demanded i read more and more.  he'd ask questions, like any good dad i answered.  so i was teaching my 2.5-3 year old contract law, and eventually more advanced contract law.  

fast forward to kindergarten.  he got upset with his teacher one day because she entered into a verbal contract to give them an extra recess if they did x and y.  well they did, but it rained, so she couldn't give them the time.  this did not sit well, as our son proceeded to lecture her on the elements of a verbal contract and how one was created and she breached it.  she had no answer for him, and we had a talk about it with her.

unfortunately, this behavior didn't stop.  he would negotiate with adults for things he wanted, and if he felt he performed his side of the contract, he would get angry if they breached.  he will explain to them what the offer was, how he accepted it, and what was the consideration.  and if they were the ones who made the offer, he would point out any ambiguity was in his favor.   when they tried pointing out kids can't enter contracts, he counters with if an adult offers the contract, they must perform their part if the child did their part and they cannot use them being a child to withhold performance.  

this eventually progressed to him negotiating contracts and deals with his classmates in second grade**.  only now he knew to put things in writing, and would get his friends to sign promissory notes.  he started doing this when they started doing word problems in math. he knew these weren't enforceable, but would point out his friends did not know this.   we eventually got him to stop this by understanding he couldn't be mad because he knows they can't form a contract.  

it culminated in third grade when he negotiated with his teacher to have an extra recess.  this time, he remembered to have her agree that she would honor it later if it rained (which it did).  so then she said she wouldn't, and he lost it and had to see the principal.   who agreed with him and talked to the teacher.

now that this happened, we had to also see the principal to discuss this.  she is astounded how good he is at this, but acknowledges we need to put a stop to it*.  so it is now put in his education plan that adults cannot engage in negotiation with him as he is adept at contract formation and tricking adults into entering verbal contracts.  

tldr: i taught my 2-3 year old contract law out of desperation to get him to go to bed.  when he got to school he used these skills to play adults. 

edit: *when i say put a stop to it i mean the outbursts when adults don't meet their obligations in his eyes. the principal encourages him to talk out solutions and to find compromise. 

edit 2: **clarified the time line and added context. ",4
"by kicking a chestnut, stopping traffic for an hour and getting cornered by a lynch mob. so obligatory this happened yesterday but i'm still traumatised as i've never really encountered confrontation on such a big scale.

so let me set the scene first. i live (and grew up) in a fairly densely populated city in europe that has a good amount of nature patches. the people are genuinely quite friendly and usually not too short-tempered unless strangers (a.k.a non-locals) are involved. the location of this fu was a pretty busy junction just down the road of my flat - think two car lanes, cycling lanes, and pedestrian crossing. anyway, it was just before rush hour, around 4 pm and the sun was grilling everyone in europe (climate change - yeiy) for the past 3 weeks.

i was strolling down the road towards the junction completely blanking my surrounding as i was trying to come up with the perfect dish to surprise my gf in the evening. picture that quiet guy just minding his own business, head down, focusing on every single step - yep that's me. suddenly, i bump my head into a rock - or so i initially thought. i look up. it was the largest man i've ever seen - about the size of the mountain from got. he looked like a bodybuilder on steroids with a side of extra muscle (let's call him arnie). i was startled for a second before i see his buddy (let's call him sly) who was quite a bit shorter but just as wide as he was tall - so still quite intimidating for an under-the-radar-guy like me. ""oi, watch where you are going"" i bellow (jk, obviously arnie did). so being super alpha and dominant i mumble ""sorry"" and move around them to continue my walk to the supermarket. ""i mean how the f\*\*\* was i meant to walk past them when they literally block the whole pavement standing next to each other."" i think and kick a chestnut out of frustration - metaphorically releasing and passing on all my problems. and oh boy that worked - somewhat. what happened next i could not have imagined in a thousand lifetimes. hey, i mean even with the current ai technology i doubt they would have been able to predict that outcome.

i see the chestnut flying roberto carlos style towards the junction (hell, i heard the crowd roaring) and imo it probably even broke the sound barrier. while the chestnut was still in flight i raise my hand in pride having reclaimed my manliness with this superb treasure of a shot. and i'm talking the eager-please-pick-me-keen-bean-susan from middle-school hand raise (no, susan mayonnaise is not an instrument).

suddenly everything kept coming down.

the chestnut flew past a motorcyclist (around 3 feet high) who must have registered some kind of movement in front of him and he immediately hit the break. remember how i said they had nature patches in the city? well, the city installed sprinklers to keep the grass hydrated and green, but they somehow have their own spirit and love releasing water into the most inconvenient directions.

you guessed it, despite almost 40°c there was a puddle the size of a small american town right there in front of the breaking motorcyclist. his breaking turns into sliding, into rotating, into falling and finally into that metal-to-asphalt-screeching halting. behind him, a red car doesn't manage to break in time but does a fast and the furious drift and slides past the motorcycle also coming to a halt in the middle of the crossing around 5 meters away from the motorcyclist. then my attention is caught by the opposing lane as the red car just cut off a blue car's path who does the same drift (thanks to the puddle) and ends up head-on with the bumper wrapped around the traffic light post. by a miracle of god (or chance for the atheists) the post was harder than a dick after a two-week dry period and withstood the incident without giving in. yet the ten or so pedestrians waiting behind it scattered away with two stumbling over each other and falling flat faced. what followed after this was the loudest concert of honking cars and screaming, followed by screeching breaks from all directions.

and then a split second of silence.

until i hear a majestic roaring that simba would be proud of: ""duuuuuuude, what the fuck!!!"", yup arnie and sly walk up behind me and instantly get the attention of about another ten surrounding pedestrians that just at that moment exited the supermarket next to me. they start to explain what they saw to the others ('me causing this accident on purpose and celebrating') and suddenly an elderly man (let's call him miyagi) grabbed my wrist with the iron grip of a cyberman.

at that moment my life flashed in front of my eyes. my future, my spotless criminal record, my clumsy soap handling skills and my virgin butt hole. i was not going to make it a single night in prison.

suddenly the commotion starts - picture a real madrid vs barcelona team vs. team fight - all traffic stops, everyone gets out of their cars and comes towards our little ensemble - shouting. i've never seen a crowd agree that fast on anything but within 30 seconds everyone was pointing at me with red faces, anger in their eyes and most of them looked like they were going to release their super saiyan form on me while i was still trying to flee miyagi's claws (i know, statistically not all of them could have been super saiyans but still). what i haven't mentioned yet is that i actually look fairly mixed-race and live in a very white neighbourhood - so within another 30 seconds many of the screams were more racist than incident related (immigration and progressive europe - yeiy). throughout i just kept silent and head down as about thirty people by now were surrounding me (still triangled by arnie, sly, and miyagi) so that my voice would have drowned anyway.

after about another 5 minutes which felt like an eternity the golden opportunity arrived. i think sly took some pity with me and signaled a countdown with his left hand so only i could see and pointed into his direction. i am no fighter but i took one class of wing chun back in high school and in a spark of genius it all came back to me that moment. 'trap the dragon's head, the tail bites - trap the tail, the head bites'. as sly got down to his last finger i do the kung fu twist with my arm, break miyagi's iron grip around my wrist and start dashing towards sly. for a split second i thought i'd run into a muscle wall for the second time this day but in the last moment, he moved his 300 lbs. out of a way with the swiftness of a ballerina (damn, i was impressed). and then the sprint of a lifetime started. i was powell, bolt, and blake at the same time. i ran like my butthole depended on it (well it kinda did). luckily the mob never bothered to stand behind arnie and sly cause they figured i'd never get past them, so i didn't actually have to tackle anyone on my escape (no potential assault charges - yeiy) and continued down the road. i see some people follow me (pretty sure they had no clue about the chestnut but they just thought i was somehow involved) so i kept running and i had a good 100 m head start. i was just in front of my apartment block when i had the second spark of genius of the day - there was no way i would show them where i lived, so i ran for another 10 min further than any man has run ever before (about 2 km) until i reached a park to lie down. i was pretty sure that i lost most people when i passed my flat (thank god for the heat) but i had to be sure.

i cool down and call my neighbour who's flat looks down on the junction. i told her the whole story (she's a super old family friend) and she couldn't believe i was the guy sprinting away (she was sunning on her terrace). turns out the motorcyclist got up without injury and the blue and red car drivers weren't harmed either. according to my neighbour the cops and ambulance were called and they took down the details of all drivers, moved the blue car and treated the two pedestrians for about an hour, while all traffic was stopped.

something i didn't realise from my pov was that a second mob formed simultaneously around the motorcyclist after the crash who blamed him for everything, cause it looked like he just couldn't drive… and guess what - he was a foreigner - so that box was checked. his insurance will probably cover everything (at least that's what my conscience tells me).

i haven't left my flat of fear being recognised at the supermarket, my gf was a bit pissed that i made frozen pizza, and i promised myself to never kick a chestnut again.

tl:dr kicked a chestnut, distracted a motorcyclist, got out of hand and caused a crash, got blamed by a lot of clueless people, escaped running

edit: submitted this around midnight and went to bed to wake up to a blowing up inbox. thanks guys. also thank you so much for the gold. i put somewhere in the comments that excessive humour is my coping mechanism to deal with things. i apologise if that style really wasn't your jam and will work on semantics for the future. if you did enjoy it, you're welcome - we probably could make great friends in rl. and yes english is not my mother tongue, and i lived all around so that's why my units of space and mass are very all over the place.

"by getting so high i thought i predicted my own death. this happened last night in a 420-legal state, so no laws were broken in the making of this tifu. burner because reasons.

after taking a break from smoking for a few months, i decided to break out an indica-hybrid vape cartridge i bought a while ago and let the good times roll. i've been hitting it the past few days, and each time i get higher than a kite because my tolerance is so low now and i don't know when to stop hitting it.

i was on facebook yesterday morning when i was sober, and in one of my meme groups saw a screenshot of a post about a 23-year-old college student who died after eating pasta that had been left out five days. the top comment on it was ""he pasta way,"" and that just stuck with me because it was so funny.

later that night, i was cleaning out my fridge and came across two containers of food i had brought back with me from home (i'm a college senior and the semester started two weeks ago). one of the containers was a tortellini salad, and i noticed it had a ""sell by"" date of four days before. i was about to throw it out, then decided to smell it and try a piece given the proximity of the sell by date. i had one piece of tortellini, decided it might be alright, and put it back to figure it out later.

a few hours later, the high times have come and i'm hitting my vape pen. after watching a rodney dangerfield classic, i go up to bed and am lying there when all of a sudden i start feeling a sense of doom. i start imagining every hypochondriac symptom in the book, from chest pain, to stomach pain, to shortness of breath, etc. 

at the same time, all i could see in my head was ""he pasta way"" and started thinking that i was an almost 23-year-old college senior and i ate pasta that was approximately five days expired. i suddenly realized that i never saw the guy's name or where it happened in the screenshot, and started freaking out thinking it was about me. shortly thereafter the emt side of me takes over, checks that i have a pulse when i've pretty much convinced myself my heart has stopped, and i basically run an out-of-body patient assessment on myself to make sure i'm alive. i fell asleep, and just woke up after 12 hours.

tl;dr got so high i thought i had seen my own death before it happened",4
"by going on my first date in years. so usual disclaimer, this happened last week not today but i've only just recovered enough to talk about it. 

also for context i am a detective with the police which was on my profile.

so i have been single a few months now and finally decided to give those tinder style apps a go. i was recommended bumble by a colleague which is essentially just tinder but bee themed.

i downloaded the app thursday and by friday i had a date so i thought things were going well. first date i arrange for saturday at a busy shopping centre.

now i've been out of the dating game for a while and we were chatting about movies so we went to go to the cinema to see mortal engines.

i knew the first greeting was always going to be awkward, the whole ""hey is that x? 《you now have 1 second to decide on kiss on cheek, awkward hug or lame wave thing》 but what happened was none of those things. instead i get hit with "" tell me who you are i need to verify you"" which not going to lie is as romantic a greeting as smearing yourself with marmite and announcing ""let's have a toast for the pretty lady!""

anyway she then asks ""what's that on the floor"" pointing to a large pile of dust. it's a pile of dust i tell her and she makes me double check.

dust confirmed we move on to the cinema and purchase tickets the announcer in my brain exclaimes 《you are now locked into the date》

we got an hour and a half till the movie so we grab some ice cream cause that's cute as shit and head to starbucks (which fyi is a crowded mutherflucker) grab a table and she leans close... zero chill just dead pan asks me ""...what's the darkest job you have ever dealt with..."" 

now i've got some h.p. lovecraft dark stories so i try to give her a pg version of a double murder i had some involvement with. (note: everything i discussed could also be easily read about online)

""how did he kill them? was there a lot of blood? did you see it? was it like the movies? i love murder stories, have you seen making a murderer? have you heard about x murder? did you know this one guy once chopped his mum's head off and had sex with the corpse isn't that facinating?!?!""

(let me just remind you it's as crowded as balls in leather pants in this coffee shop and people are looking over)

she also hits me with a few probing questions ""have you ever committed a crime? have you ever done drugs?!""

trying to recover some semblance of a date i joke ""haha only if you count downloading showbox as a crime""

next it's my turn to ask some questions and throw out the classic ""tell me about your self"" (i know it's lame but i panicked)

""oh i've just been released from 18 months locked up in a psyche ward in broadmoor, it was pretty much a doss and i got to meet people like naked phillip""

now gripped with what can only be described as the terror a double d breasted woman feels in a slasher flick i decide i have two choices.

1) run into the crowd and disappear

2) continue date (what could go wrong in a cinema? it's just 2 hours of awkward silence)

let's just say i chose poorly...

before we move off though she asks me to search her chair... i don't really do much except say it's fine but after walking off she decides my efforts were not good enough and goes back to search it properly.

finally into the cinema now 10 minutes after start time so it's adverts but most people have sat down... of course there are people in our seat, what looks like a family of 14 parts like the red sea so we can sit in the seats we paid for but they are somewhat miffed.

suddenly my date whips out the flashlight on her phone and starts search the chair! the woman from the family is also some nutbar and starts yelling ""my eyes! turn off that light!! arrghhfyfbifwyh""

my date sits down in darkness for a whole 5 minutes before deciding that she wants to have a round two of flashlight rodeo.... cue raging snickers lady ""i'm going to knock you out i told you turn that light off"" 

i'm not about to white knight defend this woman, i'm a god damn spectator here! the fruit and nut villain is eventually calmed down by her fella.

date goes for lucky number 3 flashlight gamble, this time i have to step in and say thus is not ok.

so movie time. i'm sure mortal engines is a fine film... but it's pretty out there and loooong. all i'm thinking about is the 3 pieces of advice i was given prior to app dating

1) don't get drunk
2) don't send dick pics
3) don't stick your dick in crazy 

so despite the horror movie mortal engines has become i am still a man and she is still an attractive woman so i'm repeating number 3) again and again in my head like a monk trying to achieve enlightenment. lucky the date is so bad and my fear so palpable that logic wins out.

after the movie she goes to the bathroom and hands me her coat and bag, can't run yet... got to wait...

she returns dead serious ""i need you to follow me""

this is where i die i think, i'm being lured to the bathroom to be filleted like a fish and used as a skin suit in some crazy sex game.

she walks me to an isolated area and points at an especially large pile of dust

""what's that?""

i say just a large pile of dust ""are you sure, can you check"" 

sure enough it's just dust...

so keen to make good my escape i lay down a ""woah look at the time... 8:30! got to grab that train"" she responds ""you know i'm really thirsty... could really go for a drink!""

not willing to be the 3rd party to a human centipede i push on ""central line that's me! oh you too? great..."" 

next she smashes out a ""you know the overground train for me is an hour wait.... i don't really want to wait an hour... so thirsty..."" 

the next stop i just decided the wrong station was the right place to be, ""oh look at this! haha my stop lovely to meet you bye"" 

the journey home was the most paranoia driven thriller of my 29 years...

my first date in years was with someone murder obsessed and recently released from a mental health facility. now too scared to date anyone ever again.",4
"by losing track of where my dog is.. throwaway account so imma get very pissed if this gets a lot of points.

so i live with my family and my dog spends her nights in my room which means walking her in the mornings is usually my responsibility. this morning (obligatory this actually happened today) i went downstairs and open the door to let the dog out first before putting on shoes and grabbing my keys, in case she was bursting to go (i got up quite late since i graduated high school and pretty much just lounge about helping out at home) she can do it outside rather than in the house. by the time i'd gotten ready though the dog was nowhere to be seen.

now i wasn't too concerned since she can't get past the locked gate, so i knew she wasn't lost. after searching the garden i figured she must have done what she needed to do, and snuck back in to get another nap in (she's a lazy pupper). i went back inside and, since the rest of the house was still asleep (or so i thought), i didn't want to yell for her, so i resorted to check each room.

so the sleeping arrangements in my family is kind of unusual. i have a small sister who doesn't like to spend the night alone, so she chooses a parent to spend the night with in the double bed, while the remaining parent is ""banished"" to her room with the twin size bed, i get my own room. after checking the dog is not in mine or the small bedroom, i figured she'd gone to snuggle with my sister and dad in the big bedroom, so i went in to drag her out because _dammit_ i was determined to get my morning walk.

in i went, and it took me about 30 seconds to realise my mistake: the silhouette in the single bed had been way too small to be my mum. they must have gotten up, carried my sleeping sister to her own room, my mum snuck in with my dad, because there they were, on the double bed, _going at it_

turns out 30 seconds wasn't fast enough to piece the story together because just as i realised and panicked and tried to leave, my mum looks up and we make solid eye contact while i'm pretty sure my dad's dick was still inside her (not that i was keen to verify or think about it). i was catatonic as this point and my brain shut down and i just turned on my heels and left, with a deadpan expression this whole time.

my sister is no longer allowed to sleep in the big bedroom. and yes, turns out the dog was indeed in the room at the time.

tl;dr: let my dog slip into my parent's bedroom, went in to get her, broke my 18 years streak of managing to avoid catching my parents in the act of producing more siblings for me.

edit: let the records show that the first thing i did after getting tf out of that room was to check on my sister (who was awake by this time) and tell her to leave our parents alone for a while.",4
"by smeagoling at my new job. this happened today. about 20 minutes ago, to be more precise.

i just started a new job about a month ago. it's a quiet office environment. i only really know the people immediately around me, but everyone's been super nice to me so far.

one of the things i love about this place is they have a bunch of free breakfast stuff in the break room. this morning i thought a bagel sounded nice so i went to go toast one up. this is where the fu begins. 

i separated the bagel into two halves and went to put it in the toaster. i've only ever owned peasant toasters, but this stainless-steel bad boy had all the bells and whistles, including a ""bagel"" setting. i figured it wouldn't hurt so i punched it and waited. 

while i stood there my mind began to drift. i started thinking about lord of the rings for some reason, specifically trying to figure out when my kids would be old enough for me to introduce them to it. i heard the door to the break room shut and assumed the only person who had been in there with me had just left.

then the toaster dinged and my bagel popped up. i took it out and was struck by how amazingly it had toasted. warm and soft on the outside, toasted perfection on the inside. i started spreading the butter, still admiring the flawless bagel in my hands. my brain was still in fantasy mode though, and i said to myself in full-on smeagol voice, ""oooh yes! we likes it! gives it to us golden and crispy!""

at this point, my rational brain kicked back in and i realized how fucking weird i can be sometimes. oh well, no big deal. i take my bagel and turn around, nearly running into a group of ladies looking at me like i just arrived from another planet. i tried to give a polite smile, but i'm sure the surprise and wave of awkwardness i was experiencing made that creepy too. i shuffled past them and am now hiding at my desk. i'm sure it's just a matter of time before ""the new guy"" is rebranded as ""the multiple personality weirdo who talks to himself."" shit.

tl;dr talked like smeagol while buttering my bagel and was overhead by my new coworkers. instant shame.",4
"always disconnect bluetooth. so yesterday the alternator on my car died, i went and picked up a new one today that i'm going to install this weekend. no biggie, but it meant i had to borrow my dads truck to go to work today. now my dad has a newer pickup with a bluetooth radio, so i synched my phone up, put on some music and went to work. 

later, once i went home i decided to have some ""me"" time and watch some ""special video's"". around the 4th video when i was really getting into it, the audio suddenly cut off. puzzled, it took me a few seconds to realized the horror of what had happened.... my dad turned his truck on to go check the mail and was greeted with a full volume, near orgasm, porn moan when he did. 

when he got home, i was standing in the kitchen and awkwardly made eye contact with him and died a little inside. all he said was ""what the fuck son"". 

tl:dr- i borrowed my dads truck and synched my phone to it. went home and watched porn and my dad was greeted with the sound of a moaning porn-star when he started his truck

"by being so pregnant i couldn't see what i was wearing before i went on stage. this just happened a couple of hours ago. i am 8 months pregnant and *huge*. so i am in the choir at my church, and we were singing a special christmas song, so everyone was supposed to dress festively. i also had to sing a solo before the message, which i was *very* nervous for. 

i picked out a nice red maternity dress with beading on the collar and wore black tights with black velvet kitten heels. i even painted my nails to match. 

the first service went smoothly... but when i got home, i noticed i had prominent underarm sweat showing on my dress. *great*, that's probably what everyone was staring at during my solo, lol. so i was determined to prevent this from happening in the second service an hour later. i took off the dress, dried it off, and changed into some pajamas to have breakfast. i also put on an undershirt and stuffed a bunch of tissues under my arms so i wouldn't sweat next time.

before i knew it, i was running a bit behind, so i put my dress and shoes back on and hustled out the door. i got to the church a minute before the service started and rushed out of my car. someone asked if it was too windy for me. we're in south florida, so i had no idea what they were talking about and continued rushing for the doors. 

unfortunately, the service began a moment earlier and the choir was already on stage. i grabbed my songbook and lumbered onto the stage from the middle aisle, to my place front and center with the other sopranos. everyone smiled at me awkwardly, which i figured was due to my tardiness.

we started with a hymn... that's when i realized i felt too much fabric around my legs for the kind of dress i was wearing. i worried that the tissues from my arms had fallen and people could see them stuck to my tights or something. i could not see past my belly easily, so i leaned over to check, as conspicuous as it was to do so...

the sight and accompanying horror took a moment to register. there they were, my pink and teal flamingo print pajama pants. still on my legs. and the whole audience sees them. how the freak did i not notice, and how did i get on stage without anyone telling me?!? 

i rushed off the stage mid-song and took the offending pants off in the bathroom, then waddled back up to my spot. i couldn't even run off afterwards and hide, because i had to sing a solo immediately after that! on the bright side, my stage fright for that was gone...

tldr: changed clothes in a hurry between performances at church. unintentionally sang on stage wearing flamingo pajama pants because i'm huge and can't see my legs. ",4
"by letting my husband show me something interesting.. this just happened. i'm still trying to process....and to not pee my pants.

my husband went outside to put out the trash, since its midnight he wore a head lamp. he comes back inside looking a little pale but also like he found something really cool. 

turns out he read somewhere on reddit that you can see a spider's eye shine in the grass. he told me about it and said it was interesting. 

now here's the fuck up. i asked him to show me.  i should probably mention that i have arachnophobia. like legit pee my pants, cry, throw my kids out of my way while i run for my life arachnophobia. i thought i could handle it. i thought it would be one sparkly reflection. i thought it would be ok cuz i wouldn't actually *see* a spider. 

i was wrong.

so very very *very* wrong. there had to be hundreds of spider eyes reflecting back at me. i'm not sure how i made it back in the house but i was told screaming was involved. now i'm terrified of leaving my house. 

tldr spiders. arachnophobia.  never leaving my house again.

hokywowbatman now i know what rip my inbox means. i never thought this post would get any views. so.....

1. thank you everyone for the advice on getting therapy, i will definitely follow up on it. i do not want to live this way.

2. phobia is an *irrational* fear. if i could ""grow the fuck up"" and ""get over it"" and ""stop being such a baby"" and all the other unhelpful comments that were sent to me, believe me i would. who wants to be scared of a thing that is teeny tiny compared to you.

"by being too good at my job. so this has happened over the last month and half coming to a head yesterday.

&#x200b;

i started a new job, admin, about a month and a half ago. i do pretty basic administrative work: check deposits, filing, follow ups, etc. it's a full time gig, and it might take me half of the day to do all my duties. i don't know who had this job last, but they fucked around a lot. i try to fuck around and i still get things done super fast. this has led to frustration for me and my supervisor because i run out of things to do, and i have to interrupt her work so she can find things for me to do.

&#x200b;

btw, i am not the kind of person where i enjoy getting paid to do nothing. sure, it's nice on occasion, but not half of the day every single day.

&#x200b;

fast forward to yesterday: i ask my supervisor if there was anything i could work on, and she asks me to shut her door. she asks me how i feel about getting my hours cut. not just by a few hours. she's thinking me being there 25 hours per week! that's significant.

&#x200b;

moral of the story: don't do your best because you will get punished for it.

&#x200b;

tl:dr i did my job too well and got my hours cut for it

&#x200b;

edit: thank you to everyone on the ""real world"" advice. it does suck, but that's the way it goes, i suppose. my boss called me into his office to talk about the situation. he firstly apologized for suggesting hours being cut before they had a game plan. he made it very clear that he and the company appreciates my work ethic and initiative and that they do not want to lose me as an employee. apparently, when they hired me on there was originally going to be more work duties for me, but for some reason out of his control, that didn't happen. they are going to merge me into another area so i can fulfill a normal working week, not have hours cut, and most importantly keep my pay.

"by accidentally taking my boyfriend on his nightmare date.. full disclosure, this happened several years ago (and he is now my ex boyfriend), but something made me remember this story today.

my ex-boyfriend was a big fan of grand gestures and surprise dates. he took me to all kinds of cool stuff to surprise me, like an obon festival, a special old school star trek movie showing, an art museum, even a surprise interstate road trip on my birthday! for his birthday, i resolved to pay him back with his own nice surprise. we had been together for \~10 months at that point, so i thought i knew what would suit him: a picnic at a beautiful outdoor conservatory, a walk around the zoo, and the surprise: tickets to a butterfly conservatory, basically a glass dome filled with lush greenery, flowers, and hundreds of butterfly species flying freely. (not this specific one, but this video gives you an idea what it's like)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lemo5o46rso)

i had always gone to the butterfly house with my family as a little kid and i loved it soooooo much. it was special to me and i was so excited to share it with him.

he was having a great time walking around with me by the lakes and at the picnic. i kept hyping him up, saying ""i can't wait until the final surprise, i hope you love it! you're going to love it!""

we got to the entrance, they tore our tickets, and i led him in belle-at-the-library-in-beauty-&-the-beast style. i still won't shut up, trying to get him hyped. finally, the moment of truth: i took my hands off his eyes and watched him behold the kaleidoscopic beauty surrounding him.

immediately, his face blanched and he looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach.

he was cowering and clinging to my arm when a butterfly flew past him.

""umm... are you ok, dear?""

""i'm.... fine..."" he said with a classic hide the pain harold grimace.

""you don't seem fine. did something happen?""

he looked ill and muttered ""why would people pay to go to a place people let disgusting bugs land on them"". i must have looked hurt because he tried to pull himself together, put on a brave face, and grabbed my arm tight. before we could even get going any further, he pulled away from me and started shouting ""oh god, it's in your hair, it's in your hair."" before i could even tell what was going on, he had tried to run out the exit with employees chasing him, calling ""wait! we have to check you for stowaway butterflies!"" it was chaos. kids were watching him from their strollers. some were screaming and crying. 

when i finally caught up with him, he had thrown up in the trash can by the duck pond. i apologized profusely and he said it wasn't my fault - his fear of moths/butterflies just hadn't come up in conversation yet. i couldn't have known.

we just kind of stared blankly at the pond until he said, ""let's just go home."" 

it took me months before i felt comfortable trying to surprise him again, and surprise surprise, i managed to screw that up too. (it's the nightmare redux: thai surprise in the comments)

tl;dr: i accidentally traumatized my moth-phobic now-ex-boyfriend by enclosing him in a space with hundreds of butterflies. 

edit: sorry, i accidentally deleted like half this post trying to edit it. dang. i hope i cobbled it back together properly. 

1. please don't be mean, phobias are irrational by definition. it's not his fault. 
2. i was really dumb and young in this story and i don't try to surprise people anymore (unless it's something they explicitly said they wanted). i thought it was fair game to try to share something from my childhood because he had taken me to a mediocre fargo pizza place that was his favorite childhood restaurant just a few weeks earlier. 

he did also have surprise cheesecake waiting for him when he got back (favorite dessert), so at least the day wasn't destroyed completely.",4
"by going commando. **for the record: the girl i'm seeing encouraged me to create an actual account to share this fuck up. i have read some crazy ass stories on here so, uh, it's hard to tell if this post will even come close to the standard of this sub.** 

*shrug*

**s'up.**

this happened last weekend. 

i went to my friend's house party wearing nothing but my panda onesie. i thought underwear would be overkill since it gets so damn hot in that thing. so, i eliminated the unnecessary layers and went commando. oof. it was freeing. the penis was a swingin' and the balls was a breathin'. pure cock flopping fun i tell thee. and so... off i go... with a hop and skip... and a bouncing dick. 

cut to me and this cute girl grinding on the dance floor. her ass was rubbing against me so fucking hard, it triggered **the boner.** aw, fuuuck! it's gonna stick out like a sore thumb underneath this damn onesie. i literally spin her ass around so it doesn't touch my dick no more. worst. fucking. mistake. this girl, in the heat of the moment, rips open my onesie, exposing my bare boner for all to see. as if that wasn't bad enough, my dick *fucking flexes* right before i cover up. folks there lost their shit. dick jokes, drunken laughter, cat-calls & whistles, all erupted in that moment. i questioned so many life choices as i stood there, frozen and flustered as fuck. 

for the rest of that night i had to dodge a mob of wasted degenerates on a mission to rip me open. the motherfuckers called it the panda challenge.

"by accidentally submitting a suicide note as my essay for english class. so this happened yesterday, and i've yet to see what the results of my stupidity are

it is important to know that i was suicidal a year or so ago. i still have depression and anxiety though. also, this is a high school, and my school takes mental health **very seriously**.

so for my english class, i required to write an essay responding to a prompt on the list of prompts my teacher gave me. i decided to do the ""3 stages of life"" one, but instead of the classic ""birth, life, and death"" stages, i made the stages of my life ""bliss, pain, unknown.""  for bliss i wrote about my childhood and how nice it was to be a lil kid. for pain, i write about how depressed i got during high school and how i wake up everyday and think about how badly i want to die. then for unknown, i wrote about how peaceful everything would probably be after i die. i said i was looking forward to my death too. once i finished, i submitted it online without even reading through the whole thing once because i was right up against the deadline for submission

so fast forward to me, in my english class, about to read this essay out loud in front of a few of my classmates because we were supposed to ""peer review"" each other's essays. i read mine, and realized that it low key sounds like a suicide note. the people in my peer review group were shocked, and they tried to talk me out of killing myself (i never said i would kill myself, and i have no intention of doing so, but i did say in the essay that i was looking forward to dying, and i guess that made them think imma kill myself)

so now im just sitting there thinking to myself ""shit i just read a suicide note to my classmates! please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone""

so now im pretty sure that my teacher's gonna read my essay and tell somebody about my mental health, or even worse, she might tell my parents

"(update!!) deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.. amidst the hate and questioning of my sexuality, there was actually some fantastic advice in the original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c5toeo/tifu_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my_new/). i came into the office today with a pretty clear idea of what i was going to say. i felt okay with myself, but holy shit the closer i got, the more fucking petrified i became. the walk from the front door to the edit bay was a total blur, i felt like i was going to have a heart attack. i kept going back in my head whether or not it was better if she was already in the office or if i was in there first, and maybe if i was first it would seem more intimidating. my mind was going nuts. i got back to the edit bay and peaked in and she was already there, and turned around and saw me kind of creeping in. just a fucking horrible way to start this.

&#x200b;

then, i proceeded to absolutely butcher my eloquently preplanned speech. i honestly wish i could tell you all exactly what i said but i really don't remember. i know i apologized, i said something along the lines of each of us probably don't want to ever have to look at each other again, and i did say that if she felt uncomfortable being here, i'd be happy to help her find another job. she asked if i wanted her to leave and i said of course not.

&#x200b;

she was kind of looking down the whole time and after i finished my word vomit, she just kind of shook her head and said ""what are the fucking odds."" we both started laughing and i came a bit more back to reality and asked again if she was comfortable working together and she said she was. we agreed it might take a while to actually look at each other but luckily our desks have us back to back, ugh.

&#x200b;

i got coffee and came back and she had music on and we kind of worked for a few without speaking but the mood was definitely lighter. then she asked if she could ask me a few questions. ohhh boy, lol, but sure.

* when did i learn i could do this?
* have i ever done this for a crowd before?

and of course...

* does it feel like sucking dick or getting your dick sucked?

and..

* are you bi? do you think it's kind of gay?

&#x200b;

i obliged, i think being back to back helped us talk it out and kind of laugh about it.

&#x200b;

i asked her how long she has known my friend for. (they met in college). she said that she has always been a bit crazy and a bit of a freak. she said when she told her that this guy she was dating could suck his own dick, she was not at all surprised. i got the feeling this wasn't the first bizarre scenario she had gotten her in.

&#x200b;

i really wanted to ask her if she enjoyed herself but i was worried it was teetering on sexual harassment and honestly working in such close quarters i don't think i want to know the answer.

&#x200b;

so there you have it.

&#x200b;

oh and no, i do not know if she's on reddit. i felt like asking would have drawn attention to it, but there was no mention of my post or anything like that.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i did my best, she did hers, it's awkward but it'll all be okay.

&#x200b;

edit:  okay, i'll answer the questions.

i learned with my girlfriend in college.  we were very experimental, and somehow it led to this.  it's been a party trick of mine, lol, since.

&#x200b;

never done it for a crowd before, no.

&#x200b;

(from the original post)

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts. no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before. pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex. it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward. by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

&#x200b;

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement. a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off. kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc. i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice. but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful. better than jerking off that's for sure.

&#x200b;

edit 2:  guys, ""party trick"" is just a saying.   this is the only party i have ever done this.

&#x200b;

edit 3:  no, there are no videos or photos.  but if you live in la i might give you a private show if you can somehow make my life more awkward.",4

"by having a stress-induced orgasm in a public library.. throwaway account because my dignity.

obligatory this happened during midterms in october. i just haven't had a chance to write about it until now.

this is going to be a long one, but i feel this story requires a certain degree of explanation before reaching the climax (no pun intended).

i'm a 26-year-old woman in a rather intensive graduate program. to put it in perspective, grad programs in this field typically take two years to complete, but the one i'm enrolled in is a one-year program. so right of the bat, i'm completing two years' worth of coursework in one. secondly, i'm now at a fairly prestigious university after having completed my undergrad at a not-so-great university. i always thought i had high standards for myself, but the expectations at this school are *much* higher than what i'm used to, and i still question all the time whether i'm actually good enough to be here. thirdly, i'm not so great at handling stress. i am working with a therapist through campus psychological services, but i'm not finding their approach to therapy particularly helpful. and since that's all i can afford right now with my insurance, that's the best i can get.

bottom line: i'm stressed out all the time. and midterms were *hell*: four hefty papers all due within three days of each other. now, three of those papers weren't so bad. they took a while to write, but at least i knew what i was writing. paper number four, however… guys, this paper fucked me *hard*. this paper fucked me like i've never been fucked in my whole life. and i'm in an english-related field, so believe me, i am *not* used to getting fucked by papers. i won't bore you with the details, but in a nutshell, the paper required that we read a pool of approximately 30-40 journal articles and write a paper on their characteristics. (to be fair, we had from mid-august to mid-october to complete this assignment, so given the timespan, it *was* doable.) now, if i were to write a list of all the reasons why this paper threw me off, i'd end up with a dissertation. in the limited space i have, i can't fully explain why this paper was so hard, so please just believe me when i tell you it was *hard*. yes, even though i'd spoken to the professor about it a few times. and it was worth about a third of my grade.

anyway, this big bastard was due on a monday, so i brought myself to the library on friday, determined (after several failed attempts) to *at least* get an outline done. i tried for about 2.5 hours to draw up a plan to organize this thing, but for the life of me, i *could not* figure out how to cram all the required elements into a cohesive, logical argument, especially given the miniscule word count of the assignment (2,500 words maximum, when this paper *could* have been a fucking book). now, at this point, it's not that i was losing willpower or energy. no: the problem was that i was freaking out. i wanted to focus on this paper, but all my brain could do was assault me with a barrage of negative thoughts: *you're going to fail this paper and fail this class and lose your financial aid and drop out of school and be a huge failure to everyone because you suck…* you get the idea. and then, to make matters worse, my mental distress started to express itself physically; i *wanted* to keep writing, but my hands were shaking so much i could barely even hold my pen. my neck was stiff as a board, my head burned above my eyes, my back was spasming a little, and my heart was pounding like a fucking jackhammer. and then.

and *then*.

i've googled this and haven't really been able to find a satisfactory explanation for what happened next. but i'll recount the sensation as i experienced it. all of a sudden, i felt a *massive* rush of blood to my lower body. i can only guess this was some kind of adrenaline-related/fight-or-flight response. my entire bottom half suddenly felt as if it had been electrified: feet, legs… and lady bits. there i was, silently losing my mind in a library full of students studying for midterms, when out of the clear blue sky, my clit feels ready to burst.

i came before i even knew what was happening. it wasn't some screaming, thrashing affair, but i did convulse in my chair and ended up moaning a little out of sheer surprise. and yes, people *definitely* noticed; i was on the quiet-study floor, so the room had been *silent* up until that point. i don't think i was obvious enough that anyone would conclude i'd just had an orgasm in the library, but still… clearly *something* had happened. i packed my shit, went the hell home, and drank several screwdrivers at 2:00 in the afternoon.

as i said, i haven't really found a thorough explanation for this (though i haven't been searching too intensely). i have found the occasional anecdotal account of people having similar experiences. mostly, though, i've been finding articles about how stress and anxiety *inhibit* orgasm in women. for my part in this research, i state for the record that stress can, indeed, spiral so low that is sort of bursts through the other side and expresses itself as sexual ecstasy, whether you like it or not.

also, i got a 78 on the paper. but my professor assures me it won't end up tanking my grade.

tl;dr: i got so stressed that i came involuntarily in my university library. also, i may have masochistic tendencies and don't know who i am anymore.

edit: thank you all for your thoughtful responses, as well as for the silver and gold.

i'd just like to clarify on a couple of points that have been brought up: i did not procrastinate on this assignment. i completed the reading in a timely manner and gave myself plenty of time (more than a week) to write this paper. given the rigor of this program, that is *all* the time i could give myself to do it. the paper just never quite happened in an orderly, timely fashion because i was so confused and stressed out. normally i never put off things until the last minute. it just sort of happened this time because i had no idea what i was doing.

secondly, i am working with a therapist on my stress management techniques. i recently told my therapist that i'd like to do some more intensive work for managing stress, and she referred me to an off-campus therapist who will accept my insurance. hopefully, we'll be able to work together to figure out some solutions that work for me. again, i'm very grateful for all the advice and input! i'm really glad i could make you guys laugh. you all have made me laugh, as well!",4

by then i realized my idiocy had reached record levels and went to yank it off. the sucker was really on there, so i yank pretty hard before realizing what i was doing. i stop and peel at the edges and it comes off, but my fears had come true. i look in the camera again and i've got a huge purple hickey about 3"" in diameter right in the middle of my forehead. it also hurts a little bit. 

tl:dr i accidentally gave myself a hickey on my forehead with a sex toy",4
"by making a north korea joke to pay my power bill. today i learned that venmo takes the subject of your payment very seriously. 

every month when the power bill comes up, my roommate alerts us of in a comical manner. we've received the star wars title scrawl with the text reworded to describe the bill, the stranger things intro sequence, you get the idea. well this time i get a link to a subtitled north korean news broadcast, link here.(http://www.captiongenerator.com/731812/north-korea-power-bill) so naturally i send my roommate the money via venmo with the subject ""north korea is best korea.""

within seconds, i get a notification in the venmo app that my payment has been halted pending review by venmo's compliance department per office of foreign assets control (ofac) guidelines. there is a 48hr hold on the payment and i'm required to submit a statement of sorts explaining my payment. it's been about an hour and i've already had a phone call with the customer service department that can be summed up as ""can you not??"" 

it would seem that there is a list(http://gawker.com/the-words-that-will-get-you-in-trouble-on-venmo-1738331672) of words that will get you into trouble on venmo, but all the usual jokes about cocaine and hookers are good-to-go. it's been a fun morning.

tl;dr: paid power bill with subject ""north korea is best korea."" got flagged per office of foreign assets control (ofac) guidelines. still haven't been able to pay the power bill...

edit: here's the stranger things one he did for us last month: removed as it had our actual names on it

edit #2: and the star wars one: https://brorlandi.github.io/starwarsintrocreator/#!/akrfbcvls4jdf-qeekbw

edit #3: despite all this annoyance, venmo is still really useful and i'd recommend it. just avoid funding rogue states and terrorists while you pay for mundane items. it's hard, but i'm sure you can manage. 

edit #4: they let the payment go through. at least their cs dept is pretty quick on these things. i hope that video made someone's day at venmo. now back to funding rogue states and terrorist groups. my monthly payments to the kgb and isis are late...

edit #5: removed stranger things link due to personal info issues.

edit #6: looks like the link to the vid in question is currently kill. not sure if hug o' death or what. meh, just keep f5'ing. what could go wrong?

**edit #7: link is no longer kill. be gentle.**

edit #7: obligatory ""thanks for the gold kind stranger"" or whatever edit.

edit #8: proof for the doubters.(https://imgur.com/dqugywr)

edit #9: no mirror for the link available. my roommate whipped it up at his office and we don't have a local copy of it. hopefully the reddit hug ends soon enough for people to be able to view it. sorry :(",4
"by getting hulk hogan stuck to my foreskin. even though this happened over a decade ago, my family still occasionally roasts me for it.

back when i was around 9 or 10 my family bought me these toys for christmas(https://m.imgur.com/a/ad358js). as the pictures suggests, you could ""connect"" a figure's fists to anothers via the magnets on the fists themselves - which happened to be **really** strong.

you can probably see where this is going already... in my not-so-clever mind i wanted to see if i could connect the wrestlers to my foreskin. i remember stretching my foreskin with one hand whilst also holding one of the wrestlers fists against the stretched skin. then with my other hand i grabbed the other wrestler and slowly brought its fist closer to the foreskin where the other fist was sitting on the other side. **snap** i fell over and screamed in agonising pain, as not only were hulk hogan and goldberg stuck to my foreskin - they were pinching the end like a snapping turtle. 

hulk and goldberg held their grip while i screamed in pain. i tried pulling them apart but due to the pain or panick i just couldn't.

to my absolute embarrassment, my mum and dad rushed into the room and had to pull hulk and goldberg from my dick.

this story is still brought up at christmas dinners to this day.

tl;dr: got hulk hogan and goldberg action figures stuck to my dick via magnets and had to get my parents to remove them.",4
"for thinking of moving home because of a noise that was making me crazy. a few months ago i was lying in bed about to fall asleep, when i start to hear a noise that seems to come from upstairs.

the noise was like a bouncing ball falling. the ball began to fall from very high and the noise intensified as it began to approach the ground. then stop. and would come back again.

the sound was soft but very close.

i am someone who sleeps anywhere, anytime, in any position. i'm like chuck norris falling asleep but this was crazy. a sleep deprivation torture.

the sound continued for another 30 minutes and stopped. there were days when it kept going for an hour straight. days when nothing just happened. sometimes i heard it during the day which was almost equally horrible because i couldn't concentrate if i was reading or watching a movie. but he appeared mostly at bedtime.

this went on for over a month.

one night i was very tired and decided to go to bed early (9pm).

and of course there was that motherfucker again.

i did not think. i got out of bed, opened the apartment door and climbed the stairs to my upstairs neighbors.

so there i was. no bra. wearing a t-shirt with prehistoric spots. some pants with three sizes over mine. and with the classic trousers inside the socks for extra heat. with hair where any bird would proudly wear as a nest. and of course knee socks of different colors and sizes because everyone has a black hole sucking socks inside the washing machine. at this point in my decaying life, i didn't even bother to put my shoes on.

so there i was, climbing the stairs with nothing planned to say.

as i approached the door i could hear a lot of noise in their house. i ring the bell and a girl opens the door. everyone in that house came to see what was going on. they were all very well dressed, as if they had come from a wedding or something and visibly lightly drunk.

so there i was in the hallway explaining to a group of fancy drunk people that there is a noise ""like a falling bouncing ball"" coming from that apartment.

she tells me she has housemates but the room above mine is empty.

i still say that it is impossible. that the noise comes almost every day and it's been a month and i'm starting to go crazy.

she says she doesn't know where the noise might come from. there is nothing at home that can make a sound that i tried to mimic.

yes, i imitated a bouncy ball with different voices for a group of fancy drunk people.

so there i was, thinking as we talked that none of this was going to get resolved and most likely would have to move house until i say, without much thought, ""wanna go see it?""

so there we were, me and 8 other fancy drunk people in my small room quietly waiting for the noise to appear.

and of course, nothing happened.

i apologized to everyone, i took the fancy drunk people to the door and went to bed to spoon with my shame and retardness.

this was last week.

today a friend came here for the afternoon. while we were talking the wild noise appeared. i was hysterical.

""are you hearing this""

""yea...""

""i can no longer with this noise, i think i'll have to move house.""

""it comes from your warmer ...""

so my heater has two buttons. one to turn it on and one to change the temperature. and it seems that when the heater is off and the temperature button is in heat mode, it makes a weird noise that looks like a bouncing ball and the echo of the house sounds like it comes from upstairs.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i'm retarded.",4
"by sending a picture of my my sloppy poo to my evil boss and getting fired. nsfw. this happened on the day before christmas eve (the 23rd). i worked at a supermarket and as you can guess, just before christmas the store is absolutely hectic.

so on the night before christmas eve eve (22nd) i started having some pretty sloppy poos. throughout the night this case developed into a hole shitshow of sloppy shits. i was going back and forwards to the toilet all night and only managed to get a couple hours sleep. if i'm completely honest i'm surprised i didn't soil myself and i'm actually a little bit proud of the fact that i didn't. 

when morning came my sloppy poos were still at their height and showing no resistance, i really could not muster up the courage to go into work whilst the shits were at their peak. i knew that i would not last an hour working the cash register. if i were to try it would only result in two scenarios; me either sprinting to the toilet and looking a fool or the much more likely scenario of me shitting myself in public (one of my worst fears). i picked up my phone and called in sick.

just with my luck, my ass of a boss answered the phone. she's quite the bitch and to no surprise she was not too happy when i told her i would not be coming in. i am a good employee and from the few years of working at the store i've only had 1 or 2 days off (i very rarely get i'll), i assumed it wouldn't be too hard to get a day off. damn i was wrong. 

she started accusing me of faking an illness  and bitching out due me not wanting to come into a work due to it being one of the busiest days of the year.  she called me lazy and told me how i'm not a ""team player"". she called me many many names (which was completely unneeded) and expressed about 50,000 times how she did not believe that i was ill and how she just knew i was lying to get the day off. she told me how she was expecting to see me in work later. the whole time i was trying to keep my cool and trying to explain to her how i in-fact did have the shits and how it would definitely not be a good idea to come into work. she still refused to believe. 

little did she know i had just brewed up a pretty horrific poop. still on the phone i told her calmly and gently that if she did not believe me i would simply prove it to her. 

i hung the phone up and snapped a quick picture of the ass goblin i had produced. with no hesitation i proceeded to send the picture to my boss on facebook messenger then i and happily flushed the beast away. 

no more than a few minutes later i received a phone call from the boss where she in short told me how i was being fired. i guess she didn't really like the pic i sent her

if i'm honest i don't really care that she fired me. i was contemplating leaving anyway. she is definitely on my top five list of the biggest dicks i've met. but either way i really didn't want to get fired. 

tl;dr
i developed a pretty shitty case of diarrhoea on christmas eve eve. i could not possibly have gone into work (in a supermarket). i called the super mega bitch of a boss to let her know i won't be in. she refused to believe and accused me of lying. i sent her a picture of my shit and she fired me a few minutes later.

"by trying to have a threesome with my girlfriend.. so this happened last night. my girlfriend and i have been trying to have a threesome for a while now but could never really find the right girl. yesterday she reconnected with one of her old middle school friend and they were hanging out at the mall. she called me and asked if they could come by my place after for some drinks and i agreed.

they come over around 9pm and my girlfriend gave me that look. i knew that she talked to her about having a threesome with us and the girl agreed to it. so i play some music and bring out some drinks. everything is going good until she brings out her own stash of alcohol and weed.

the girl brought two 4locos and starts chugging. (for those who don't know 4locos is this really harsh alcoholic drink that's 4 servings of alcohol in one can that can really fuck you up.) she has two of them. then she rolls a blunt and smokes it. (i didn't drink or smoke at all) by that time my girlfriend is tipsy from the hennessy i have and starts making out with me. the girl is on the bed watching and obviously starts getting turned on. but a few minutes later she told us she's really tired and wants to go back home. i'm bummed out but we all get in the car and i drive her home.

i'm driving her home down these dark back roads. the whole time she's telling us how she loves having us as friends and that she's sorry for being so tired and all that. then she starts gagging and making pre vomit sounds i guess? anyways i pull over to the side of the road so she can do her business. she gets out and starts sprinting down the road (rip me) i start chasing her down the the dark road and i catch up. she looks me dead in the face and asked me who i was. i told her i'm her friend and that she's not feeling well and my girlfriend and i was taking her home. she's says ok but continues to walk away and a car goes by. she waves her arms and screams for help and i grab  her saying wtf are you doing? then she bites the shit out my hand. i let go and she runs into the street. i'm a black guy with dreads and she's a skinny white girlfriend so the sight of me chasing her is pretty comical. she managed to flag down a truck, a man and wife, and begs them for help. my girlfriend pulled up and very calmly told her friend to get back in the car. the girl screamed get away from me hides in the bush. the couple calls the police. the police showed up and asked everyone questions and took the girl back to her parents place.

no sex was had but instead i got a few cuts from the bite so that's kinda kinky i guess.

tl:dr- girlfriend comes over with her friend for a threesome. friend gets drunk and high instead and runs away. friend freaks out and bites my hand and strangers calls the police. police takes her home

update- i'm going to go to the clinic soon to have it checked and i'm going to try and upload pictures as well. my girl friend tried to get in contact with the girl but no response. we'll stop by her apartment along the way

update 2- here's my hand(https://imgur.com/a/v6pw3gc) 

edit- i'm light skinned black like caramel or peanut butter lmao

"by not locking my dogs out of the room during sex. so this just happened last night. i should start by saying i have two wonderful, loving big dogs, a gsd and a lab mix. usually when my fiance and i start getting ready to rock and roll we lock them out of the bedroom to avoid any distractions. 

last night however he woke me up around 1am to have a little midnight fun (he must've been having a good dream). i was about it, we started in, and let the good times roll. it was all going per usual, he was done, i was making my steady climb up the hill to heaven. my eyes were closed and i was not being very quiet. right as i was about to start my journey back down to earth i feel a long wet tongue on my face. open my eyes, my gsd is standing in my face looking worried and trying to kiss me. 

let me tell you, there is no quicker turn off and end to a climax then getting kissed in the mouth by your slobbery dog. i pushed my dog away and my fiance just burst into tears from laughing so hard. 

tl;dr we started having sex in the middle of the night, forgot about the dogs. my gsd snuck up and mouth kissed me at my climax and ruined my night. 

edit: i can't believe the most popular reddit post i will ever have is about this... thank you strangers for silver and platinum! also thank you to everyone who shares these experiences and so sorry to those who have gotten tongues to the butt... you win? 

edit 2: gsd (german shepard dog) for those of you angry about this, thank you for commenting and bringing my karma up even higher. also for those of you confused about the whole process, just because my fiance was finished doesn't mean he didn't help a girl out. ",4
"by drinking peanut butter. quick statement, this isn't my account, but u/thegemscout is a close friend of mine and since i don't use reddit i figure someone should get the karma, if you guys happen to enjoy my pain. (also, this was about a week ago, not today sadly)

so lets preface this. there's an episode of two & a half men where jake melts a jar of peanut butter into liquid, then he offers charlie some. 

so i'm at my friend's house, let's call the friend mason, and we're watching reruns of the show. we see that fatefull scene and mason thinks it'd be a good idea to dare me to drink peanut butter. 

two things before we proceed:

1. our dares are intense, but we never refuse them.

2. while it's apparently weird, i despise peanut butter, not that i'm allergic or anything, but i really hate the stuff.

knowing that refusing the dare is not an option (or else i'm going to get pranked to no end over it) i decide we should just get it over with now.

so my friend hands me the tallest coffee  mug he owns and says ""get to scooping"" while he laughs in my face

once he's made me fill the cup with peanut butter, he puts in in the microwave for like 1:30 seconds and then motions for me to get the cup before it hardens. here's where my fuckup begins:

i drink coffee often, so i'm not very careful about it being hot, and assume it's much much cooler than my typical coffee as i heat that up for about 2 minutes or more before i drink it. 1 minute is nothing to me, and seeing as i'm not trying to taste this disgusting flavor of nutty origin, i try to slam it down as fast as possible.

actually the biggest mistake of my life, as not only does peanut butter heat up much faster than a typical liquid, it's very thick and insanely sticky. it was like satan came in my mouth but it was stuck there and i couldn't get it out. my friend is still laughing his ass of and i'm screaming at the top of my lungs as it goes further into my throat and i begin choking on the molten shit-liquid itsself. at this level i'm thinking ""i'm choking on lava"" and ""i really hope i don't die because of the one time i eat peanut butter""

in my suffering i finally stammer out ""take me to the er"" and his face immediately changed
 
i go for the milk we have in the fridge so i can walk out the door, but lucky me; we have not one drop of milk, nor any other liquid other than fucking a1 sauce, so i grab the sprayer in the kitchen sink and start blasting it in my mouth so as to mitigate the damage, but i can already tell that i've got some pretty severe burns.

flash forward to the hospital, and thanks to my idiocy i have second degree burns all over my mouth and throat, and after almost a week, i'm still in constant pain. i can't taste anything except pain, i have burns on and around my tongue, my gums the roof of my mouth, my throat, and can barely sleep due to the intensity of the pain.

fml, and fuck peanut butter. never drink it, or you'll end up like me.


tl;dr: got dared to drink melted peanut butter. slammed it down to avoid taste. hot peanut butter is basically napalm and hot pb + mouth = second degree burns.",4
"by accidentally making my friend's parents think i was having lesbian sex with their daughter. obligatory this didn't happen today, but i was talking to my friend and remembered about this whole ordeal and thought i'd share.

this happened a few months ago, and for context, me and my friend are both 17 and female, and importantly one of our female friends had just come out as gay at the time. this meant that my other friend (the one who this is about, who i'll call h) had told her parents that one of her female friends was gay, but hadn't specified which one (important later).

so one day h invited me over to watch a film after school. when i arrived i said hi to her parents then went upstairs with h to her bedroom to watch the film. this is where the fuck up slowly started. first of all we closed the door, which is something that we never do when i visit her, but was important as we were watching a film and didn't want to be disturbed by her parents. then we turned the light out, again, uncharacteristic for us but important for watching a film. we really didn't think much about either of these things.

anyway, an hour later we were talking and laughing with the film in the background. now this is where i really fucked up, i was being uncharacteristically funny and was talking in a kinda flirty, sexual voice which one of the characters in the film had sounded like. h found this really funny so i continued with it and only spoke with that voice for a good 10 minutes or so, and we were both quietly laughing a lot. at some point during this time i heard her parents walk past the door but neither of us though much about it. some more important information to know is that h is asexual (meaning that she doesn't experience sexual attraction and doesn't want to have sex), and her parents don't know this about her because she doesn't like to talk to them about that kind of thing. this means that i constantly forget that most people don't know this about her.

another 20 mins past and then we heard footsteps and soft knocking on the door. we thought this was strange as they're the kind of parents to barge into a room without announcing their presence. h shouted at them to just come in the room and then we heard the sliding of paper under the door. we were very confused and just watched this piece of paper awkwardly sliding and then heard footsteps walking away. h picked up the paper and it said ""we're going to get mcdonalds for dinner do you want anything?"".

we were both seriously confused about why they had felt the need to tell us via paper, in such an awkward way rather than just opening the door to ask. then it dawned on me and i turned to h and asked her ""do your parents think we were fucking?"", at first she looked at me with a look of confused disgust, wondering why the hell i had said that, then slowly her expression turned to that of horror and realisation. we had closed to door, turned of the lights, had been quietly giggling, i had been talking in a flirty voice for an extended period of time... not to mention the fact that neither one of us can sit still for more than 10 seconds so there had certainly been lots of bed creaking and sheet rustling sounds. also her parents knew that one of her two female friends was gay just didn't know which one it was, and didn't know that their daughter was asexual so would never want to have sex anyway.

we immediately turned the lights on and opened the door, but by then it was too late. when we went downstairs to say what we wanted from mcdonald's her parents couldn't look either one of us in the eye, and were talking to us really awkwardly. after the mcdonalds i left and h spent a lot of time subtly clearing it up with her parents, such as mentioning the name of the friend who was gay, and bringing up that i had a boyfriend (which her parents didn't know about). i think they realised that they had got it wrong but those moments of awkwardness were horrific. luckily all has been fine since, but now whenever we meet up we make sure to keep the door open.

tl;dr went round to a female friend's house to watch a film, we did a series of uncharacteristic stuff that led her parents to believe that we were having sex... now when we meet up we keep her bedroom door open.",4
"by trying to make myself last longer during sex..  this happened earlier this week and i'm still processing it. also, throwaway because i don't want my grandkids to find this one day. 

my longtime girlfriend had just completed her time of the month, and we were ready to engage in some heated sexual activity. we're both going through rather busy times in our life right now, so sex doesn't come as often as it should, but enough to fulfill our needs. now, the past few weeks i've been helping (doing) my gf do homework for one of her online classes. because of this, she realized she owed me and decided to pay me by way of sexual favors. unethical? maybe, but i'm not complaining. so, she begins to initiate foreplay and start to enjoy one of the better blow jobs of my life. she does her thing for a while and i stop her a few times before i hit her with that high fructose porn syrup. after edging a few times, i decide to return the favor and go down on here. i do my thing, she does hers, and now back to me. well, by this time we're about an hour in and she starts to get tired. i finally comply with her and prepare to unleash my homemade protein shake. however, because i have delayed the inevitable for so long, she is taking breaks every few licks of the tootsie pop. the next four events happen all simultaneously. i let my lover know its time, she comes up for a breather, my johnson flops down on my stomach (i'm on my back), and i treat myself to a very salty penis colada. it. was. everywhere. a catastrophic and life-changing event. i, and nor should you, ever take those cum shot compilations for granted. those girls are troopers. 

tl;dr – i was edging during oral with my girlfriend. she got tired and took a break. i climaxed all over my face. 

edit: man y'all are wild. thanks for the platinum, gold, and silver. happy holidays, may snow fall on all of your faces.",4
"by leaving a suicide note before running outside. okay so the obligatory this happened a few months back.

a little backstory, i have dealt with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, have a few (obviously) unsuccessful attempts. good news; i'm better now and i laugh about it. i was better back then too.

also worth mentioning i'm into writing short stories and currently a novel.

so back to the fuck-up, a short story i was writing back then started off with a 15 year old girl finding a suicide letter dated 10 years into the future, and is in her own handwriting. i bet you can see where this is going.. so i start drafting the letter and before i finish it with the dating and stuff i get a call from my friend saying she is around and wants to talk, so i get out saying very little to my mom.

after leaving in a hurry and staying outside for a few hours my mom gets worried and calls me. *shocker* i left my phone at home. (it's really not a rare thing for me to do, it's rare i take it with me unless i'm going to school or a date or something) she goes into my room and sees ""my"" suicide note.

she gets scared and calls my dad. soon after, my family is driving around looking for me. i walk back home and to my surprise there is police cars and my parents are crying. after a quick explaining and a few hours of scolding everything was fine but i felt terrible for putting my parents through that fear again.


tl;dr: me, a previously suicidal teen, writes a suicide letter for a short story, then leaves the house in a hurry, parents call the cops thinking i killed myself, i show up eating ice cream and get scolded. generally felt terrible


edit: wow a lot of you want to read the horrible piece of fiction i wrote back then, i can't find the original story but i'll try to rewrite from memory in the morning!

"picking up the wrong person from the airport and getting pulled over at gun point by the police.. i live near a smaller airport and i help out at the local turkish community center.  i'm white but i go to a free dinner they do every other thursday and it is amazing, so i chose to volunteer every once in a while.   set up, take down, help older people out, the usual volunteer at a center thing. i've met a ton of awesome people and they are a blast to hang out with.

so last week, i was tasked to pick up an older woman flying in from turkey as she was the guest of honor at a fundraiser they were having. i was told she knew little to no english and i wasn't the first choice to go get her, i was just the only one available seeing everyone else had bigger jobs to do. 

they give me a sign with her surname on it, her flight number, and a general description of what she looked like. whiteboard in hand and a little hesitant, i set off for the airport ready to get my cargo.

i pull up to the international gate and immediately an eastern european woman standing all alone. i get out with my sign that says 'demir' and she smiles with great joy, points at the sign, points at herself and without hesitation, loads her bags in the car and hops in. last name? check. eastern european? check. not much english? check. can't believe my luck!!

i pull out of the airport and immediately head in the direction of the turkish center with my passenger all buckled up ready for the 35 minute drive.  about 15 minutes into the ride, she pulls out her phone and begins to rustle around. she calls someone and frantically speaks in turkish. i'm thinking she left something on the plane or at home. i felt bad but i couldn't do anything about it at the time, i was driving in the freeway.

10 minutes later, i'm off the freeway and a cop passes. he immediately flips a bitch, lights me up and i pull over. at this point i'm freaking out and when i turn around, i see the lady has uber out and upon further inspection, i'm not the uber driver.....

the cop tells me to get out and i am taken down very fast, by a plethora of cops, handcuffed, and put in the back of a squad car with zero information. my head hurts from the slam against the ground and i'm fully aware of the kidnapping situation i'm in. 

after about 15 minutes of the lady screaming in turkish to the police and other cars arriving, an officer opens the door and asks me my story.  i ask him to use my phone to contact the turkish center and the lead woman comes down to explain what happened. 

little did i know 'demir' is one of the most common surnames in all of turkey. so when the lady(her first trip to america) see that i have her name, she figures i'm the uber driver ready to pick her up. she knows how to use google maps and saw we were headed in the opposite direction of her intended destination. my heart is still going 10,000 beats a minute while another car with a friend from the center and what could be the real 'demir' pulls up. 

after a discussion that i'm not a part of takes place, the cops get me out of the car, unhand-cuff me and everyone, including the kidnapped woman, seems to be laughing....except me. i am in disbelief as of to what just happened and i definitely sweated through my entire outfit. we get back to the turkish center and the story spread like wild fire. everyone comes up to me with a hug, a laugh, and a drink. i got drunk drunk. 

tl;dr by picking up the wrong woman and getting arrested for kid napping. first names count, people!!!

edit: detained, not arrested. also, talking with turks, they all have varying degrees of where the country resides. eastern is too white, middle is bad in america, so most of them just say they are from turkey.",4
"by ripping my anus open. 
the following events transpired yesterday. spent last night in a&e, on hardly any sleep and some pretty strong painkillers, so apologies for any mistakes here.

me and my girlfriend are trying to lose weight, and so for the past few months we have been eating super clean. salads, quinoa, lean meats, etc. (very few carbs). lost some weight, gained some muscle from working out too. very happy with our progress.

because we had been so disciplined and it was my birthday, we decided to treat ourselves to our previously weekly treat of takeout. a huge pizza, fries, and nachos each (i know, hence why we needed to lose weight), washed down with soda. 

we went to bed feeling very full and happy, if a little guilty.

i awoke a few hours later with intense stomach cramps. i could feel a ball of pizza nacho fries forming in the pit of my stomach and could tell it was not going to be pretty coming out. i waited till morning to go to the bathroom (small apartment, light sleeper gf), and as soon as i sat down on the crapper and pushed, i felt the most intense pain in my anal sphincter. like it was being pulled apart from every angle. my girlfriend, who i had woken up by screaming, was now banging on the bathroom door thinking i was being murdered.

the worst part was that i couldn't exactly pinch this bad boy off, as the seal had been broken and my 'pincher' was now severely compromised. so i pushed through the pain, and could feel the ripping worsen with each push as this dry, fibrous monster made it's way out of my asshole. after about 25 minutes i had birthed the hellsnake. i only wish i had taken a photo as this thing was a sight to behold.

a painful car journey and 3 hour wait later, the doctor said i had the worst anal fissures he had ever seen. apparently the turd was so fat and hard it'd literally ripped my asshole open in multiple places.

sitting is agony, they itch and burn like hell and i can feel a second boulder pushing its way into my lower intestine. 

for all you sickos:

edit: i'm sorry reddit, i didn't take a photo. i wish i did. i wish i could go back in time and fix this...wait, no i don't. i don't want this to turn into a reddit fable where my compromised pincher is being spread between the dark corners of the web for the rest of time, so no i will not be squatting over a mirror and taking a picture of my anus. sorry. i also love my girlfriend too much to ask her to get in there with a camera; there's no use in two people being traumatized by this.

for all those sending get well messages and asking for updates: thank you sincerely. my girlfriend got over her anxiety and collected a cornucopia of stool softeners, numbing sprays, ice packs, and everything else imaginable. thank you all for the advice. she and the chemist shared a laugh when she showed her the story. how nice...",4
"by running with the school flag, tripping, and destroying the state championship trophy in front of the whole school.. so the mess up happened yesterday and i'm still saying ""oh my god"" to myself every time i think about it.

this past saturday our school's girls cross country team won state and because of that earned everyone a pep rally. the night before someone asked if anyone wanted to be the flag runner and i happily volunteered(https://i.imgur.com/qfllrsl.jpg), because that's a super dope job. i mean what could possibly go wrong?

well here is exactly what went wrong:
 
the pep rally is in motion. the cross country team starts pouring down from the stands to lead a school cheer. this is exactly when you should do a flag run, so i start haulin' out and narrowly avoid plowing one girl and make my way around the crowd (definitely wouldn't recommend to a friend now though). i am caught up in the buzz of the moment and then all of a sudden i'm going down hard...(https://i.imgur.com/xpl4p0i.mp4)
all that is going through my head is siren noises and me thinking ""i should just die now"" but unfortunately that never came to fruition and it got worse as i saw what i had tripped on and destroyed: the state trophy we just won and the one from last year!(https://i.imgur.com/gyagail.png)
now i'm a bit more famous around the school and kids keep seeing me in the hallway an saying ""omg! you're the kid who broke the trophy!!""
rip me

tl;dr i was the flag runner and i tripped over and destroyed two state trophies in front of the whole school.

edit: thanks for the gold! that makes it all worth it (sort of)! just a bit of extra info, the trophies have been repaired with tender, sweet words and some wood glue.

edit 2: wow 5 gold i'm willing to destroy another trophy, if it nets me 5 more!",4
"by wearing jeans with a hole in them. this just happened minutes ago. i'm in a children's hospital with my wife and son because he's been having severe asthma issues.

my wife is laying in the bed with my son on top of her, and i've just been sitting in one of the chairs. as people kept coming in, i noticed some rather odd looks from them, some mumbling, and some more odd looks. i figured i had some food on my face or something and didn't think too much of it.

suddenly, i'm sitting there reading something on reddit when my wife looks at me and says, ""what's that between your legs?""

i look down, and there's a pink ball between my legs. confusion quickly turns to shock as i realize that pink ball is one of *my* balls. one of my testicles is literally hanging out of my pants and is sitting on the seat.

i don't have a spare pair of pants here, so now i'm just sitting with my legs tightly together like i'm wearing a skirt and praying my son doesn't stay here long.

tl;dr i found out i had a hole in my pants by multiple people noticing a testicle sitting on my chair.

**edit: most common question is about my undergarments. i was indeed wearing boxers. my testicle came out the bottom of them.**

edit2: wow this post really got the ball rolling (what, i can't do testy puns too?). thank you kind stranger for the coconut reward! i had no idea such an appropriate award existed for this situation.

**edit3: i got pants! as several people suggested, i explained my predicament to the nurse, and she hooked me up with a pair of scrub pants. they'll make excellent pajama pants.**

and thank you for another coconut! i have two now! how fitting. thank you, kind stranger.

edit4: another coconut (three nuts now—one can fall out, and i still have two left) and a silver. thank you again!

edit5: popped my gold cherry. guess everything is popping for me today. thank you, internet stranger!

**edit6: dammit! replacement pants are actually worse than original pants. here's me wearing them on top of my pants(https://imgur.com/a/xi6y80b). the ""fly"" makes no sense. wife confirms it.**

edit7: thank you to /u/jedberg for evening out my balls at two pairs and another kind stranger for more silver!

**last ever edit: son is doing better. we can hopefully leave tomorrow. my ball has been staying put in two sets of pants. thank you for all the love and support everyone. sorry for going a little (lot) edit crazy. just overwhelmed by all the support.**",4
"by showing my cat a plushie that looks like her. at the office today, there was a raffle for some stuffed animal toys and i won one. i chose one that looked almost exactly like my cat thinking i'd get a cute photo of them together.

i get home and put the toy on the bed next to her and snap a photo. she doesn't care, but hey, mission accomplished. 

fast forward 6 hrs and i'm playing rollercoaster tycoon 2. i suddenly hear my cat howling up a storm and look over to the bed and she is crying at the stuffed version of herself. she's picking it up by the neck, dragging it around, setting it down, staring into its lifeless eyes, and just crying nonstop. 

i take it away from her but she doesn't stop howling. her fur is all puffed up and her eyes look so scared. i think she thought it was a dead cat. i open the door to my room and she bolts out and starts cowering in the furthest corner of the apartment from my room. she won't let me near her.

i feel like a villain. i love her more than anything and now she's fearing for her life.

tldr; i brought a stuffed cat toy home for my cat. she thought i brought her a dead cat and freaked out.

edit: by request, i'm paying the cat tax. this is mushroom and she's 9 years old. i adopted her two weeks ago after fostering her for a couple months.

"by introducing my pitbull to my kitten. so, a little bit of backstory: 

my mom used to work in a barn caring for horses. one day somebody came with a dog. it was emaciated looking, and had scars on its face. my mom felt bad for it and brought it home. we found that it was abused as a puppy and abandoned. it's now five years later and she's healthy and resilient. she's scared of anybody raising objects around her or making loud noises due to her past, but she's protective of her family and a lovely dog for the house. she's been a bit overprotective recently, growling at passersby on walks, and it's something we're working on. being that she's a muscular, intimidating looking dog, people tend to stay away anyway. other than that, she's a perfect pitbull.

we also just adopted a kitten (8 weeks old) and it's the tiniest, most adorable animal i've ever owned. after around a week we decided to introduce the dog to the kitten, with strict supervision. we brought them both into the kitchen and put them on the ground. surprisingly, they sniffed each other and walked away with little interest. oh, whatever. 

so me and my gf have to run to walmart so we leave the two of them together, knowing they weren't really interested in one another. we leave for around half an hour, and are shocked when we walk in.

our pitbull is in the corner of the living room, shaking, with her eyes open wide as the kitten pounces and chases after her tail. she's yipping at the baby kitten that weighs less than a pound. we separate them into different rooms while in tears laughing and make a note not to let them in the same room together for a while.

tldr: left pitbull with tiny kitten, pitbull ends up cowering in the corner while kitten plays with her tail.


edit: all those saying this was irresponsible, i'm going to add that they had met a few times previously and we made sure that the pitbull didn't display aggressive behaviours toward the kitten. i am qualified with animal behaviour, and all safety was ensured. my mother was also at my house at the time.

edit 2: unfortunately i've been flooded with anti-pitbull lunatics. i may take a while to respond to my inbox.",4
"by being to shy to tell the lunch guy i'm not muslim. the lunch guy at my job thinks i'm muslim.
it started off with a subtle ""do you want the turkey sausage instead"". at this point i'm thinking ""well maybe something is wrong with the pork sausage"".  admittedly, part of me suspected the mistake then because i'm pretty brown looking, i have a beard, and arab and desi people have mistaken me for one of their own plenty of times. let's be real, he damn sure didn't think i was jewish (*funny story: i'm jewish enough to legally immigrate to israel under their current law of return but this is just a detail.*). 
but i didn't speak up. 
well today i went to grab a pancake plate with bacon and he looked alarmed and of course i pipe up and said ""oh it's fine i'll just eat around it"" which is somewhat true: i don't actually like bacon and i really did just want the pancakes. i must admit however that this was to avoid confronting him on the matter (there was a whole line of people behind me). well, as thoughtful and nice as he is, he insisted that he could make me a new one and that he would feel bad if i took the plate just to make it easier for him because then i'd be being a *bad muslim* just to convenience him. well then. 
this was the first time that he outright called me muslim.
did i come clean, confess the truth  and embarrass him? no, in fact i'm at my desk wondering what i'm going to do for ramadan.


edit:     

1. thanks for the gold.           

2. the cafeteria guy is a really nice guy, loud, jokes around with everyone in such a way that every morning is almost like a group conversation between me, him, and the rest of the line. it's a great way to start a morning- the guy is very personable. the flipside is that the times where i might privately correct the matter are few and far between.           

3. *that seinfeld interpretation was absolutely legendary.*          

4. i really wish i would have spelt *too* correctly.

"my first date.. i'm a very socially awkward person.

so when the numerous hours of back-and-forth chit chat with women on tinder resulted in a first date i was ecstatic. we had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; tv shows, movies, and what not. after my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, i decided ""fuck it"" and asked if she wanted to see rogue one with me last friday night. she said yes!

the night comes and i decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that i wear on a daily basis. jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket i'd received from my mother on christmas. it was raining too so i grabbed an umbrella on my way out.

i get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. i wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. nervous, i walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. we shake hands, say hi to one another, and i ask if she's ready to head down to the movie theater. she says yes and off we go.

here's where it went south.

we're walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. i'm not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what i did, but i immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. confused, she asks what i'm doing to which i reply, ""i got this.""  she quickly realizes what i'm about to do and starts saying ""oh, you don't have t-"". 

i cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. the silence quickly makes me realize what i've done. i mutter out a ""after you..."" and she continues to stare at me.

without a word, she ghosts me on the spot. i pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.

maybe next time.",4
"by nearly twisting my dick off with a fleshlight duct taped to an industrial fan.. alright so this was a few weeks ago. i was going to post about it then but decided to see how things healed since i knew there would probably be questions. this is long but there was a lot too it sorry.

this began as many other bad ideas do, i had smoked some herb and was horny. my roommate was out of town for the day and i had the place to myself, figured i would take advantage of the rare opportunity and try to enjoy something more than just a speed fap. i pulled out the fleshlight that  i rarely use and started to get to work. i was at my computer but could not really get into it. trying to operate the mouse and the fleshlight while lubed up was too cumbersome and it just felt like jacking off with more steps involved(the main reason i don't really use it). i pulled up some porn on my phone and tried to find a way to stuff the fleshlight between my mattress, and then in a shoe for a hands free experience but still was having trouble so gave up.  

leaning over the bed my box fan was blowing on my bare ass so i went over too shut it off and that's when i got the idea. i took the front grill off and duct tape the back of the fleshlight too the center of the fan. overwhelmed with anticipation of my new discovery i lubed up my boner, inserted it and turn on the fan. it felt extremely good but was not quite working, the fan was too weak and the friction was slowing it down nearly to a stop, i knew i was onto something and needed a bigger fan. being walking distance from a walmart i headed over.  

they had a couple to choose from i almost went with the biggest $140 drum fan since bigger seemed better(really glad i didn't) but instead opted for the $60 industrial floor fan that seemed like it would be more than good enough for the job at hand. i also happened to pick up one of those stupid hands free phone supports that go around your neck so i could have the ultimate experience. at this point i couldn't wait and basically power walked home with this giant box. i opened it up, took off the front grill and rigged it up the same way. phone around my neck, looking like an idiot, i lubed up and inserted my dong.

what came next was pure heaven, this was legit one of the best things i have ever felt. the fleshlight was slightly off center so it almost made it vibrate while spinning. the vibration mixed with the spinning, the nubs in the fleshlight and manual thrusting in and out was insane. i tried the second speed but that was too much to handle. just as i was really getting into it my phone began to ring, my sister was calling which she doesn't normally do unless it's important. i stopped the fan while still inserted and talked with her on the phone for around 5 minutes. after we finished the call i turned my video and then the fan back on.

this was my big mistake, at this point my meat was nearly flaccid but still stretched out a bit in the fleshlight. in order to secure it to the fan the bottom of the flesh light had to be completely tightened. the bottom usually has a release valve so you can control how much suction there is on the inside, completely tightened is maximum suction. before i could even comprehend what was happening i felt some tightening and then a searing pain in my penis. my brain took me a second to process before i pulled my dick out and i literally saw it unwind in front of me. i'm uncertain how many times, was at least a couple and the sight of this along with the pain in my wiener caused me to black out. when i came too i shut off the fan which was still spinning and my shlong was feeling red hot. panicking i just pranced around the gripping it. other than being really red and shriveled in it looked fairly normal no rips that i could see. being high and extremely embarrassed i grabbed some frozen vegetables, placed them on my rod and decided to wait it out a bit.  

the waiting was horrible but couple hours in everything seemed to be getting a bit better until i had too pee which just felt like lava dribbling from my shaft. at this point i was feeling more sober and drove myself too the urgent care where i was seen by a doctor and then directed to a urologist. i came clean since i wanted a proper diagnosis and you can imagine the reaction. almost seemed like he was more disappointed in me with every question i answered. i was given a cavernosography where they inject die into your cock before an x-ray to see if the vessels are damaged and an mri. he said that  i may suffer some permanent damage from the penile torsion i was very scared waiting for the results.

that is the point i was originally going to write this but this is the update after 3 weeks. everything came back good, the inflammation was likely causing the pain inside while urinating, the pain on the outside was from a friction burn, basically after me dick twisted as much as it could the fleshlight was still moving around it for a few rotations and gave me a burn across my whole dick. that has since cleared up and everything is back around 80%. now that i'm getting boners again i'm honestly half temped to try again since it felt so good. just remember if you try this to stay extremely hard and well lubricated the whole time.

tl;dr was high and horny got the idea to duct tape a fleshlight to an industrial fan. things went wrong when i turned it on with a flaccid penis. my dick twisted multiple times before i passed out. after seeing a urologist no permanent damage was incurred besides some inflammation and a friction burn on my entire shaft. everything is feeling good again and may give it another go in the future.",4
"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw update. so some of you may remember my original post where i accidentally saw pictures of my girlfriend sucking the biggest dick i've ever seen:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bo6nut/tifu_by_swiping_on_my_girlfriends_phone_nsfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

i've had had thousands of messages asking for an update, and a similar amount of messages asking for the pictures (i don't have them and i don't want to see them again).

the truth is there isn't much of an update because i never confronted her about it. i decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.

our sex life is back to normal and i feel like i've mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. we all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.  

i thought i would also use this as an opportunity to address some of the most common questions/comments.

—

why does she still have the pictures?

honestly i think she probably forgot. we all have stuff on our phones going back years. i found some nudes of exes that i had forgotten about so i guess i'm as bad as her.

how did you know it was her ex?

because i could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in

was it photoshopped or a strap-on?

no

you must be exaggerating no dick is that big

2 coke cans is about right. it was bigger than her forearm.

as you can imagine, i've also received a bunch of dick pics in my dms with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. thanks for that chaps.  

a dick that big couldn't get hard

it certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. so maybe you're right.

her pussy must be stretched/cavernous/gaping

she probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls i've been with. i guess you don't know how vaginas work.

someone told me that my original post was the most upvoted nsfw post in the history of reddit. i don't know if that's true, but i guess that's pretty cool.

"by teaching my children not to fight, but to work together. almost two years ago now.

two kids, boys, 5 and 4. fight like cats and dogs. anything to annoy the other and start a fight. grab a random object and throw it at the other when dad isn't looking kind of thing.

one day i'm cleaning up the kitchen and the ruckus is extreme. i interject and sit them both down for a long talk about how much better things can be if they cooperate instead. at the end of it, i went back into the kitchen and resumed cleaning. a remarkable length of *quiet* while later, the 4yo comes to me.

4yo: dad, dad, come see what i made! \*grabbing my hand\*

me: sure, lets see.

he leads me to their room to the corner table where they have art supplies. and points to the papers on the table. he likes to draw and i encourage it when i can. what i see on the table however, are just random scribbles...

me: is this what you wanted to show me? \*i pick up the paper and check both sides, just a few random scribbles\*

me: that's... great buddy, but why don't you come get me when it's finished? \*i put the paper down and turn to walk\*

4yo: no, no! dad, *look!* \*pointing at the papers\*

okay, maybe i missed one? i look through them again, no, just scribbles? i'm still looking at them when suddenly..

4yo grabs the papers from my hand and tosses them back on the table.

4yo: ok dad, i'll show you later, you can go. \*pushing me towards the door\*

i'm a little confused, he's not like this usually. i pause outside their room, and when i do, i hear the crinkle of cellophane. 

my boys room is off the hallway leading to the stairs down the the basement. the stairs to the basement, are crinkling. 

i poke my head around the corner of the staircase and there is 5yo. with a package of oreos clutched to his chest. he looks at me with big eyes and i just hold out one hand and point with the other. i took the package and he walked by right as i couldn't hold my dad face any longer. 

see, the oreos were on top of the refrigerator. so what has happened is 4yo baited me, while 5yo got a chair from the dining room, carried it to the kitchen to retrieve the loot then put the chair back and hid. this has to have been meticulously plotted. i'm a mix of horrified and proud.

i had to quickly put dad face back on to tell them to not sneak treats and to now clean their room. then i left the room and had a brief ""what have i done?"" moment back in the living room.

tl;dr my kids went from the animaniacs to pinky and the brain.",4
"by meeting a girl on tinder to, ""netflix and chill"". yes, this actually happened today, see imgur link. also, sorry for this being long, see tl;dr below.

i matched with a girl on tinder today. the profile was ambiguous, just a picture of her laying down on her belly, no bio. i usually start with a creative message derived from the pictures or bio. i decided to just message her, ""i don't have much to go off from your profile. what does come to mind is that you have a nice looking butt"" she responds, ""wanna touch my butt in perosn""(https://imgur.com/a/x6cas3v) you can read the rest of the conversation from that imgur link. bottom line is, we decided to meet at my apartment and that i would give her $40 for some weed.

this felt like a whole new level of trashy for me. so far in life, i have only had sex with four people, and i make a serious attempt to date them. i asked my friends what i should do, they said it did not seem too sketch. i was going to say no, until i thought to myself, *""hey dude, when you are an old man, you will regret not having casual sex with a stranger more than not knowing what could have been.""*

i end up giving her my number and she calls me. there were a few things over the phone that gave me a bad feeling. first, she sounded *way* too casual over the phone. it felt like i was scheduling an appointment with a receptionist. second, she thought that we were doing this at her place. i asked her if she had roommates, and she responded yes. i told her that it made more sense to do this at my place since i live alone. she ends up hanging up. i am thinking, *""alright, whatever this all seemed too good to be true anyways.""* she calls back 3 minutes later saying that she lost cell phone reception for a minute. this was the final item to make me feel uneasy. in hindsight she was obviously lying. the amount of time between calls was far too long for her to have just lost connection.

she agreed to do this at my place. i insisted that we get coffee first so i can make sure i am not bringing a wacko into my apartment. she agreed to that and i am feeling more comfortable now. she just asks for a ride, which was not a problem for me.

i leave to pick her up and get $40 for the bud. up to this point, i was feeling really nervous about going through with this. then, while i am actually going through with it, all those thoughts disappeared. i am just thinking to myself, *""tonight is going to be fun! i am about to get a little high with a cute girl, play some mario kart with her, 'watch netflix', get my dick wet, and maybe even... cuddle?""*

little did i know, i am about to get majorly bamboozled. the address she gave me was not listed. i call her, she says just to meet her at the rite aid on the corner. this is when i should have known to back out. however, at this point, i am dead set on eating pussy. i meet her at the rite aid parking lot. she actually looks like her profile and all the nerves are gone again. she said we could expect her dealer to show up any minute. she gets the call 2 minutes later. i am thinking to myself, *""what kind of drug dealer is this prompt?""* but me being a gullible idiot, i give her my $40 anyways.

then she meets some dude on the corner and they walk off together, not to be seen again. i immediately realize that i have been played. she texts me, ""ur beat sorry"" and that was that.

was i mad? no, not at all. the situation could have been far worse. it could have been more money. she could have been an undercover cop. she could have been lying about her age. i could have been beat up by her boyfriend. i could have gotten an std. the list goes on folks.

right now, i feel three things. i feel great shame, this is not the guy i am. i am just lonely and would have appreciated some sexual comfort. i also feel really bad for her. she must be in a tight spot to have gone through with that. i am sure that she needs my $40 more than i do. finally, i feel really unlucky, as yesterday was my cake day. if this could have happened just one day earlier, my post would have been gilded *for sure*.

ladies and gentlemen, what did we learn today? if a situation seems too good to be true, it is.

tl;dr i met a girl on tinder who just wanted to get high and fuck. i give her the money for the weed and she just walks off with it.

"by lending a hot girl my fav hoodie. this sad tale literally just came to its bitter end.

so until 20 minutes ago i owned a gorgeous, bright yellow death grips hoodie that was my pride and joy. my mum bought it me for christmas last year and it was my absolute favourite item of clothing.

last night i went out with my mates and happened to meet an attractive spanish girl who was just in manchester for the weekend. we chatted for a bit and made out in the club smoking area as one does, then after a while she complained about the cold english weather. i predictably offered her my precious hoodie at this point. fast forward a few hours and we exchange contact details as we planned to meet the next day to hang out, then she leaves the club. i realise she's still wearing the hoodie so run after her and ask for it back. 

this is where i make my fatal error, a fine example of thinking with your genitals instead of your head. i had the smart idea that if i let her keep the hoodie for the night, itll mean she has to meet me the next day and can't back out thus allowing me more time to charm her. i essentially used the jumper as fishing bait but didn't think that the fish could just eat said bait and swim away. *spoiler alert* this is what happened. 

the next day i awoke excited to spend some time with this girl and waited patiently for her to reply to my messages so we could arrange to meet. by 5 in the evening i start to get worried and message her again as well as asking her friend to reply to me. my messages get left 'seen' for about an hour before they both block me on all social media platforms shooting in the head any chance of me seeing my beautiful jumper ever again. 

to the spanish girl who stomped on a nice gesture and on my heart, know that you have made me sad. 

rest in peace sweet banana coloured hoodie x

tl;dr lent a hot girl my best jumper in an attempt to guarantee more courtship time, girl steals hoodie

edit: thanks for all the support guys this is pretty insane, also thanks for the gold and silver! to everyone offering to buy me a new one, thanks for being so kind and thoughtful but i'll have to politely decline. it would be too weird for me haha but if theres anyone in the uk that has one lying around that theyd maybe sell give me a message! x",4
"i met the person who has phone number i've been giving out as my number. obligatory ""didn't happen today"".

when i go shopping or order things online i always give a phone number that is one digit different than mine because i don't want them to sell my info. by using the be same number every time i am consistent if i'm ""already in the system"".  i've been using this number for about 10 years everywhere from jcpenney to best buy to financial services, etc.

yesterday i got a new client and he had the same number i've been using as my ""fake number"".  i tried my best not to show any emotion to hearing it but i asked him how long he's had that number.  he said ""oh, about 15 years, but i may get a new one because i get non-stop telemarketing calls.""  i told him, ""i get some once in awhile too. aren't they annoying *haha*""

he says, ""yeah, i think maybe someone is giving out my number because they keep asking if {my first name} is available.""

i said, ""that happens to me from time to time as well, people think i'm {old homeowner's name} or {bosses name}. oh well. email me if you change your number.""

he says ""i will. actually they ask for **you** pretty much all the time. what's your number? i bet they are getting us confused.  it seems strange almost all of them ask for you even thought we're not related"".

i gave him my work number.

**tl;dr: i've been giving out a fake number and met the guy who actually has that number in real life and he gets telemarketing calls non-stop because of it.**

edit: so tonight i had a meeting at the guy's office to go over a proposal. i spent too much time reading comments this afternoon (and felt bad) and i told him my personal number was one digit off from his.  so he says, ""yeah i figured everyone had misdialed for the last few years or this might have been your old number."" he knew right away when he saw my name...

so, i never told him i had given every company on earth his number (not knowing it was him) but i did tell him i gave the wrong number at guitar center a few times. dont ask me why i came clean for one place but not the rest of them. he laughed it off.

so, i've learned not to give any more fake numbers and i did bring the guy a gift card to longhorn steakhouse as 'thanks and take your wife out to dinner"" when in reality i felt bad because i didn't think through my actions and many of you called me out.",4
"by making a cash register boy blush. short but sweet, obligatory tl;dr at the bottom.

i (f 34) was on my way back home from work, passing by the local grocery store and supermarket, located very close to my home.there are normally lots of stray cats in the neighborhood, but there is one in particular that always comes running when she sees me, so even when i am loaded with shopping bags, i can't help myself petting her.today was no exception. i made sure to pet her only with the left hand, because i knew i wouldn't be able to wash my hands immediately (love her but she is kinda dingy), so to avoid touching my face or hair (as i often do), i was trying to do everything with my right hand.

so i go to the supermarket next, already on the cash register, unloading my basket and chit-chatting with the boy who works it (he looks to be in his early 20's, kinda cute), like i normally do.while i'm helping him arrange all items in my bag, i followed his gaze and noticed the questioning look he gave my left hand, as it must have appeared quite weird that i wouldn't use it, and instead hold it aside, like a surgeon ready to operate.me being the kind of person who feels the need to explain any misunderstandings away (because god forbid somebody thinks something weird about me, lol) chirp up casually:-oh, i just stroke a kitty with that hand, so i try not to touch anything else before i wash my hands properly.mind you, i said that in my native language, where the word for kitty and the euphemism are interchangeable, like *p.u.s.s.y* in english.

he stopped scanning the groceries for a moment and when i looked at him, he had this priceless expression on his face.... eyes a little wide, sort of flushed, looking at me in disbelief.only then did it hit me what i said and how it must have sounded to him.i quickly corrected myself, elaborating saying:-kitty. cat, you know. a stray. meow meow. (yes, i really said that....\*cringe\*)

he made an ""oooooh..."" sound and bit his lips suppressing a burst of laughter.

i think i might shop elsewhere in the next few days... \*facepalm\*

tl;dr: i accidentally woke somebody's dirty mind by making him think i've pet my kitty...

**edit**: thank you so much for the platinum and silver, i just wanted to vent by sharing a mildly cringe-worthy story from my day with a healthy dose of self-irony. 

i didn't expect it to blow out like it did.   
i appreciate all the kind and funny comments, but i'm also shocked to see how far could some people twist my words into extremely dark connotations - i even saw comments about me being creepy, predatory etc, which is absurd.  
i know i shouldn't ""feed the trolls"" by engaging and reasoning, what reasoning when somebody posts an absurd comment meant solely to upset or offend, indeed.  
but seriously, those who suggested i was in any way deliberately inappropriate or had some hidden lewd agenda towards this guy - i suggest you read my post again carefully and then if you still think so, seek some professional help, because the issue is with you, not with me.",4
"by honey dicking my wife after she found my used condoms...nsfw. well brethren, i too wanted to partake in the great coconutting frenzy. today was my day off and was also my wifes longest day of work. it should be mentioned shes on her period, and sex is out of the picture for her. i havent busted a nut in roughly 4 days, and the idea of penetrating a milky coconut somehow thrilled me after reading the whole coconut-fucking-bonanza today.

i went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. after getting home, i uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. once the hole was set into place, i expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. once i got a good fit after doing a ""test run"" i found the hairs to be a little too much. i shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. the preparations were made, the mood was set, and i opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.

fast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. all is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. i knew i fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers i had used. aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. i told her i cheated on her with a coconut. .. it took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove i didn't have anyone else over and i simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. she was furious and i tried to console her by saying i'd never cheat on her with anyone..just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. i'm not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/

tl;dr : fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought i was cheating on her, had to fess up.

"being on my period and getting drunk. so like the title said i fucked up (it was after midnight so technicly today) by having my period and getting drunk.
if your one of those guys who nearly faints when someone mentions the word period, this post aint for you, it will fuck up your life.

my son's birthday was yesterday, so i've been running around all day catering everybody and making sure the kids don't break anything/eachother. somewhere around noon i noticed my period got heavy and i put in a tampon, and went back to my guests.

around 7 o'clock everyone left except my husband's best friend, i put the kids to bed and started to relax. i've had a wine or 2 during the day, and now with my kids in bed i treated myself to a glass of wine, and during the evening my husband and i got pretty wasted (which for my was kinda easy cos i hadnt had a drink in like 2 weeks). 
around 11 my husband went to bed because he got tired and pretty bored with me and his friend because we where talking about games, watching trailers, that kind of stuff. and since i've got no gamer friends i had a good time, getting drunker by the minute. around 00.30 husbands friend decides to go home. 

this is where my fu begins.

i was pretty drunk, and drunk me tought sexytime with husband was a good idea (cos let's face it, drunk sexytime is the best sexytime). but then i realised i still had my tampon in, so i had to get it out (also because it's dangerous to have it in for as long as i unknowingly had, but most because of my desired sexytime). 

i went to the toilet, ready to pull it out, when i realised i couldnt ""find"" it, or the string. after some fumbling around i could feel al little bit of the string, alllllll the way tucked in. i spend about 15 minutes grabbing the string, trying to pull it out, only to feel like it was stuck, and i couldnt get a good grip at it. 
i was getting annoyed at this point, fingering myself on the toilet in search of the lost tampon wasn't the kind of sexytime i had in mind. 

i decided to call the hap (i live in holland, here we dont go to the er for everything, we go to out ""homedoctor"" for small things like a cold, bump on the head, vaccinations, deep cut and so on. but outside working hours there is the hap which is like the on duty doctor/ nurse for like 50 doctors in the area). 

trying to sound kinda sober i explained the nurse my problem, she was kind but firm, if i didnt get the fucker out in an hour, i had to come by and they would extract it. if i would wait till morning i would have it in for 20 hours and that is dangerous.  that would mean i would have to wake-up my husband not for sexytime but for i fucked up time, and we would have to get the kids out of bed.
i wasnt gonna let that happen (primerely because im the hilarious one in our relationship, and i wasn't ready to hear ""yo pussy so big, tampons get lost"" jokes for the rest of my life). 

so before this moment i was a woman on a mission, now i was frodo trying to get this tampon out of sauromons grip. 

nurse mentioned trying to squad or take a relaxing shower. 

so here i was squatting in the shower with my hand in the depths of erebor. still not getting good enough grip. so i take the showerhead put the waterstream on 10 and try to flush this white torpedo out. guess what, didnt work... this goes on like 15 minutes, time is getting scarce. 

decide to lean agains the wall squatting, and i finally have the string between the tips of my thumb and indexfinger. i am not letting go now! while i pull gentely i push like i'm in labour, and what do you think, i finally pulled the fucker out! 

i felt extatic, leaned against the wall again in relieve, feeling proud about my victory.. sexytime here i come! 

before i leave to shower i decide to take a closer look at the fucker, wondering why it took longer for me to give birth to this annoying bugger than with my youngest son.

i look at it, lying in the corner.. and my mind goes blank for a minute... then i scream.. i would't have flipped out more if it was the wormy thing from alien..
...then the realisation kicked in.. 

i.pulled.out.my.fucking.iud...  insert drunken hyperventilation.. omg i pulled out my iud.. it was just lying there in the corner like some aborted metal fishook al bloody and gross..

if you think my fu ends here.. think again.. keep in mind it's around 2/3 o'clock now.

in my panic i decide to call my mom (waking-up husband isn't nessesary annymore couse sexytime is off the table!). my father answers the phone all sleepy, and i ask for my mom. ""well sweatie, we were sleeping, whatever it is, i can help you, no need to wake your mother."" okay... 

iwantedtohavesexytimewithhusbandbutimhavingmyperioditouhgticouldntgetmytamponoutbutnowipulledoutmyiud... helppppp!!!!  ""......""  daddy?  ""......"" ""m. wake up your daughter needs you!"" 

so now i explained to my mother what happend and she managed to calm me down, and said i needed to call the hap again. 
so i did, got the same nurse, explained what happend. she consulted with her collegue, and asked me some additional questions to find out if im oke.. 

""ma'am, are you shivvering?"" yes i am. ""can you decribe how bad?"" well i was in the shower, and now i'm standing in my bathroom all naked and wet for like 15 minutes now, so i'm getting kinda cold. 
""okay, thats a good explanation, are you dizzy ma'am?"" yes i am dizzy. ""can you decribe how dizzy?"" well i drank like a bottle of wine, thats how dizzy i am.(muffled laughter on the other end of the phone) ""well i guess thats okay also than. are you bleeding down there?"" yes i am. ""okay sweety how bad is it?"" well i'm heaving my period, that is how bad it is.. ""oh yeah, i forgot, so that is normal also than."" 

she suggested to go to bed, and if i felt worse i could stop by, the fact that i pulled out my iud wasn't so different than when i would get it removed by a nurse, altough she tought that that ""would have happend more gently"" (no shit sherlock).

there is still the mistery of the lost tampon.. i think drunk me pulled it out earlier at night, but i have no clue.

so for not letting go drunken sexytime, i'm now not gonna have sexytime for a few weeks till i get a new iud. and because i didn't want to hear ""yo pussy so big"" jokes, now i'm gonna hear ""remember when you got so drunk and horny you pulled out your iud"" jokes forever. not to mention my parents now know i like drunken sexytime.. so yeah i fucked up today..

tl;dr

today i fucked up being on my period, getting drunk, and wanting sexytime. mistake my iud for my tampon, ripped it out after a 2 hour struggle, and woke up my parents to tell them i fucked up because i wanted to have dunken sexytime with husband. i did not get sexytime, nor will i get it for a few weeks.

edit: wow this really blew up after i went to sleep! glad to see my drunken efforts brought so much laughter! and its kinda nice to see al the shocked reactions, makes me feel a little less dumb for calling for my mommy in the middle of the night! 

some aditional info as requested:

- a iud is a form of birtcontrol, its like a 2cm big t shaped metal thingy which is placed in your uterus, on the bottom of the t is a little string that sticks out your uterus alllll the way up your vagina, so that they can remove it. 

- no thank god it didnt hurt (dont know if that was the wine of the fact that i gave birth to to kids)

- yes my funzone is (apart from some trust issues) okay!

- yes i'm fullt aware now that i didnt have to tell my parents i wanted sexytime, but drunken and horrified me couldnt care less at that moment.

- i'm 32 year old grown up mother of 2, and yes i called for my mommy

- i could have asked husband to remove the lost tampon, but i figured after that sexytime wouldnt be an option for him, and since that was the goal i didnt ask him. (thank god, cause this would have scarred him for life!)

- as for the lost tampon.. i have no idea, i must have drunkenly removed it earlier.. else it still dwells in the depths of erebor

thanks for al the support, shocked reactions, compliments, laughter, silver, gold and platinum! this made my fu a little less embarrasing!",4
"by almost having a gay threesome with my cousin and his husband.  

didn't happen today, on mobile, throwaway account etc.

my job requires me to travel a lot between the usa and canada - i have a 50/50 client split between the two places, so although i am based in los angeles, i fly into toronto every few weeks.

all of my family and friends are also in la, and i'm from a very conservative background, so when i realized at about age 12 that the thought of both girls and boys made me want to fiddle with my diddle, i kept the latter quiet to avoid being disowned by my father or giving my mom a heart attack. i've had plenty of girlfriends before and they're happy, i'm happy and there's no need to change that. anyway.

i headed out to toronto last friday morning for a few meetings. every now and then, i'll have meetings friday and monday, so i'll stay the weekend and have a little bit of a holiday in a nice hotel somewhere.

at about 4pm on friday, i had finished my work, checked into my hotel and was feeling a bit horny. anyone in the bi community will know it's easier to pickup guys then girls, so i downloaded grindr, created an account, uploaded a few pictures (without my face - half because i'm ugly and half because i don't want to be recognized) and did some browsing. some 20ish minutes in - i got a message. this guy was about my age, didn't have a picture, but gave me a description of himself and he sounded like a good way to spend my friday night.

we start to make a plan for 7pm and he mentions he's married and asks if i'd be interested in his husband coming along and having a little threesome action. now a threesome wasn't on my to-do list, but i'll give anything a go once so i said what the hell.

anyways, it comes around to 6:30pm and i get a call. i have two sim cards in my phone (one from canada and one from the usa). it's my cousin who lives in canada. i only speak to this guy probably 2-3 times a year, so it's a little weird, but not any cause for concern or anything and i was a bit busy at the time with some prep, so i let it go to vm. 60 seconds later, a txt. from my cousin:

&#x200b;

*""hi it's xxxxx from grindr. we're 2 minutes away, ok if we're a bit early?""*

&#x200b;

it took me about 30 seconds, but it clicks. canada. gay married cousin. the description matches. holy fucking shit, i just organised a threesome with my cousin.

i sat there in the bathroom, trying not to have a panic attack for a few minutes until my phone rings again. now obviously i'm not going to answer it, and i'm just praising god that i gave him my canadian number over grindr that he didn't have, and that i had him saved in my phone. the room phone begins to ring as well. holy shit.

i swear to god, i have never put on clothes so fast and bolted down 30 floors of stairs so fast. at the bottom of the staircase, i was straight through that fire door and hid in the nearest mcdonalds for the next 4 hours. 14 missed calls (10 from my cousin, 4 from hotel reception) and i took the sim card out of my phone and snapped it in half. found a new hotel room that night just in case. have to come up with an excuse for work and my clients as to why i need a new canadian number, but i think it was better than the other option...

&#x200b;

**tl;dr went to canada for work, wanted a quick hookup, didn't do my due diligence and almost ended up having a threesome with my gay cousin and his husband, ran away and hid in a mcdonalds for 4 hours**",4
"by not wearing a bra. today was a lounging, do-nothing day. i (22) watched some netflix in the living room while my brother (24) played games in his room and my older brother (27) had work. the evening came, my brother came home from work and went to talk with my other brother in his room. 

my mom called to ask what ingredients we had around the house so she can pick up stuff for dinner. an hour later she called to let me know she'll be home soon and my brothers and i have to dispute who has to help her bring groceries in. 

i went to my brothers, ""hey, you two have to pick which one of you have to help mom bring groceries in. she'll be home in 5 minutes."" i walked away like i was so clever, not including myself as an option. 

""why doesn't she help?"" i hear one say to the other. ""i dunno,"" the other says. 

a few minutes pass and the two of them came out of the room and approached me on the couch. 
""you grab the arms, i'll grab the legs?"" 
""yup.""

my older brother grabbed my ankles and the other my arms. i made it a little difficult though, i stiffened (which is probably easier) and i crossed my arms holding my elbows close to my torso so he didnt have anywhere to hold except a poor grip on my shoulders. 

being the weak noodle i am, i couldn't hold my arms in long enough. he grabbed my upper arms and they carried me toward the stairs to the front door. i half expected they wouldn't bring me outside, but i knew they would go all the way even when i had no jacket or shoes.

i didnt want to be carried awkwardly down the stairs so as we got closer, i struggled. i kicked my legs with little effort because i didnt want to hurt anyone, and since that didnt really work i had an idea. risky. i lifted my arms straight up so my brothers hands would lose grip an drop me. 

i dropped slowly since he was still trying to hold me with my arms up (i was wearing a long sleeve bunched at my elbows) but as i hit the floor i realized my shirt had lifted. my sleeves must have been pulled off my arms, lifting the rest.

it was over. my ankles were released. 

i put my now freed hands down over my chest and feel my nipple. yup. the brother by my feet definitely saw. i noticed he was looking away at the moment, but i was sure he saw when it happened. 

thankfully i am small chested, so i'm not as embarrassed as someone else would be. 
but it is still awkward to think about.

p.s. sorry bro....

tldr: decided not to wear a bra today. my brother saw my nipple. 


edit: i was home for the holidays from college, moving into a new place with my fiance this may. my brothers help support our single mom. stop assuming people are fuckups 👍🏻

why do people assume so many negative things lmao

"by cussing out 916 people.. this happened last night. 

so i'm a theatre kid at my high school and our first night of our play was last night. the day before, everyone on the cast was given brand new lav microphones (the wire mics that you tape to your face). unfortunately, i didn't know this. see, the old mics were only activated by the sound director, meaning it only worked if a switch on the sound board was flipped. the new ones, however, turn on automatically when you pass a certain area on stage. i think you can kind of see where this is going. 

so anyways, there was one part where i had to strip my costume (button-down shirt and khakis essentially) and change into a very pg-13 toga costume, then put my original costume back on as quickly as possible. so after i get up on stage, do my cute little toga thang, rush back offstage to return to my original outfit. once i was offstage, i began changing directly in front of the door i had just exited. this was because i had forgotten that someone else had to get on stage before i returned. so this asswipe rushes past me, and with the force of thor almighty, and swings the door wide open, exposing my asscheek to the entire cast and a good 40% of the audience. i freaked the fuck out and turned into patrick fucking star(https://youtu.be/kaqa2n_o-ke) as i ran to shut the door. here's the fu. 

so here i am, half naked, shivering, super embarrassed, i reached out to grab the doorknob. i made eye contact with the guy who had just made me flash all these poor people, and i instinctively gave him a good ol' fashioned american ""motherfucker!"". i swear to fucking god the door stretched as i was reaching for the doorknob, because next thing i know, i was on stage, pants still down, and heard a sea of gasps flood the auditorium. turns out the mic boundary was just barely passed where i was standing. so yes, the cast, the crew members above and behind me, as well as the 860+ wonderful audience members heard me loud and clear. on top of that, i didn't just say it, i screamed, so that shit echoed and bounced off the walls like crazy. here's what it was like from the audiences perspective:

""say, do you like canned salmon?""
""i'm quite fond of it, yes.""
*door opens*
""oh, there he is! this is my husb-""
*skinny asian boy with red boxers waddles on stage*
""motherfucker^fucker^^fucker^^^fucker!""
*door slams*
""....well....how do you do madame?""

safe to say i'll never be in another production at my school again. 

tl;dr- i unintentionally flashed like 200 people, then waddled with my pants at my ankles to close the door, screamed a vulgar word, and became the most infamous theatre student at my school. 

in words of the old western prospectors: gold! yeee-hawww!!! thanks, stranger!

edit- ok i don't know how mics work, sorry!
another edit- if you know who i am, shhhhh 
and another- numbers. ",4
"for going to the er for sucking dick. a couple months ago, it was date night with my bf and i was pumped to finally relax after a rough week. my boyfriend (who asked to be called magnum here 🙄 🙄so i'll refer to him as m) and i ended up making stuffed crust pizza. with grilled onions, sausage, and a fuck ton of cheese, it looks fucking amazing. so does m, so while waiting for it to bake, we head back to the bedroom to do things.

&#x200b;

after blowing him, i pulled off to swallow, but i couldn't -- my jaw was locked wide open!

&#x200b;

super embarrassed, i ran into the bathroom to get his cum out of my mouth. it was still stuck in the back of my throat, but i couldn't swallow or spit, so i tilted my mouth forward to allow his baby gravy to slowly drip out my mouth into the sink.

&#x200b;

we try everything—forcing my jaw shut with hands, aggressively wiggling it, massaging, praying to jesus to forgive me for my premaritial sins, but it's still stuck wide open. trying to make a little more tolerable, i took ibuprofen with wine, dumbly forgetting i can't swallow. so there i was, choking on his semen, wine, pills, and drool uncontrollably flowing out of my mouth. to make matters worse, m eats the pizza in front of me, it smells delicious, and obviously i can't have any.

&#x200b;

at \~4am, we give up the home remedies and uber to the er. i attempt to explain my situation to the receptionist with my mouth wide open and drool dripping onto my shirt. she's probably like, ""why is this guy taking advantage of this poor retarded girl?"" i write down that i'm nauseous and worried i'll die from sucking dick and choking on my own vomit, and get seen pretty quickly. we end up with an audience of about \~5 other curious doctors while this guy inspects my jaw.

&#x200b;

one asks, ""how did this happen?""

me: ...

another doctor: ""did you yawn?""

me: ...uh...yeah...

🤦‍♀️

&#x200b;

one doctor massages my neck while the other one sticks his hands into my mouth and pushes my back teeth back. it hurts like a bitch—this guy's applying his whole body weight into my teeth and i can feel his arms shaking as he leans into me.

&#x200b;

but then!! suddenly everything feels right again. it's all in place!!!

&#x200b;

we go home and the pizza is still good the next morning, and everything is okay. well, besides having to send an er bill home to my parents and explain that it was from dislocating my jaw :( m looked awfully smug the whole time, but i appreciated him coming w me to the er and letting me drool all over him

&#x200b;

tldr: dislocated my jaw by sucking dick. i had to go to the er at 4am, watch my bf eat the pizza we made together when i couldn't, and publicly humiliate myself

&#x200b;

edit: wow this hit the front page, can't bleieve this is my claim to fame",4
"by engaging with antivaxxers while grieving. obligatory this didn't actually happen today and i'm using a throwaway for reasons that will become clear below. a few months back, a young family member passed away unexpectedly. a social media post was put up about it, and it went viral. there were lots of kind people who commented nice and sometimes even helpful things, but there were also several with more maligned intentions: first spammers, then a few people who just wanted to speculate wildly about cause of death in very hurtful and insane ways, and then the anti-vax community descended on it.  the latter collectively wanted us to know that they ""knew"" what happened, that we could ""understand the tragedy"" better if we just talked to them. 

all of this was a lot to process in my grief, and i started going through comments and reporting them. my anger level rose and before long i convinced myself that if i just messaged them and told them that the autopsy showed something 100% unrelated, that they'd lay off. that we would maybe even get an apology. as i wrote the first message, i convinced myself that people are decent and they just misunderstood probably. i continued writing to a few others. 

yeah.... couldn't have been more wrong about that. i got back messages from each with different insane takes on it. then i started getting messages from other people i've never heard of. 

at the private, unannounced service, two women came up to me in the parking lot wanting to hug. i assumed they were from the other side of the family, people i'd met but i just wasn't immediately recalling them, so i obliged. they expressed their sorrow, asked a few questions, and then began explaining that they had ""research"" that they'd like to share. one pulled out pages of handwritten notes about the dangers of vaccinations and how it relates to the deceased. thankfully the employees of the funeral home helped me dispense of them quickly at least. 

i continued getting messages on social media and later learned that my info had been spreading from one social media group to another along with the any details they'd gleaned about the death from me. i eventually started getting phone calls even, though my phone number isn't out there in any easy to find place.  one person went to the length to write up over 20 pages of ""facts"" about the death including a section on how my loved one's death can further their cause politically. i couldn't even be mad; at least she was honest in her intention unlike the others. it's been months, and still i'm being hounded almost every single day by crazies all over the country. 

i've learned my lesson and don't respond or acknowledge them in any way now, nor have i for a while.  i haven't mentioned this to any of my family members because we're all so broken right now and this is way too much on top of it; i just hope none of them are getting the same treatment. 

tl;dr anti-vaxxers have been trying to ruin my life since i tried to reason with them after the passing of a loved one


edit - a few takeaways:
* to those that reached out with similar experiences, i have been mortified to learn that this wasn't unique to me. thank you for trusting me with your thoughts and stories.  i wish each of you the very best. 
* to those that reached out who have also lost a loved one recently, thank you. genuinely. that's a brave thing to talk about with a stranger online, and it's been really healing for me to have conversations with so many of you. 
* i regret the user name i chose for this post and the wording of my tl;dr. i do believe in vaccinating but am sad to realize my words were a catalyst in spurring so much hatred towards those who don't.  the people that doxxed me are on the extreme fringe of that group, and that has become even more clear to me reading comments and messages from some of you.  i'm going to try to parlay this whole experience of wishing for more kindness from strangers during a tough time to trying to be as kind as i can be to strangers (and everyone else for that matter),  online and otherwise.",4
"by letting my wife nair my butt. the male community is pretty split on the forest vs clearing debate when it comes to bums. i happen to like a well manicured booty. normally, i use a trimmer with no gaurd because it's fast and trying to manuver a razor back there is far too risky. i do this every couple of weeks or so.

the downside to this method is that it doesnt get super close and leaves a a little butt stubble. i was lamenting this fact to my wife when she lit up and offered up a genius solution. ""you should let me nair your butt."" said she, with a gleam in her eyes. ""its easier than a trimmer and it will make your butt super smooth.""

""well, okay."" says i.

elated, she runs to grab the tube, sits down face level with my butt and goes to town with a little more fervor than you would expect for someone tasked with rubbing cream on a hairy man butt. marriage is strange. a few minutes later, i wash it off in the shower and we gush over how baby-smooth things are down there. i mean a baby dolphin would be jealous of this thing. it was like silk and rubber got together for a night of sweet love and produced an offspring. i finally understood what that santara song was about. all was good in the world. or so i thought.

the next day i noticed some slight itchiness, but i figured it would pass, so i just tried to ignore it and focused on not scratching it as best as i could. later that night, my wife and i got undressed and got in the shower together. we were having an unrelated conversation, when i remembered the itchiness i had been feeling throughout the day and told her about it. ""well turn around so i can take a look."" so i turned around, stuck it out, and awaited her analysis.

...

dead silence. 

i turned back around to find her with her hands over her mouth trying her hardest to hold in a laugh. i craned my neck and twisted my body to try to get a view myself, and i was met with a horrifying sight. like a thief in the night, somone had stolen the silky smooth booty that was there just mere hours before and replaced it with one that was covered in huge, bright red bumps. unable to contain it any longer, my wife busted out laughing, while i jumped out of the shower to inspect it closer in the mirror. overnight, it had gone from glorious, shimmering dolphin fin to 14 year old getting slapped in the face by puberty.

my wife maintains the hypothesis that it was an alergic reaction to the hotel soap possibly somehow exacerbated by the nair, as i did get a few small bumps on other parts of my body, but nothing like the warzone that my backside now looks like.

i maintain that it was sabatoge because she was jealous and wanted to have the only smooth bum in the house.

moral of the story: never challenge a woman's rightful status of smoothest booty. 

tl;dr: i let my wife nair my butt and now it looks like freddy kruger face fucked a topographical map of utah.",4
"by blowing my man too enthusiastically nsfw. this happened the past night, technically already today.

we were having some adult fun with the boyfriend. it was also after a couple of drinks so we were going at it pretty rough.
so here i am, on my knees, giving him a blowjob, putting my back into it when all of a sudden i hear a very loud *pop* immediately followed by one of the worst pain i ever felt. it felt as if someone stabbed me in the face with a screwdriver. 

thanks to my godlike reflexes i was able to yank my head away from the one eyed yogurt slinger before my teeth snapped together and with that momentum i also managed to slam my head into the nearest wall. i was already in tears from the shock of the sudden pain when i realised.. i can't move my jaw. i started to panic and just kept repeating ""i can't open my mouth! i can't open my mouth!"".

we tried to pry it open while under hot water, thinking it was a muscle cramp but that shortly, with some pain i can't even start to describe, revealed that it indeed was not just some stiff muscle... 

yup, i managed to dislocate my jaw while giving a blowjob.

in a futile attempt to snap it back where it belongs, i tried punching myself in the face on the opposite side, tried pushing it, pulling it with all my might but none of that seemed to work. at the end after many tears and pain and panicked running in circles, i took a painkiller and wrapped myself in a blanket to think through my options. i ended up falling asleep like that for a few hours. 

when i woke again, with the pain a bit duller and my mind a bit clearer i finally managed to pop my jaw back where it belongs but the pain is still very bad and i can't open my mouth more then to fit a teaspoon neither can i close it completely. it being sunday, only emergency trauma care is accessible in the hospital and it is insanely crowded so i decided to wait till tomorrow to seek medical attention. so here i am now, popping painkillers and eating my dinner with a straw, having absolutely no idea what i am going to say to the doctor or how do i explain to my boss why i need a day off in such short notice.

tl,dr: i went for a blowjob, ended up like the t-rex after king kong was done with it.

edit/update: first of all... holy sh** this blew up! i'm glad i could make so many of you chuckle. also, i've read the comments, thanks for the laughs, it hurt.

to answer a couple topics i found in the comments: sadly, nobody came that day. 

what was boyfriend doing, well, he tried to call an ambulance after he realised we are not equipped to fix the issue. problem is, my country is not very big on english and my boyfriend doesn't speak the local language. first operator hang up on him when realised he is trying to communicate in english, second operator got stuck on not understanding the address code in english... i then insisted to ""f**k that, it'll be fine"".

i am not from the us, just very stupid. health care is included in taxes but did not rush to the er because they are under staffed, under payed and over worked an i was not bleeding, seriously disabled or in mortal danger, neither did i think a dislocated jaw is serious enough to require immediate care, tho reading your horror stories and warnings made me concerned.

after a brief ~4 hours spent at the clinic i was called into a large room where five dentists were working on five different patients with not as much as a curtain separating them so the place was loud enough that the doctor did not ask questions because i was not able to answer loud enough. he instructed me to grip the chair tight because it will hurt, pushed my jaw backwards and wiggled it to it's place. showed me how to stretch the muscles, gave me his number and sent me off.

hopefully it will heal alright and i can go back to finish what i was doing originally.

oh, and bless those who noticed the username. i did make this account to post this story. wasn't sure how it would look on my main.",4
"by calling my girlfriend a thot. this happened yesterday, but anyways here goes.

yesterday, there was a magic the gathering tournament at my local hobby shop.  my girlfriend decided to tag along and come support me.  i ended up doing pretty poorly (1-3), but the hobby shop gave out a consolation prize of a random foiled uncommon card.  the card that i received was called ""thought erasure"" and immediately held the card up to my girlfriend and said ""and i cast thought erasure, be gone thot!"" as a joke, but said it pretty loudly.  the shop is pretty small and a lot of people caught wind of my act and needless to say my girlfriend was very embarrassed.  we're home now and she still hasn't spoken to me. i'm fucked boys.


tl;dr: casted thot erasure on my girlfriend and now i'm afraid it may have worked. 

update: girlfriend broke up with me. :(

"by mishearing what my teacher said to me. this happened to me 21 years ago!so, halfway through grade 4, my family and i moved from texas to colorado. to help me get accustomed to my new classmates and not be overwhelmed on my first day, my teacher had me come in early and sit at my desk while the other students came in. while i was nervously awaiting the arrival of my new classmates my teacher walked over and gave me a warning.

""now, the girl in front of you is a dork. please don't make fun of her.""

hearing this, the nine-year-old me instantly came to this poor girl's defence. the teacher had just called her a dork, and i thought this was extremely mean. so i tried to help this unmet girls aid by showing our camaraderie to the teacher:

""that's okay, there's nothing wrong with that. in fact, i used to be one too!"" after admitting this to my teacher i was suddenly overcome with a fear that teacher would think of me as a dork forever, abandoning my plan of trying to help this girl i quickly added, ""but then i grew out of it.""

the teacher gave me the most puzzled look i have ever seen and seemed like she was about to say more but decided against it and left.all the kids came in and sat down at their desk and i looked up at the girl in front of me and realized i had misheard what my teacher said. the girl wasn't a dork; she was a dwarf. i had just told the teacher i used to be a dwarf, but i had grown out of it.

tl;dr misheard the teacher and then told her i used to be a dwarf but grew out of it.

"half of 2019. *throwaway because only reddit can know that my life is written and directed by adam sandler.* 

**list of fuck ups i've experienced so far - the 2019 issue:**

1.

mispronounced my new girlfriend's name when i introduced her to old friends of mine.

2.

dropped an f bomb during an important job interview when i accidentally bit my own tongue.

3.

ignored my broken tooth for weeks and ended up in hospital with inflamed and infected gums. 

4.

changed my instagram name to @onetruegenuis and realized i misspelled 'genius' when several of my friends and colleagues jumped on the chance to point out the irony of my illiteracy. 

5.

unknowingly opened a dick pic sent to me from my father who thought he was sending that shit to my mom. 

6.

speaking of dick, somehow drunk me managed to get his poor balls stuck on his zipper twice in one night (the second time i had to call my best friend for a helping hand: i said no homo, he did not). 

7.

took a random ride on my younger cousin's bmx bike, sat my ass down mid-ride, and was painfully reminded there was nothing but exposed steel to fucking sit on (tl:dr got butt raped by bmx).

8.

suffered an asthma attack while masturbating in the shower and almost blacked out while waiting for my dick to defuse before i had the courage to call my roommate for my inhaler. 

9.

visited my sister in law who told me not to freak out if her pet bird decides to fly over to sit on my shoulder. the bitch fucking flew like 10 seconds later and i freaked the fuck out. i dodged the damn bird on instinct and inadvertently caused it to fly face first into the window behind me. it survived, but my sister in law made damn sure i didn't.

"by microwaving a chef boyardee on an active military base. as with most things this happened last week. i'm currently deployed in the middle east. we got off work a little later than expected and missed the galley hours so we stopped at the mini mart on base to grab some food. they have a decent selection mostly just your typical gas station food. so some guys grab cold sandwiches or microwavable burritos, i decided to go for the chef boyardee classic spaghetti and meatballs. now you have to heat you food at the mini mart because they don't trust us with microwaves in our rooms. you'll understand why soon enough. i put my spaghetti in the microwave and set the timer.  we are just bullshiting in the mini waiting for our food when all of a sudden a loud bang what sounded like a gunshot goes off behind us and without skipping a beat there were 4 marines m16s raised yelling at everybody to get down as they make their way through the shop clearing the isles straight towards us. that's when i realized i forgot to remove the metal top from the spaghetti. i had to show them the inside of the microwave now covered in spaghetti sauce and meatballs before they finally relaxed and put their guns down. i ended cleaning the microwave and buying a second chef boyardee.

"by being too horny for my boyfriends good nsfw. obligatory happened a couple days ago

i was enjoying a lovely morning with my boyfriend. talking, cuddling, farting together... you know the drill. just the comfortable phase of relationship when you no longer worry about being perfect human beings.
well, after some cuddling, i noticed that his morning wood wasn't gone. at all. and even though we had some amazing sex last night, i decided i wanted more. he was just so sexy, laying in his bed, i couldn't resist.

after some teasing, we went to do it. we're pretty boring, maybe too romantic and really lazy, so we wanted just a classic missionary. ya know, nothing too wild. but i want it quick and kinda rough.

while we were doing it, i'm telling him to speed up, even though i know he is tired from yesterday. and he does.

suddenly, he tells me he got a cramp in his back. okay, i thought, it will go away. it will be fine. it's just a cramp. let's continue. right?

wrong.

he stopped. his face looked like he was in a lot of pain. his whole body looked like he was in a lot of pain. and he was still  inside of me.

then he told me:""babe? i can't move. it hurts. i think i'm gonna need help.""

well.

i had to carefully operate myself from under him and take off his condom. i also had to try not to burst out laughing because of the absurdity or crying because he was in pain. 

the best part? trying to put his pants up, so he won't be totally naked when the fucking ambulance i had to call will arrive. the whole time he was almost screaming from pain.

the really best part? trying to frantically get rid off all evidence of what we were doing just for him to tell everyone ""yeah, i did this to myself during morning sex with my girlfriend.""

now he is stuck in bed for a week and i'm wondering if my pussy was really worth calling ambulance and all that pain.

tldr; my vagina apparently feels so good my boyfriend got an acute lumbago in his back while being in it.

edit: guys, the tldr was a sarcasm and a joke.

edit 2: aaaand he laughs about it now too. he was the one asking me to cover him so noone else would see him bare naked. he also saw this post before i submitted it (even told me to put it on reddit, because it is kinda funny) and is the one making most jokes about it. at the moment it was terrifying, but now he´s okay, so why shouln´t we laugh about it?",4
"by playing a jackbox game with my girlfriend's family. a little background: my girlfriend's family is extremely conservative. like goes-to-church-twice-every-sunday-and-never-swears conservative. while they are really nice people, it's a challenge for my heathen self to successfully endure a whole weekend with them without saying something that brings shame to my name. onward...

so earlier tonight, my girlfriend's family decided to play some games together. we settled on drawful (a game that allows you to draw things from your phone). this is where things go south... 

after choosing our character names, you have to draw your character. seems cool, right? however, this is my first time playing and everyone failed to mention that once you start drawing, you can't erase. so being the funny guy i am, i draw this huge, veiny dick and secretly show it to my girlfriend in front of me. we have a good laugh because we both knew damn well that her family would be mortified if it showed up on the screen. as a joke, my girlfriend pretends to hit ""submit,"" on my phone. in reality, she really did hit submit. next thing i know, my character name pops up on the tv with a huge, contoured schlong. there was no mistaking this beauty, either. i feel my heart skip a beat. i looked around and accidentally make eye contact with her 12-year-old sister, who looks at me with a disappointment unmatched by anything i've experience before.

i panic. i try to exit out of the game, but my dick-asso masterpiece remains in the center of the screen. i stare at my phone to avoid the look from her parents. i try to pretend that i have no idea what happened. 

the game starts and every round, without fail, my pork sword drawing makes it way around the screen. i don't say a single word. the room is uncomfortably silent. i hear the occasional giggle from my girlfriend, and i'm doing my best not to explode inside.

the game finally ends after what feels like a year. i select the new character screen and her dad says, ""what? you don't want to keep your big penis on there? jesus would be so proud on this easter weekend.""

safe to say my girlfriend (more her family) isn't the one for me. 

tl;dr: i played jackbox's drawful with my girlfriend's family. i joking drew a huge dick as my character and my girlfriend accidentally submitted it. so there i was on the tv, identifiable as a veiny dick in front my girlfriend's sheltered, conservative family...


edit: the comment about her not being the one for me was sarcastic. we've been together for almost two years. i'm just mortified to show my face to her dad for a while",4
"by telling the grocery store they needed to get rid of their new, loud, automated door greeter.. this happened last week. i was in a hurry to get to the grocery store pharmacy to pickup a prescription about 20 minutes before work. i pulled into the parking lot, walk through the door, and i hear in an automated, loud, voice, ""thank you for shopping at safeway!""  
slightly startled by the unexpected greeting, i continue to the pharmacy at the back of the store. multiple times i hear, ""welcome to safeway!"" and ""thank you for choosing your local safeway."" and i think to myself how annoying this booming robo greeter was.  
  
  after i pickup my script, i grab a couple other quick items and proceed to the u-scan to check out and i am constantly hearing this booming robo-voice. after i finish at u-scan and turn to leave i see a manager speaking to the u-scan clerk and decide to take the opportunity to tell her, ""you guys have got to get rid of that robot greeter. that thing is soooooo annoying!""    
the manager looks at me like i'm a fucking monster and says, ""there is no way we are getting rid of sarah! she isn't going anywhere!""       
  
confused and surprised i bit my tongue and gave her a look like like she's crazy and go to leave, running the confusion through my head, looking down as i walk. then i go to exit and hear the robo greeter thanking me for shopping, and i look up. turns out the robo-greeter sarah is a human woman named sarah with als or some kind of similar hawking-esque catastrophic disability. she was using a computer tablet attached to her wheelchair to select greeting messages for customers as they enter and exit.   my stomach immediately sank and my face turned red as i walked back out to my car in shock at my own assholery...

tl;dr i told the grocery store to fire their robo-greeter that was actually a severely disabled woman.   
  
edit - just to clarify, i think this is hysterical now. i find great hilarity at my own blunder, which is why i decided to share. i'm not going to a different store. i have no shame in going back there at all.

"playing porn for my family through the echo on xmas morning. writing this from the bathroom as i just realized what happened. 

home for the holidays. my family got an amazon alexa a couple of years ago, and my parents never quite figured out how to actually make it work. it used to be set up under my account, but when i moved out last year i transferred everything to my mom. it's in the kitchen, and she mostly uses it for timers while cooking. 

our family likes off-beat christmas music, and i spent a while some time back curating it all on to a special spotify playlist for us. we like to listen to it as we have brunch and open presents on christmas morning. 

here's where the fu starts. yesterday i wanted to play a new song i heard for my mom. i couldn't get the echo to find it, so i had to connect my phone via bluetooth. the family all got new phones a month ago, so there were no devices automatically connected. i paired my phone and played the song. 

this morning, before a long day of family, small talk, presents and whatnot, i was mentally preparing myself for the day in my childhood bed. you know, relieving some stress.... with videos. oddly enough none of the videos i stumbled upon had sound. i wrote it off as shoddy sources and finished the deed. 

when i came downstairs to say good morning and merry christmas to the family, my sister greets me with ""you need to play the playlist from your phone, i can't get the echo to connect to my phone."" ""okay, no problem, i'll connect my phone."" ""i was trying to connect mine, and i think yours is already connected.""

not sure what my family heard playing over the echo this morning, but it wasn't my usual christmas playlist. 

tl;dr paired my new phone to my family's echo yesterday. went to tug one out this morning in my childhood bed, and i'm pretty sure that soundtrack blasted in the kitchen for my family. ",4
"by peeing all over my first kiss and immediately legging it. not today, about 9 years ago. this story is one that stills keeps me awake at night begging for death.

**backstory**

i was 15, just an awkward high schooler from the suburbs of melbourne. i wasn't popular by any means, but i had a few good mates and while none of us had a girlfriend, we were always full of bullshit stories about our sexual conquests. ""oh, she's from another school you don't know her"", ""it was on holiday"", ""and then her friend joined in"", etc. between us we must have fucked half the female population of australia before hitting 16. but in reality all of us probably would have killed each other if it meant a shot at ditching the v plates.

anyway, as the school year's finishing up and everyone's gearing up for summer, there's talk about some of the popular kids heading out of town on a bit of a camping trip, out on this king-of-the-jocks types cousins farm. everyone wanted in. a big piss up away from adults filled with the hottest girls from our year? come on. if us boys could score an invite we'd finally be able to prove to each other just how much game we had.

i wasn't so naive as to actually bother asking for an invite. there was no chance of us getting a look in, we simply did not have that kind of status. but then, on the first day of the summer break, one of the guys hits me up with a text; ""we're in, pack your shit."" fortunately for us, his much cooler sister from the year below ours had been immediately invited, and through the age old art of sibling blackmail, he'd wrestled the details out of her. it wasn't an invite per se, but we knew where to go and i doubt we rated high enough to even bother asking to leave.

due to the nature of the impending debauchery, we had absolutely no interest in our parents catching on to the vibe of the trip and decided to get ourselves there. an hour and a half on the train out of town, a bus ride and about a thirty minute walk later we arrive at the campsite. it wasn't really a farm, it was just this massive property that made money as a sort of backup scout camp most of the year, but the owner was letting us have it for the weekend while it was empty.

we shouldn't have worried about not getting an invite, it seemed like half the year level had rocked up. looking back i honestly have no idea how a group of 14-16 year olds got their hands on as much alcohol as they did but this thing was **stocked**. we were on some *project x* shit, a whole bunch of sex crazy teenagers out in the sticks drinking themselves stupid. this was my first experience properly drinking, and despite my apparent long list of sexual conquests, my first time really hanging out with girls.



**the pissening**

one of the great things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down social barriers and make you realise that most people are actually pretty cool once they drop the act. one of the terrible things about binge drinking is how it tends to break down urinal barriers and make you realise that no matter how recently you took a piss, you're gonna be busting for another in no time.

for example, late into the evening, i found myself sitting on a log, alone with a girl i'd never have had to balls to speak to before. a classic popular high school girl, way out of my league. but here we were, her downing vodka from the bottle, me sinking tinnies (of sweet, sugary, girly cider).

things get a little blurry, but i remember getting increasingly closer and closer until we were making out. we were pretty awkwardly positioned on this log, and in an attempt to disguise my own overly excited log i was sort of leaning forward with my arm tucked into my stomach. my elbow was pushing up hard against my bladder. i suddenly became aware of a desperate need to pee, but i wasn't gonna be a fucking idiot by ending this action to get up and go empty the tank. i needed to be stoic. i could pee when i'm dead.

my unwelcome rock hard guest was at this point making a pretty good go of trying to break free from my pants, and this girl could tell. to my teenage delight, rather than retracting in horror she didn't seem to mind and decided to work with it. unzip. pull free. spit in the hand. she knew what she was doing. but the unrelenting excitement that should have been my first handjob became sheer panic as i felt the flood gates reaching breaking point. within milliseconds, the thought left my brain and travelled south.

before the words ""oh shit stop"" could leave my mouth i became a human super soaker, releasing a veritable niagara falls skyward into the small space between us. by the time she'd pulled away in drunken horror, my liquid fury was all over both of us. her face was contorted into a mixture of confusion and rage, and before either one of us says anything i'm on my feet running for the hills, attempting to tuck my still flowing hose away. she's yelling after me, ""what the fuck is wrong with you?"", as people look over at the chaos.

after hiding away in my tent for a short time, king-of-the-jocks less than politely told me that it was time for me to leave and to take my guys with me. they were not impressed. i called my dad to come and pick us up at two in the morning. he was not impressed. as for the girl? the reputation that followed me around school for the following three years makes me think that she was, in fact, not impressed. 

**tl;dr** things were getting a little wild post my first make out sesh with a hot girl, but after foolishly ignoring my bladder liquid gold rained down on the both of us and i ran like the wind. got myself and my mates kicked out of the party of the year, and had my dad drive an hour and a half out at 2am to pick us up.

edit: thanks for my first ever (non liquid) gold!

edit 2: to all those asking about my ability to take a piss while standing to attention, i dunno what to tell you. is it a super power? am i broken? we may never know. but i can safely say that i don't partake often due to urine related ptsd.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**follow up:** thanks for all the kind words, i'm glad this harrowing moment of adolescence made you laugh. i can't reply to all the comments but to those asking what happened to the girl, i don't think we ever spoke again but still saw each other in classes and stuff, just forever avoiding eye contact. as for my group of mates, it didn't take them too long to forgive me, and it eventually just became one of those story's that is brought up at every possible opportunity. i still get roasted for it.",4
"by showing my tinder date's mom my bare ass.. obligatory it happened a month ago. 

i started hooking up with this guy from tinder. he lives with his brother in an apartment, and his mother comes occasionally to spend time with them. 

we decided to indulge in a little herb smoking one saturday night. the munchies kicked in around 2am so we made some potato wedges in the air fryer. came back and spooned to sleep. 

i wake up the next morning, with his morning wood pressed to my butt. this, for some reason turned me on and we proceeded to have lazy spooning sex at 6:30am.  

midway through it, we heard his apartment's main door open. tinder dude stopped and got up, confused. i was still lying on the bed, wearing his t-shirt and boxers, which were pulled down to my knees. ass visible, in all it's glory. 

now i was still under the impression that his room's door was locked. i was wrong. his mother opened the door and i swear she had the same expression as the shocked pikachu meme. :o

she immediately closed the door. i ran to the washroom and got dressed, and hid inside for a good 20 minutes trying to figure out if jumping from the washroom window would be a good escape plan or not. 

turns out she came early to take the dog (who was in the same room as us the entire time) for her vet appointment. 

i left as soon as she left.

she later had a conversation with her 22 year old son about consent, and respecting women. she asked him if i was his girlfriend, to which he had to explain his very catholic mother that ""we're just two friends trying to figure things out"". 

spoiler: we ended up dating. thankfully his mother joked it off the next time we met saying ""hi, i'm *****, tinder guy's mom. i didn't get a chance to introduce myself the last time we met."" (chuckles). 

tl;dr: tinder date and i got too baked and forgot to lock the room. woke up the next morning to pip pip the diddly doo and got walked in on by the dude's mum. and that's the story of how my now so's mom saw my bare ass before she could see my face first.

ps:  we never ate the wedges and he found them lying in the air fryer a week later. 

edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

edit 2: holy shit i can't believe this blew up. my account is juuuusssttt 4 days old. man i love reddit. 

edit 3: this one's more like a clarification. i live in a non first world country where it's fairly common for people to live with their parents/for parents to come over. his mom was supposed to pick the dog up to take her to the vet, and was being nice by not wanting to wake her son up. she had the house keys, which is again, fairly normal here. we were dumbasses.

"by not knowing courtrooms had dress codes.. for those of you that are as unaware as i am, don't wear shorts, flip flops, or hats into court. i went to go pay a ticket (expired tags) at my scheduled time and saw ""no shorts, flip flops, hats, untucked shirts..."" in bold letters on the door. fortunately for me, the front desk had extra slacks on hand for this very thing. unfortunately for me, the slacks were a size 32, and i haven't been a size 32 since high school... i'm a big guy who's been ""blessed"" with thick thighs (heard they're in style). these slacks were so tight, i couldn't zip them past the first rung. all i could do was throw my belt on, cinch it tight, and throw my shirt over it all to hide the undesirables. these things looked like yoga pants on me.

i'd guess about 30 people were in the court room, spread out amongst the benches. i was capable of slipping behind everyone without them seeing and sitting on the back bench. one lady enters right before go time and asks me to scoot back so she could get by. i said ""ma'am, if i bend my legs i'll bust these pants wide open."" she looks down, sees my pants and starts snickering, then steps over me. 

after the judge said his speech, he began to call people 1 by 1 as they said their plea. he allowed us to stand where we were and shout our plea towards him (win). everyone before me requested a conference. i was fourth to be called. 

judge: ""qtvain how do you plea?""

me: ""guilty, sir. i would just like to pay my ticket.""

judge: ""alright, that's 100 dollars, please step up to the front, sign this document and the officer will escort you to the cashier.""

me: *panicking* ""uh yes, sir""

as i'm waddling up to the front, it really dawned on me that i looked like a bum off a three day bender. flip flops (that were clearly not allowed), the tightest pants you've ever seen on a man, and an untucked t-shirt. i'm starting to hear people fighting back laughter as i walk by every damn bench.

judge: ""didn't meet the dress code huh?""

me: ""sir, these people behind me know more about my body than i do right now. i'd really like to pay my ticket and go.""

judge: ""ha, fair enough. get outta here.""

i waddled out of there as quickly as i could and threw my shorts on in the bathroom. told my wife what happened when i got home. ""yah i thought it was weird you went into court with shorts, i was going to tell you but forgot.""

""thanks babe.""


tl;dr check your local courts dress code before attending. i didn't, and wore the wrong attire. 

edit: hey y'all, i get it. i should have thought about it. i'm just your standard law-abiding citizen who has never experienced the inside of a courtroom before. can we not be so hostile? i was just trying to show the judge a little leg.

edit 2: i'm trying to respond to all of y'all asking me questions. to further clarify, i thought i had to show up to the courthouse to pay the ticket, i didn't actually believe i had to see the judge. i was headed to work after the visit, and my job has a really, really lax dress code. hope this helps, my fingers are getting tired.

edit 3: thank y'all for the gold! i've honestly enjoyed chatting with so many of you. reddit, you're beautiful (even the random little shit stains that comment). i tried to respond to as many of you as i could. my fingers are actually hurting now. i'll comment more tomorrow. ",4
"by connecting to my housemates bluetooth speaker while she was having sex. this happened yesterday but i didn't really know how to explain it until know.

by the time she brought him over, i was in my bed trying to fall asleep. her room is right beside mine so i was already thinking that i would be able to hear them, but i just figured they would try to be quiet. once they got to her room, i could hear the bed creaking a couple minutes after. me being tired and wanting to drown out the noise, i decided ""i'll just put on my bluetooth headphones so i can't hear them."" now usually my phone auto-connects to my headphones, but this time was different. i saw that my phone had connected to something, but didn't bother checking that it was my headphones.

i opened instagram for a nice nightly browse, only to find out that the first video on my timeline wasn't playing audio. i thought my phone volume was low so i turned it all the way up. i was genuinely confused but began to hear a faint noise through the wall. by the time i realized my headphones weren't playing audio, it was too late; the monsters inc. theme started playing extremely loud from the other room. i promptly disconnected my phone and i hear a bang on my wall following a scream of ""legogh\_, is that you fucking with my speaker?!?"" i was speechless, i didn't say anything because i couldn't believe what had just happened.

it turns out that earlier in the day, i had connected to her speaker to play music and that's what my phone auto-connected too. after the guy left her room, i tried to explain to her what happened but she is convinced that i intentionally did it. they didn't even finish having sex because i killed the mood, and now she's extremely pissed off at me.

tldr; accidentally connected to my housemates bluetooth speaker while she was having sex and i watched a meme with the monsters inc. theme in it

edit: she isn't mad anymore, my other housemates brought it up last night and we all had a good laugh

edit2: broke it into paragraphs for an easier read

edit3: also to clarify, it was the earrape version(https://youtu.be/irp-2y43blo) of the theme song",4
"by misunderstanding my grandpa for my entire life. this fuck up has been going on my entire life but it just hit me last week so here it goes.

my grandpa is from the south, so he has a bit of an accent and on top of that he's soft-spoken. this paired with my terrible hearing is a diabolical combination. since i can remember, whenever he sees me he always has said ""hey! wanna color?"" in a really fast manner. which young me always politely declined. throughout the years this has continued. i always said no thank you because i have shaky hands and my coloring skills are subpar. plus, maybe he loves coloring i mean hey, if that's his thing then so be it even though i've never once seen him color.

then last week it dawned on me. he approached me and said  **""hey! wanna color?""**  at least that's what i registered at first but then i deciphered it correctly. he was actually saying  **""hey there young feller""**  .. i  instantly became red in the face in embarrassment. for my entire life i have been responding to my grandpas greeting with no thank you.. i explained the fuck up to him and we both had a good laugh but man i'm never going to live this down.

edit: to clear things up people keep asking how would i confuse the two phrases? he talks very quickly, quietly, and has a unique accent. so the two together sound somewhat similar. for those saying this is made up i guess believe what you want? i'm not sure why i'd make up such a strange story.

thanks for the silver!!


tl;dr; grandpa has always said ""hey wanna color?"" which i always responded with no thank you. he's actually been saying ""hey there young feller"". i've misheard him my entire life.",4
"by peeing in a girls mouth thinking i was ejaculating.. me and this girl met up after ages of speaking on snapchat (about 6 months), with the whole intent to have sex. 

&#x200b;

she gets to my house and we talk for a bit and things are going well, things go to things and were kissing, then sex, you know the usual. after a few struggles of putting on a condom (never had used one before) i was able to fuck her and it went well. i came and threw the condom in the bin. 

&#x200b;

this is where it gets fucked, shes sucking on my dick, i feel as if im about to cum again, thinking to myself thats kind of weird because i dont usually cum is such quick succession but i go along with it. i feel as if im about to do it and end up what i think is ejaculating in her mouth. i could not be anymore wrong.  


i ended up peeing in her mouth for a few seconds, she swallowed that, and then took my dick out thinking i was done, pee shot out of my dick on her boobs, she realised, i realised, i panicked so hard and immediately got her into my shower taking off the rest of her clothes.

&#x200b;

grabbed a towel and made her drink some mouthwash and gave her a glass of water, i was on my feet the whole time and she wasnt even making a big deal about it, i felt like utter shit

&#x200b;

in the end she said the sex was good and that she heard about times her friends had that happen to her, told her i'd go to the toilet before fucking next time, and we are all good now.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - thought i was ejaculating for a second time in a girls mouth, ended up peeing and she swallowed some.",4
"by putting a vibrator on my boss's desk. this didn't happen today, but years ago. i worked at an insurance agency.  it was a small office with a receptionist and a few insurance producers.  we were a tight knit group and would frequently joke around with no subjects being off limits. not your typical professional environment.

one of the producers, we'll call her lisa, had a boyfriend named dick.  lisa was a recent divorcee and her relationship with dick was very on again off again.  at the time this happened, they were fighting and not really speaking.

around the holidays we did an office grab bag thing.  i picked lisa's name out of the hat.  i decided that since she and dick weren't​ in a good spot and that she complained about how horny she was all the time, i'd get her a vibrator as her gift.  this thing was thick, about 8"", black, and had a gold tip.  

so we do the grab bag and everyone has a good laugh that lisa got a vibrator.  we're chasing each other around the office with it and having a grand old time.  as things die down, it got put on the boss's desk.

picture the things on a regular office desk...computer, stapler, some files, pens, phone etc... and a big black and gold vibrator.  a woman comes in to buy a homeowners policy and says: i have an appointment with boss.  boss had no idea the vibrator was on his desk until he and the woman went into his office and sat down.

the rest of us in the office immediately realize what was happening and we lost it.  there is 0% chance the woman didn't see it.  somehow, boss was able to stoically make it through the sale unscathed.  neither he or the customer acknowledged the giant gold tipped dong.  more so, this was the woman's first house and sales like that usually take a little longer as additional documents are needed for the closing and we would usually take extra time to explain the policy as insurance can be confusing to first time buyers.

the lady leaves and boss comes out red as a tomato.  he's not even pissed because he realizes how funny the situation is...and he still made the sale.  

i've always wondered if that woman ever tells the story about buying a homeowners policy with a vibrator on the desk. 

sounds like the story is over.... not quite.  lisa put the vibrator in her glove box.  a few days later her 8 year old son was rummaging around in her car, found it, turned it on and walked into her house rubbing it on his face saying: look mom, i'm shaving!

i think it might have gotten thrown in the garbage after that.

tl;dr: put vibrator on boss's desk, he didn't know and conducted business with customer. then a 8 year old boy thought it was an electric razor and rubbed it all over his face.

edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger(s)!
 matches the vibrator lol.",4
"by accidentally giving my entire family an indirect unholy facial update. two days back, this(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ael0wt/tifu_by_using_holy_sanctified_oil_as_lube/) happened.
here's the **tl;dr** from it:
used oil as lube, accidentally shot semen into the bottle. turns out oil had religious incantations recited upon to ward off evil, and grandpa will be using it tonight on his hair and beard.

right after the post, a lot of people asked me to throw the oil away but i hesitated because my grandpa had apparently been feeling better ever since he started using the oil even before i came in it, so i didn't know how to waste it. i could've asked the imam (local mosque leader) to do the same stuff he did on the oil in a new bottle, but he's out of town for this month. so i just put the bottle where it was and he even used it once right after, unfortunately.

next two days, i stayed over at my cousin's place and just got back this morning. right as i came back, mom recommended me to massage my hair with the oil given by the imam as it felt ""soothing"". as she was saying it, i visualised my demonic jizz nuclei laughing and slowly sliding into the bottle, and then being mixed in it throughout. i snapped back, and acted like i wasn't convinced to do it. she told me it was my choice, and that everyone in the house (parents, grandparents and siblings) had done it and felt better. i rushed to the bathroom to check the bottle because i couldn't believe what she said, and the bottle was nearly empty with the slightly bubbly end left over for me. i froze over the realisation that each of my family member had used my mayonnaise infused sanctified oil on their faces and hair, and i haven't been able to look at any of them in the eye ever since i left the bathroom. 

not sure if i should tell my brother about this now, or keep my mouth completely shut at this point. 

**tl;dr**: came into a bottle of sanctified oil, delayed disposing it off and now my entire family has used the oil on their face and hair

"by pissing my pants, puking on myself, almost killing/losing a $1800 snake, and confessing my undying love to 20 different women on a facebook status (i tagged my girlfriend as well).. happened last night, a good friend of mine drove us to a downtown octoberfest around 5pm, i had about six beers by 7pm and i was definitely feeling drunk. he only had two beers and offered to drive to a liquor bar we frequent, i completely forgot about the age old ""beer before liquor never sicker"" and we went. i remember drinking 2 rum runners at one bar and then leaving to go to another and this is pretty much where i blacked out. i woke up this morning in my bed, still dressed in my button down and slacks, covered in pee and vomit. i took a shower and checked my phone, i had sent a bunch of extremely embarrassing messages to random friends and old girlfriends. i checked my facebook and saw i posted a status confessing my love for 20 different women, and i tagged them. i also confessed that i loved my ex more than i could ever love my current girlfriend and tagged them both. i had a ton of missed calls and a voicemail from my girlfriend telling me she didn't want to see me again. i ate breakfast and sat down contemplating my life when i noticed i did not see me extremely expensive female black eyed leucistic ball python in her cage. i was not sure my stomach could sink any farther but it did, i freaked out. i looked all over my room before finding my python wrapped up in my piss covered bed sheets. my guess is i took her out of her cage before falling asleep.

tldr: drank 6 beers before drinking 4-5 cocktails, woke up in a pool of my own piss and vomit, messaged a bunch of random women and posted on facebook that i loved them, girlfriend broke up with me, almost killed/lost an extremely expensive ball python. ",4
"by taking a bath with my girlfriend. obligatory this happened two months ago

my girlfriend and i were sick and congested.  we were sitting on the couch and she said she was going to take a bath and put in eucalyptus oil and peppermint oil.  

she then asked me if i wanted to join.  sure, laying in a hot bath sounded really nice.  she went downstairs to grab our towels and i started the bath.  as i put the oils in, i yelled asking how much i should put in.  i got the answer of only a little bit. 

apparently our definitions of a little bit are different.  i don't know if you know how strong peppermint oil is, but i should be able to paint a picture.

as we climbed in the hot bath, i realized that my asshole was starting to feel like an ice cube was getting shoved up it.  

in my congested, mentally drained from illness mind, i said ""hey babe, hot water rises right?""

right away she looked back at me and screamed ""how much fucking peppermint oil did you put in?!""

i said i turned it upside down and maybe like 10 drops got out.  

so we jumped out, body covered in water with peppermint.  it burned like icy hot.  my balls were on fire.  my girlfriend starts crying from the pain, and is screaming.  i'm in the fetal position trying to wipe water off my balls. 

i then get the idea of jumping in the shower and seeing if getting the peppermint off of me was possible.  nope.  makes it much worse.

fast forward ten minutes, we are curled up on the couch both covered in multiple blankets trying to get warm.   it wears off on my girlfriend and she says she just feels numb, but it doesn't hurt anymore.  takes me an extra 15 minutes for it to stop hurting.  

the heat from the blankets warmed me, but i felt like i had ice under my skin.  

half an hour later, it went away.

and that's why i'm not allowed to draw our baths anymore.

tl;dr: girlfriend and i are sick.  decide to take bath. i put enough peppermint oil in bath.  my girlfriend and i get it seeping into our pores. has the effect of icy hot.  balls and asshole are in pain.  girlfriend cries, we have to wait out the pain.  

edit:  holy shit, this is in the top ten all time tifu's.  i'm honored and ashamed.  

things that i've learned since i posted this last night

1. a lot about essential oils

2. my girlfriend loves how everyone is reacting to this.

3. too many people have had similar experiences.  

edit #2: thank you whoever game me gold!  i love you.  

edit #3:  my girlfriend is sick and i've had a long day.  all of these comments have us laughing and in a good mood, thank you.  we both needed this.

"by not wearing underwear to work. this definitely happened today, though i wish it hadn't. 

a bit of backstory, this morning the apartments fire alarm went off so we all had to clear out for a bit. in my haste, i skipped putting on underwear. 

i decided to take a nap a while later and when i woke up, i decided to just go to work without remedying the underwear situation. ""it's only a 5 hour shift,"" i thought. it'll be fine. 

i get to work, everything is fine. happy hour starts, we're prepared for the worst. i'm sipping my water in the back briefly and reach down to adjust myself.

imagine my horror when i touch my entire ballsack.  i've never been so alarmed to touch my own balls. my pants, at some point, had ripped clean down the middle and the bois™ were out and about. 

i had to explain that i was having a wardrobe emergency and ran to call my roommate who thankfully showed up with a new pair of pants and underwear. it was a long 45 minutes that i just had to pretend my balls weren't enjoying the draft. 

tl;dr i didn't put on underwear, pants ripped at work and my balls enjoyed some brief freedom. 

edit: if anyone doesn't believe me here's a pic of the old pants, new pants and text receipts(https://m.imgur.com/a/rbdfcv2) 

edit 2: shit i made the front page, not how i expected the day to go given how it started. 

a few peeps kindly pointed out my waist size and y'all are gonna be happy to know w/ the help of antidepressants i've been caring about myself the last few weeks and i've lost 12 pounds by eating better. so yes, that 40x30 you're concerned about won't be a concern forever. :)

edit 3: holy shit 3 silvers and a gold, thank you guys! i never expected this to blow up. thank you for all the words of encouragement and hilarious comments, i stayed up waaay too late last night reading them. 

to answer a common question: i'm very gay, my roommate is not a dude, and we're definitely not fucking. we're just best friends. 

also to the guys who thought i was a girl: i'm sorry you couldn't jerk off to my post.",4
"by smashing some girls teeth as a first impression.. edit: just for a bit of clarity on the situation. i offered to pay as much as i could and she kindly said no it's all good.

i should have been more specific, her two front teeth were both really badly chipped to the point that you could barely see the base of the teeth there.

she's upset about the whole thing but has a very positive outlook on it, i've offered to help cover payments but she has politely declined.



this just happened a couple hours ago. just a bit of context to start out. 

i'm moving into a flat with some great people in a couple of months and they invited me around for a few drinks as it was one of their birthdays. it was a bunch of about 20 of us and it was kind of a who knows who type situation.

it was a great time, everyone was getting along well, quite a few drinks, dancing, the usual stuff. met this girl called jess (not real name) and we got talking and she had the most amazing teeth and smile i've probably ever seen. 

fast forward a couple of hours and we are all heading home, i'm pretty bad with women so classic me i don't make a move and just start walking home. it's about a 20 minute walk across town so nothing too bad but not ideal.

we leave at the same time and we find out we can kind of walk halfway home and split ways there. we're stumbling along with some playful banter and she jokingly tries to trip me up, i'm drunk but not that bad so i manage not to slam the concrete.
in return i jokingly trip her up and here's the tifu. she falls like a 20 metre tall tree straight as a pole and slams the concrete. i feel so bad and instantly picked her up, she has a bloody nose and i'm freaking out because i've just slammed this gorgeous girl into the ground.

she gets up, asks is her face okay and as she says it, i see her two front teeth are both missing. my heart sank. i felt terrible. never felt so bad in my life. i let her know the situation and she bursts out crying. 

i call an ambulance and we got to a&e where we sit for 4 hours waiting to be seen to be eventually told go home and go to the dentist tomorrow. in the 4 hours we did get to know each other relatively well considering the situation. i had a mixture of feeling terrible but also how the fuck does this happen. you only ever hear of these stories

i pay for the taxis home as it's the least i can do and take her in and she invited me in for a tea with her face still fucked up. we chat for a couple hours about random stuff and as i leave i say it'd be cool to hang out sometime and she actually agrees to it once but once her face is in better shape 

tldr: went to drinks, tripped up attractive lady. went to a&e got to know each other really well. now who knows what'll happen",4
"by joining my girlfriend's sister in the shower. long story short, my girlfriend (18) is getting her license next week so i have to pick her up to go to my house and drop her back off at her place (40 min round trip).

last night i dropped her off at midnight and she wanted me to stay since i had work at 6am and my workplace is down the street from her house.

my girlfriend and i regularly shower together at her house. she woke up and told me she was going to take a shower, and left the room, thinking i was going to sleep a little longer. to surprise her, i slyly walked into the bathroom and stripped naked. she was humming in the shower and i thought it'd be funny to scare her, so i opened the shower curtain, penor hanging loose, and yelled ""surprise!!!"" to my shock, it was her sister, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. i stood there for a second trying to process what was going on and just yelled sorry and ran out butt naked.

my girlfriend was in the kitchen and thought it was hilarious when i explained, but her sister and i haven't made eye contact since and haven't said a word to each other. fml.

tl;dr - walked in on my girlfriend's sister naked in the shower thinking it was my girlfriend.

edit: she's 18 as well.

edit 2: a lot of people have posted questions so i'll answer them here. her dad isn't really involved in her life and doesn't care what she does. she's turning 19 next month and her sister recently turned 18. her mom is really chill about us showering and having sex, they even talk about our sex life together which is pretty weird but my girlfriend is really close to her and her mom loves me. her mom is catholic but not very strict about her religious views and doesn't force her religion upon her kids.",4
"by getting frisky with my girlfriend. alt because this embarrassing for her and for me, and she follows my actual reddit account. 

anyways, my girlfriend and i have been dating for a while now, but we moved to opposite sides of the us to attend college. we would have been together for college too but stanford gave me that fat l. this wasn't too big of a deal freshman year since we still had summer and winter break to see each other, but starting last year things got really busy for us. i went with my parents when they flew back to china for a family emergency, and then over the summer, we both had work to do in completely different places. the only time we got to be with each other was over spring break. 

fast forward to our current school year and we again missed the opportunity to hang out over winter break, so by the time i fly out to the bay area to go visit her over spring break, it had literally been an entire year since i've even held hands with her. naturally, being stressed college kiddos with pent-up sexual desire, we sought release as soon as possible. so the morning after i arrived, we have sex. she has always been one to like rough sex, and in particular, she loves getting choked. so of course i oblige her and unwittingly, i leave a bunch of very obvious, very red and angry looking marks on her neck and on her arms from pinning her down. well we just casually cleaned up afterwards and went down to the kitchen in her dorm to make breakfast without really thinking about the marks.

i sat down at a table, and she went into the kitchen to grab a bagel or something, when like six of her housemates also came down to get breakfast. i guess i have a kind of angry disposition immediately after i have sex, since one of her friends asks if i'm doing fine, before heading into the kitchen as well. it's at this point that they also see my girlfriend, who is not with an angry-looking me, and who has red hand marks on both her body and her neck. well they put two and two together and soon, i see them whisk my girlfriend away, while one person comes to angrily ask me about why i was physically assaulting my girlfriend, while threatening to call the police and campus pubsafe. i naturally, have no clue what they're talking about and i can hear my girlfriend being questioned at the same time. the person who was talking to me begins to shout some stuff at me, and it doesn't take long before a few sleepy people start drifting out of their rooms and towards us to investigate. at this point, i'm guessing my girlfriend's friends offered to her to get pubsafe involved as well, because she dashes over to where i was sitting and begins to frantically explain to the small crowd gathered in the kitchen area what exactly had happened. she basically told a good portion of her housemates that she has a thing for rough sex, and that she had merely asked me to choke her while doing to do, much to the embarrassment of everyone listening, and to the two of us. extolling the details of your sex life to the public generally isn't one's proudest moment. afterwards, we both got a few very red-faces apologies, and she quietly ate her bagel.

tl;dr: choked girlfriend too hard during sex, nearly got reported to the police as a domestic abuser and then had to sit and listen as girlfriend told her dorm what our sex is like.",4
"by shocking my girlfriend with my dick.. so this actually happened today.

my girlfriend and i were sitting on the couch, and i had to get up to do something. as i stood up, she turned me around, and went about undoing my pants. i'm thinking to myself 'cool, unexpected sexytime!'

she gets my pants undone, and slides them down. next, she pulls my undies down too, revealing the villain of our story. as she leans forward to kiss my stomach, my dick touches her upper chest, and, like an asshole, delivers a static shock.

my girlfriend recoils a bit, and says something to the effect of ""nope, guess not."" she proceeds to put my dick back where it came from as i stand there, still in disbelief at how thoroughly i was just betrayed by my own manhood. no sexytime for me i guess.

tl;dr: my gf tried to initiate sexytime, and my dick shocked her; she changed her mind.",4
"by falling asleep while tanning next to an attractive girl. there's no obligatory ""this didn't happen today"" because this happened a few hours ago and i'm still mortified.

i'm on holiday with family and on a cruise, we all decided it would be a great idea to go tanning after a long walk around the city we're docked in. we went to the tanning area on the top deck and i split from my family as there wasn't many beds free and i saw a bed open next to this really attractive girl who looks early 20s (same as me) and i think i could have a good shot here so i occupy that bed and make a few bits of chit chat until the tiredness from the walk kicks in and i completely deck out and fall asleep right there. i must've moved around a lot while asleep because i woke up 15 minutes later by a family member telling me to cover myself up as one of my balls was hanging out of my shorts. 

first thing i did was cover up then look to the side to see the girl is no longer there but probably saw just like everyone else who walked past in the 15 minutes. i'm on this ship another week and the embarrassment will live with me forever. help.

tl;dr: fucked up my chances with a girl by my own nutsack that fell out while i was sleeping

edit: saw the girl in the breakfast room and after a while of thinking of what to say i went up and talked to her it went along the lines of ""so i don't know if you was there but i showed off a little more than intended yesterday"" she said she left before that happened to go for dinner but would've found it hilarious so i guess that's a massive win! i said i'll catch up with her later and she sounded happy with that so i guess it wasn't a complete embarrassment! sorry to the many people who did walk past me though hope you enjoyed the view.",4
"by eating a girl out and getting sent to the emergency room.. so this actually happened about 3 weeks ago. 

rewind to a night of heavy drinking, rocking out, and sleeping with a coworker. she was exceptionally fine so i decided to end the foreplay with a little tongue action. everything feels clean, no offensive smell or taste. we move onto the main course and i notice a more than offensive smell, must've dug up something deep. so i finish her and end the night.

a day later and my throat is sore, but i think nothing of it as i was drinking and smoking heavily the night before. 

two days later, my left tonsil is black, green, and white, swollen more than 2x it's size and hurts like a mf. i go down to the local med express to have it looked at and after about 35 mins i see the doctor. with a look of concern on his face, he tells me i need to go to the er. 'the er?' i asked 'is it really that bad?' the doc asks me how long it's been hurting and i told him i had just noticed it today. he tells me it's very aggressive and spreading rapidly; it's beyond his treatment. so i head down to the er to get asked more questions and wait to see another doctor. he finally comes in, looks at it and tells me they're going to have to drain my tonsil with a syringe (which didn't feel the best, by the way).

a script of painkillers, steroids for the swelling, amoxicillin, a few tears later and i'm all better.

tl;dr eating a girl out while she has a bacterial infection might land you in the er for tonsilitis.

edit: 

fun fact: the hospital bill was $606 :)


so it seems a few of you believe my teeth are rotting out of my skull and my mouth is just a festoon of bacteria. well, here's my mouth(https://imgur.com/a/frizu)

"by using the measuring tool app on my dick. i am a fairly new owner of the iphone.  this happened about 45 minutes ago....

i'm in the bath tub (straight man, takes baths), i usually read on my device while laying in the water, but with the new phone i decided to start organizing apps.

as i begin to move apps i'm also trying out some of the new ones i've never seen.  reminders, compass, voice memos, the bullshit extra stuff you can't delete.  

i run across the measuring tool and start testing it out.  how far am i from the door.  how tall is the room.... then i decide to use it on my floating penis log.

as in doing this, of fucking course,  my wife walks into the bathroom.  she never knocks, and i don't expect her to.  i freak out as i have the camera pointed at my dick... and the live view on the screen is on.... so she knows it's photo mode.

she leaves.  i text her and tell her ""it wasn't what you think"".  she laughs and tells me to send her the pictures.  i send her a screen shot of the app, including dick length... so she'll never forget what 11"" looks like.  okay that part was a joke.  but she was a good sport about it.

"by having sex with my wife.. today was about 4 weeks ago. i work in sales and the wife and i went to a big yearly conference at a fancy hotel in a major city a few hours away. it's always a fun conference. lots of free food and booze, with a very nice hotel room. a 4 day all expenses paid getaway with no kids is always fun, and allows for some much needed one on one time as a couple. 

after our main event and dinner on friday (and the 3 hour open bar), my wife and i and some clients went to a local pub and had a few more drinks to cap off the night. the wife and i waked back to the hotel instead of ubering (only about 6 blocks) down the walking path next to a nice waterway that flows through the area of town we were in. beautiful night, drunk, and romantic walk back to the hotel led to some fun time in the room. 

fast forward to yesterday. we have 2 kids, boy (2) and girl (6). we love our kids and our life. about 2 months ago, we finally decided we were done having kids. we had talked about a third for over a year, but decided we had one of each, and the oldest being 6-7 years older than the youngest would be too big of a gap. so, i scheduled a vasectomy for august 1st. i went in thursday and got the snip. easy peasy. now, just 3 days of relaxing with a bag of peas on my man bits. probably binge some shows, game a bit, you know... as i'm sitting on our couch watching lucifer, my wife walks in to the living room with 3 positive pregnancy tests... wtf. apparently the proper precautions weren't taken in our night of drunken love making. 

so... baby #3 it is.

tl;dr i had drunken sex with my wife and didn't use protection or pull. on the day after my vasectomy we find out we're pregnant.

edit 2: we are excited for our 3rd, we both have good jobs, insurance, and a good home. we have no desire to terminate our pregnancy. yes, we had decided to stop trying for a third, but we're ok with a happy accident. thank you for some of your genuine concern. 

edit 3: i think most people understood this, but still. i'm aware we have a 2 year old who is also a sibling. i don't want to edit the post, but i was referring to the gap between our oldest and the new baby being almost 7 years.

"by getting a dna test and revealing a family secret. i've always been interested in doing one of those at-home kits that tell you your ethnicity estimates.  my mother has, for many years, claimed that her own great-grandmother was completely native american, and i recently learned that this is apparently something common for southerners to claim, but that it is rarely true.  i finally went ahead and bought one of the kits because there is nothing i enjoy more in life than proving my mother wrong.  

fast forward a few weeks.  i get my results.  i am 0% native america, which isn't exactly shocking.  the real surprise comes from the fact that i am also 0% eastern european.

this probably wouldn't mean much for most people, but i happen to be polish.  or at least, i thought i was.  i have an unpronounceable, very polish last name.  my great-grandparents were polish-speaking immigrants.  my paternal grandfather himself spoke polish as a child.

my first thought was that the test was a mistake.  my results came over a week before the projected arrival date, and i knew i should be somewhere around 25% polish/eastern european.  so maybe there had been an error somewhere at the lab.  i started digging around through my dna relative matches.  i had matched with an extended cousin with my mom's maiden name, living in the state that she grew up in.  so the dna analyzed was definitely mine, and this was not a switched-tube situation.

there were only two possible explanations:  either my own dad was not my biological father, or my polish grandfather was not the biological father of my dad.  

i look a lot like my father, so it seemed unlikely that we were not related.  however, there was no strong family resemblance between my dad and his own father.  in fact, my grandfather and many of his siblings had a (we'll call it) striking nose that my sister and i had often rejoiced in not inheriting.  also, my paternal grandparents had a disastrous marriage and bitter divorce—an affair did not seem out of the question.

my paternal grandfather died over ten years ago, but my paternal grandmother is still living and i gave her a call.  it took a while for me to fully explain the dna testing to her—she's 87, but we got there.  she denied it and tried to explain the unexpected results with a long ramble about migrating european tribes before i was finally able to make her understand that i would be able to test relatives from the polish side of the family and determine whether or not i was actually related to them.  she told me that she didn't think that was a good idea, and i should think about it before contacting anyone.

i think i knew right then, but it was not until today, two days later, that she finally admitted it to my sister:  my father had been lied to his entire life about his biological father.  

so who is my actual paternal grandfather?  tbd.  my grandmother promised my sister that she will tell the two of everything when my sister gets into town for christmas.  she requested that we not tell anyone until then (it's too late, my sister already told everyone).  

tl;dr:  did an ethnicity test, found out my father was apparently the product of an extra-marital affair and never knew.  

edit to add: i've had a recent string of people asking me for an update.  i posted one a while back, here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7kat5w/tifupdate_and_the_grandfather_is/  ",4
"by hating the person in front of me at the drive-thru. this morning, i woke up on the wrong side of the bed, mainly due to lack of sleep. i decided to go to starbucks for some caffeine to help offset the long day ahead of me, as you do. at a traffic light really close to the drive-thru, i was right behind a large suv sitting in the rightmost lane. i wanted to turn right, and they did not—i couldn't turn, but no biggie. after a long wait, light turns green, and they decide to turn right spontaneously. i was annoyed, but whatever. (no signs say you can't turn right on red.)

they turn into the starbucks drive-thru, blocking me from going and making it so that i'd have to partially block the small road leading into the strip mall or circle around. i had to be somewhere soon, so i took my chances. they didn't pull in all the way, so i stuck out in the small street, annoyed. luckily no one came behind me.

i guess i was in an extra bitchy mood today, but i just started hating this lady and her stupid massive suv and the little chihuahua hanging out her car window and the stupid tv's playing cartoons in the car and the 6 frappucinos they had to hand her. i thought, ""i bet she's one of those super shallow people who lives for the rat race."" i pulled up to the window to get my drink, wanting this clearly shallow-ass lady to leave already.

once i pulled up, they smiled, handed me my drink and said, ""the person in front of you paid for your order already.""

i had never felt so forcefully slapped by the universe before. i could practically hear the words ""shut the fuck up"" ringing in my dumb little brain. immediately my day got 100 times better and easier.

faith in humanity restored, and i hope whoever i was so horrifically judging had a wonderful rest of their day.

tl;dr i spent 10 minutes hating and judging the person in front of me, only to find out that they paid for my drink. made my day, and also changed my life lol

edit: i posted on this sub bc i felt like a total asshole and like i fucked up being a decent person, i also fucked the 'pay it forward' up so yknow

edit #2: apparently people have posted very similar stories (to the point where ppl think i'd just copy it? it's not that good of a story lol) those are coincidental and this did actually happen to me this morning but if you think i'm boring and unoriginal don't upvote, just know you're not actually a detective calling me out on my bullshit

edit #3: sorry for so many edits...consequences to the fuck up were feeling like a complete ass",4
"by finding out my dad is dating a milf i took home from a bar over a year ago and slept with multiple times.. hey reddit,

throwaway because i really don't want this on my main and it getting linked back to me. tl:dr at the bottom.

obligatory the technically happened over a year ago but it hit me today at lunch.

okay so i'll start off by saying my mother and father divorced 5 and a half years ago, my mom has remarried but my dad has been very hit and miss with his luck dating. when he first started dating women i'd always get introduced to them early and then they would disappear off the face of the earth so i asked my dad to not introduce me to anyone until they are serious and have been together for at least 3 or 4 months. 

a bit of back story so y'all can see where this is going. last july to be exact me and some buddies were out at a bar and being young competitive men saw some older ladies out at the bar (mid 40's) and had a bit of a joke around that none of us would be able to take any of them home. well about 10 drinks and a few hours later our little laugh turned into a serious competition. we went over introduced ourselves, had small talk about what they are doing out, were a bit flirty etc and hit them up for a bit of a dance. i got talking to an absolutely fit, stunning dark haired lady who i'll call susan. we were flirting, having a dance and a good time, i got her some drinks and could tell she was having a great time. anyway as the night progressed i thought i'd shoot my shot and see if i could take a milf home, i found out that she had 2 kinds, one who was only a year younger than me. here i am, fulfilling one of my biggest fantasies. so i get a uber for us and she comes back to my apartment. we had really good sex and i got her number the next day after i drove her back to her car. we hooked up 2 more times before i met my current girlfriend.

well a couple of weeks ago my dad calls me and tells me he wants me to meet this woman he has been dating for 5 months. he'd told me a bit about her, including that her name was susan but we live in a pretty big city and i never thought anything of it. somehow of everything he told me nothing registered in my brain. he had said she had 2 kids a similar age to me, and most importantly that they had really hit things off and he really enjoyed her company and wasn't feeling lonely for the first time in years. anyway he asked me to come for lunch today to meet her and was really excited. 

i got to lunch around 15 minutes early and was waiting for my dad and the new lady he's dating to show up, and low and behold i see my dad pull up out the front of the cafe we are having lunch at and see him and the new lady get out of the car. at this point i did the biggest double take of my life, surely it couldn't be...

but it was, my dad, for 4-5 months has been dating the milf i took home from a bar over a year ago. i nearly had a panic attack. as soon as they walked in my dad pointed at the table that i was sitting at and i saw susan's face screw up. she was walking behind my dad and just pulled a face that said ""don't you dare say anything right now"". 

so i sat through the most awkward 45 minute lunch of my life, sweating profusely with my dad asking me if i was alright because i looked sick. i can't even remember what we talked about at lunch because the whole time i realised that me and my dad are tunnel buddies now and i honestly am at a loss for what will even happen next. i want to talk my dad but i can't even imagine the conversation at this stage. i'm hoping susan breaks things off and it doesn't go any further. how the fuck does this even happen, it's like the plot to a bad porn movie!!!

tl:dr - my dad is dating a lady who i have slept with before, she is mid 40's and my dad is early 50's and i can tell he is head over heels for her. just so y'all know i'm 24.

update - so this has blown up and i decided to tell a couple of my buddies to ask what to do. i'll be catching up with dad with some beers to tell him because if the situation was reversed i'd want to know. will update after i've told him.",4
"by showing my friend nude pictures of his sister. this happened almost 4 years ago, but today it made me think about it.

backstory, i met this amazing girl at a party that some friends of mine were throwing.  it was a themed party, prep boy and school girls, and she was as kind as she was sexy.  we exchange numbers and proceed to texting and talking on the phone and went out on a few dates.

well, just like most relationships, i assume, she sent me a few sexy pictures of herself.  well one day, my buddy asks me about the girl i am dating.  i tell him about her and he asks about her body.  i show him a picture she took of herself laying out by the pool, neck down.  he grabs my phone and starts swiping.  before i can stop him he freaks out yelling ""that is my fucking sister!!!"" i then realize the picture he was looking at was one i took of her fully nude.  after that, he was not too happy about it, or me dating his sister.

but this story has a happy ending.  the reason i am posting this today, is because this is the one year anniversary of the day i married that wonderful woman, and that buddy was one of my groomsman.

and before anyone asks, no, she has no clue her brother saw a picture of her nude, i think she would be mortified if she did.

tl;dr: was dating a girl who turned out to be my buddy's sister, showed him a nude photo of her and he freaked out.

edit: since people are freaking out thinking i showed a nude picture on purpose let me clarify.  i showed my friend a picture of her in a bikini neck down that she took laying out by a pool.  she posted said picture on instagram as well as sent it to me.  i did not willingly violate her trust by showing him a nude picture of her.  apologies if my wording was off.

edit 2: thank you for the gold and silver, you guys are awesome!  also, since everyone asks how i didn't know she was my buddy's sister.  she and him have a common last name like smith.  and i did not know his sisters name.  when i told him i was dating a girl named ""jill"" (not her name) he didn't immediately think ""oh hey is that my sister."" because it is a common name.  and as for my wife, we had been dating for a little over a month.  when she said she had a brother, i didn't go ""oh what's his name, where does he work, what's his astrological sign.""  because i wanted to know her first, know her likes and hobbies.  i guess i could have dove more into questions about her family, but we weren't at the point of meeting each other's parents yet.  hope this helps with those questions, if it does not. sorry.  again thank you for all the kind words and happy anniversary comments.  you people are amazing!",4
"by coming into work early to try and impress the boss.. i work at a mid size company with around 30 employees, all the employees start at 7 am with the exception of the owner/boss and myself who prefer to start at 6. i have a project coming to a close and promised to have it ready for next monday. i thought it was a good idea to come in a few hours early so 3:30 to get a head start and impress the boss. i show up right at 3:30. i unlocked the door and went to punch in my alarm code..... i completely forgot my code, i've entered it thousands of times and i just forgot. the alarm started going off and simultaneously the phone rang it was the alarm company calling for my code and i couldn't provide it. they ended up calling the owners home phone and he rushed over to turn off the alarm then of course got in an accident with an un-insured driver, had to pay everything out of pocket..... i also missed the deadline.

tldr; went in early to impress the boss, set off the alarm, he came in to turn it off and got in an accident on the way, wasn't impressed.

edit 1: i say ""mid-size"" as it's mid-size for our industry

edit 2: i don't know all the ins and outs about my bosses insurance and his accident. didn't really feel like pressing him for details, my impression is the damage was less than his deductible.",4
"by trying to shake obama's hand and almost getting taken out by secret service and ruining thousands of peoples day.. as with most tifu, this did not happen today but the memory was spurred by a post i saw on the front page. during the 2008 election, obama came to my university to give a speech. i went through all the usual security screenings and made my way to my seat. i was about 3 rows from the front but on the outside seat of a row right against the entry and exit way for the future president. 

when obama came out, he went straight to the podium to give his speech and do a qanda session. when he finished he made his way down the steps where the crowd rushed to shake his hand. i was probably 4^th or 5^th down the walkway to shake his hand. everybody in front of me was not only shaking his hand but handing him copies of his book to sign. he had a pen in his hand and was signing away. i thought to myself ""damn, i don't have anything for him to sign. hmmm oh wait! yes i do. my ticket i used to get into the event."" there was only 1 issue with the ticket, it was in my jacket pocket...**my inside jacket pocket**. so as the future president is 4 people away, i hastily reach my hand into my jacket pocket to grab my ticket but my hand kinda fumbled around a little before latching onto the ticket. just long enough for the 2 secret service agents standing right in from of me to notice...

they immediately grabbed both my arms, while the one who grabbed my arm that was in the jacket twisted it to pull my hand out of the pocket while preparing to break my arm off if it was any kind of dangerous object. it all happened so fast i couldn't even utter a word, but when they saw all i had was a piece of paper for obama to sign, he let go of my arm, patted me on the shoulder, and mumbled something into his headset. i was just able to get my bearings about me and i was the last person to shake obama's hand at that event.  about that time the security all turned to obama and shuffled him through an open door to the hallway to exit. as obama was being ushered out he said ""sorry guys, they said i have to leave now."" as he was pointing at the secret service around him. so not only did i almost get taken out by secret service, i ruined anybodies day that wanted a chance to meet the man.




tl;dr: tried to shake obama's hand and get an autograph, reached in my jacket and got assaulted by secret service and made obama have to leave which ruined a bunch of peoples day.

"by misunderstanding the ugly duckling. the other night, i was out getting a drink with some friends from university, and for some reason or another, the conversation turned to swans.

now, as a kid, i remember reading the ugly duckling - and for some reason, i completely misunderstood it. not the lesson of the story or anything, but the reason that the duckling was ugly in the first place. the reason being that it was, of course, a swan.

but for some reason, i got a few wires crossed, and thought it was in fact a duckling like the rest. instead of thinking that the swan was a different kind of bird, i thought that swans were just male ducks. for some reason i never stopped thinking it, even though i've seen plenty of ducks, and literally had the differences between male and female ones pointed out to me before. i don't know why it never got through to me. i guess i just thought they were different kinds of duck or something.

what this means is that when one of my friends mentioned something about female swans, i scoffed and very loudly proclaimed that ""you can't have female swans"". i stuck by this, convinced they were fucking with me, until they realised i wasn't kidding.

and that's how i, at the age of 19, finally learned that female swans exist. my friends won't stop laughing at me over it, and i really have no defence other than it made sense at the time.

tl;dr i didn't think swans could be female, my friends won't let me live it down.",4
"my whole life. my regrets as a 46 year old, and advice to others at a crossroad. tifu. more like more whole life really.

hi, i my name's john. i've been lurking for a while, but i've finally made an account to post this. i need to get my life off my chest.  about me. i'm a 46 year old banker and i have been living my whole life the opposite of how i wanted. all my dreams, my passion, gone. in a steady 9-7 job. 6 days a week. for 26 years. i repeatedly chose the safe path for everything, which eventually changed who i was.

today i found out my wife has been cheating on me for the last 10 years. my son feels nothing for me. i realised i missed my father's funeral for nothing. i didn't complete my novel, travelling the world, helping the homeless. all these things i thought i knew to be a certainty about myself when i was in my late teens and early twenties. if my younger self had met me today, i would have punched myself in the face. i'll get to how those dreams were crushed soon.

let's start with a description of me when i was 20. it seemed only yesterday when i was sure i was going to change the world. people loved me, and i loved people. i was innovative, creative, spontaneous, risk-taking and great with people. i had two dreams. the first, was writing a utopic/dystopic book. the second, was travelling the world and helping the poor and homeless.
i had been dating my wife for four years by then. young love. she loved my spontaneity, my energy, my ability to make people laugh and feel loved. i knew my book was going to change the world. i would show the perspective of the 'bad' and the 'twisted', showing my viewers that everybody thinks differently, that people never think what the do is wrong. i was 70 pages through when i was 20. i am still 70 pages in, at 46. by 20, i had backpacking around new zealand and the phillipines. i planned to do all of asia, then europe, then america (i live in australia by the way). to date, i have only been to new zealand and the phillipines.

now, we get to where it all went wrong. my biggest regrets. i was 20. i was the only child. i needed to be stable. i needed to take that graduate job, which would dictate my whole life. to devote my entire life in a 9-7 job. what was i thinking? how could i live, when the job was my life? after coming home, i would eat dinner, prepare my work for the following day, and sleep at 10pm, to wake up at 6am the following day. god, i can't remember the last time i've made love to my wife.

yesterday, my wife admitted to cheating on me for the last 10 years. 10 years. that seems like a long time, but i can't comprehend it. it doesn't even hurt. she says it's because i've changed. i'm not the person i was. what have i been doing in the last 10 years? outside of work, i really can't say anything. not being a proper husband. not being me. who am i? what happened to me? i didn't even ask for a divorce, or yell at her, or cry. i felt nothing. now i can feel a tear as i write this. but not because my wife has been cheating on me, but because i am now realising i have been dying inside. what happened to that fun-loving, risk-taking, energetic person that was me, hungering to change the world? i remember being asked on a date by the most popular girl in the school, but declining her for my now-wife. god, i was really popular with the girls in high school. in university/college too. but i stayed loyal. i didn't explore. i studied everyday. 

remember all that backpacking and book-writing i told you about? that was all in the first few years of college. i worked part-time and splurged all that i had earned. now, i save every penny. i don't remember a time i spend anything on anything fun. on anything for myself. what do i even want now?

my father passed ten years ago. i remember getting calls from mom, telling me he was getting sicker and sicker. i was getting busier and busier, on the verge of a big promotion. i kept putting my visit off, hoping in my mind he would hold on. he died, and i got my promotion. i haven't seen him in 15 years. when he died, i told myself it didn't matter what i didn't see him. being an atheist, i rationalized that being dead, it wouldn't matter anyway. what was i thinking? rationalizing everything, making excuses to put things off. excuses. procrastination. it all leads to one thing, nothing. i rationalized that financial security was the most important thing. i now know, that it definitely is not.
i regret doing nothing with my energy, when i had it. my passions. my youth. i regret letting my job take over my life. i regret being an awful husband, a money-making machine. i regret not finishing my novel, not travelling the world. not being emotionally there for my son. being a damn emotionless wallet.

if you're reading this, and you have a whole life ahead of you, please. don't procrastinate. don't leave your dreams for later. relish in your energy, your passions. don't stay on the internet with all your spare time (unless your passion needs it). please, do something with your life while your young. do not settle down at 20. do not forget your friends, your family. yourself. do not waste your life. your ambitions. like i did mine. do not be like me.

sorry for the long post, just had to get it out there.

tl:dr i realised i let procrastination and money stop me from pursuing my passions when i was younger, and now i am dead inside, old and tired.





edit: i am quite overwhelmed at the response, thank you for your time. i had posted on a whim, and did not expect the reception.

in regards to my post, i must admit i was quite emotional at the time. as i read what i had written earlier, i can't stop myself from noticing an abundance of spelling and grammatical mistakes, phrases that i would not usually say. i don't think i have used capital locks so much in my life. 
however i will not edit them. that would not do it justice.

i have read many of the replies and will try my best to answer the reoccurring questions. i will add that the replies have given me a new perspective of life, reddit and humanity in general. the amount of encouragement and humour persists to amaze me. despite my situation, i even found myself laughing at a few of the comments.

what my plans are.
i am planning to cut down my hours substantially. i will take a new job if i have to, as i am relatively well-off. i am going to talk to my wife. divorce is currently not what i have in mind and i hope that our communication and relationship will improve. if it doesn't, then so be it. we will both move on. i see there are quite a number of negative comments about her, however i am going to have to say in her defence, she really is a lovely person. she is smart, empathetic and has a great sense of humour. i'm not saying it was okay for her to do what she did, but she's not an evil person. i know that. we were both in the fault. we let communication dwindle, and with it, our relationship. there is so much more to being a head of house than just being able to bring in the money. a steady balance of emotional connection, love and finance is what i will strive to give.

my son. i don't any anything about him. i really don't. i have unknowingly distanced myself from him; i only see him around dinner time. i do not recall having a proper conversation with him, it's quite preposterous now that i think about it. i'm not exactly sure how i'll start bonding with him, i have become quite a boring person. however, i plan to change that. i refuse to be a poor role model. i will ensure that he does not make the same mistake i did with my family. i have decided i am going to start watching his basketball games and rugby games on saturdays. i never have, due to work, but i will ensure that i do. perhaps i will even play video games with him. there was a time i had a collection of snes games, and i wasn't half bad either. who knows, i might really connect with my son, and it seems to be something he enjoys.

in regards to the novel and travelling, i admit, i am a different person from my youth. i no longer have the creativity and desire to complete the novel. when i found the long-forgotten 70 pages, the writing was no longer mine. i have changed substantially in 26 years. i am sorry to disappoint as so many of you seemed incredibly keen to read it. however, i am just as excited to read the stories of all of you aspiring writers that have expressed their passion!
the travelling, i might still do. family trips probably, in the school holidays. maybe with my wife every now and then, if she'd have me. 

i can't turn back time and see my father for a final time, though my mother is still alive. she lives in london, so visits are quite difficult. however, i will make an effort to see her. i do love my parents. i only wish i had not prioritised them as i did.

in regards to the advice i have given. i stand by what i said. live your life. do not procrastinate and let lethargy stop you. however, i might add, avoid living in poverty. i have had the good fortune to have had never experienced hunger or homelessness. i would imagine chasing your ambitions and being happy would be considerable more difficult without proper nutrition and living standards! i believe someone mentioned their dream was financial stability. i say, that is just as valiant as any dream to have. we are all different and are missing different things in our lives, be honest with yourself and you'll know what you really want.
i believe there were arguments upon my language and university/college or what not. i will clarify that, although australians generally call tertiary education 'university' here, i have made small efforts to pertain to americans, as they are the main users, at least i assume. and yes, university/college was free when i attended. i believe australians now are able to attend them relatively free (upfront) and can pay their fees after they graduate.

i believe i have covered the general scope of questions. 

p.s. thank you for the gold, i do appreciate it, but they aren't of real value to me. perhaps if reddit ever includes a re-gifting gold feature, i will gift them to some of the commenters. and yes, please stop sending me gold! i also believe someone tried to even donate to me? i assure you, money is not what i read. please save it for yourself!

i don't think i'll come back to reddit, unless i hear about a way to re-gift gold. i thank you all for your sympathy, your time, and i wish all the best for those in difficult situations. i have faith in your capacity and ability to change, to become happy, to help yourselves. because after all, you're the person in the best position to.
and no, i am not considering religion, i just do not have the correct mindset. i am logical to the point that i cannot, however that is not to say religion isn't bad, it gives people the hope and sense after death which i really do envy.

sincerest of regards,

john.

"tifu. i, a hijabi told my teacher to burn the bible. before you go all pork on me, i'll give you some insight. in islam you discard anything with god's name on it by burning it. yesterday in statistics, our teacher found a bible that was left in our class. no one knew who it belonged to and our teacher said, ""you can't throw it in the trash right?, there's a thing against that.?"" and i, the only hijabi in my grade said ""i think you're supposed to burn it"" the whole class turned and looked at me like i wanted to kill them. i just checked and one of the proper methods of disposing a bible is by cremating it so i was right. i posted it in r/izlam, and someone commented ""yeah, in germany we have bad memories about burning books, but we were mostly nazis back then burning anything that is against fascist doctrine"" maybe the reactions were because i live in a primarily jewish town, or because christians are unaware of how holy scriptures are to be recycled.
tl;dr: my teacher asked how you dispose of a bible and i said to burn it because that's the proper method but looked savage

"by trying to be my boyfriends hero. sorry in advance for mobile formatting.

so this happened yesterday night, here is some context.

i am a serial sprainer, in the 4 years my boyfriend has lived with me, i have sprained my ankle 7 times. i have tripped random stupid crap, dog toys, a rock in the grass, stairs, anything my ankles can find they will try to kill me on.

my boyfriend is always there, coddling me and nurturing my softball heels. i always thought one day i will be there to nurture his aches when he would fall.. but he never fell.

in the four years we have lived together he has never once slipped on ice, tripped on a rock, tumbled over an ottoman, or even dragged his foot across some slippery water.

that was until yesterday.

we were uber eats delivering in the lazy snowfall we had in kansas, thinking we might get some decent tips. we delivered to this townhome complex, he got out to deliver while i stayed in. on his way back to the car his phone chimed for another delivery. he pulled out his phone, and instead of paying attention down he went on a patch of ice.

he didn't fall and crack, he fell down with enough grace to land on his butt and his elbow. still, beggars can't be choosers. 

it was my turn.

i was going to coddle him now. i was going to nurture his swollen softball bumps. i was going to pick him up and help him to the car and baby him while he sniffled and reeled.

i was going to be the hero for once.. keyword being ""was.""

i lept out of the car. ""i can be your hero baby"" played in my head like elevator music. i felt my cape flowing figuratively behind my back.

suddenly i was on the ground, my knee twisted at an 80 degree angle. my hip felt the twist and it hurt so bad, i thought i broke it. unlike him, i did not fall gracefully. i hit the ground with such a thud that the lady in the car next to us got out ready to help me.

i laid there on the ground, air knocked out of me. enrique iglesias' ""hero"" stopped abruptly and instead sirens were blaring in my head. i instinctively wriggled my feet to see which one was going to get too thicc for socks.

everything seemed fine until i went to get up. nope. my knee was kaput, and i let out a gasp in surprise.

of course my boyfriend was up, not even bruised or limping, ready to swipe me up and buckle me into the car.

my boyfriend and this sweet lady was trying to help me up, but i elected to chubby lady crawl by the car so i could get up myself. i had them open the door and i crawled in, thanking the lady and buckling myself in.

as i sniffled and licked my wounds, he told me he was grateful that my first reaction was to try to help him. we laughed and joked about how funny it was. it was like a cartoon skit, i was peter griffin falling down and holding my knee, hissing between my teeth. one moment i was coming around the car the next i was on the ground with a shocked look on my face. i am still giggling about it.

he went to the store to get us some treats since we didn't want to end the night on a bad note, and once he disappeared into the store i just bawled and screamed. i think if anyone heard me they would think i was possessed.

i just wanted to be there for him for once, i felt so useless that even when he fell i couldn't help him. instead once again i was the victim of a sprain, only i wish it was my ankle. this time it is my knee, and i would rather sprain my ankle twice again. 

i composed myself by the time he got back to the car with skittles.

today i am confined to the bed, wishing we had our uber card already so we could get some crutches and gooey pizza. now i am browsing reddit until my phone dies then napping while it charges.

he on the other hand, doesn't even have a bruise to show for it.

boyfriend: 8
me: 0

tl;dr: i fall down a lot, my boyfriend never falls. he finally fell for the first time in 4 years, and when i went to help him. i fell down too and ended up spraining my knee.

super edit: thanked people for gold and platinum, was unintentional super cringe, so.. yeah. glad ya'll got a laugh tho.",4
"tifupdate by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital. hey everyone. this happened a few weeks ago but i haven't had time and just wanted to make sure everything had settled down before updating.

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvg72z/tifu_by_thinking_my_daughter_was_being_raped_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

in the original post i left out some details that caused a lot of confusion so i will clear those up now. when i went into the room i grabbed his shoulders and started screaming at him. he stood up and i pushed him down. i went over to my daughter to make sure she was okay and she was screaming that it was a fetish. her bf was unconscious and we sat there trying to wake him up. he woke up and was conscious but was shocked/confused. he was wearing his jeans with his wiener out while they were having sex and was also shirtless, so i wrapped a blanket around him to cover his genitals and upper body and helped him into the car. in the car he zipped himself up and i gave him my sweater to wear. i realize now how my original post might sound like i was driving him around unconscious but i would have called the ambulance and not tried driving him myself as this would've been life or death so i'm sorry this was misleading. hell, i probably wouldn't have been able to carry him to the car (i'm just a strong but average sized lady :p) anyways, since he was conscious at the hospital they just had a nurse check up on him but he had to wait to see a doctor so he was in the er for a while. 

the doctor did some scans and found that her bf (thankfully) didn't have any injuries. he said that most likely her bf fainted since he didn't hit anything on the way down and woke up shortly after. her bf has also fainted before (long story) so thankfully he was unconscious due to the fainting and not the actual knockout. 

after the doctor determined he didn't have any injuries i called his parents to tell them, and they decided they didn't need to make the long trip. my daughter's bf begged me not to tell them the specifics of what had happened so we kept it at that.

for my daughter, we had a conversation about her kink. she says she has a safe word and has never had to use it and her bf always takes care of her after sex to make sure she is okay and loved. i told her that i didn't want her to be afraid to have sex at home because it's a safe place and i don't want her to feel bad over this. i installed a lock on her door as a little ""i'm sorry"" gift. i think this is something i should have done a while ago to give her some privacy, and i'm glad i've got that covered now. i also vowed to never have any surprise visits again. 

for her bf i got him a card, some chocolate, and i paid for him to have a night at an airbnb with her so they could have a private night together. 

tldr; everything worked out in the end. boyfriend wasn't hurt, and daughter has a lock on her door now.",4
"by unzipping my balls. not sure if this disqualified me but it actually happened a few minutes ago. just before my shower i decided to do a bit of manscaping on the ol' vagina miner. grabbed the dedicated clippers and went to town knocking back some of that kentucky fescue when i spotted one slightly angry looking follicle. positionally, we're talking less on alvin and moreso on the chipmunks. as any sane person would do, i grabbed some tweezers with the intention of yanking the little shit out (the hair not the dick). i squeezed the hair with my tweezers, and being the baby i am, gave it a fast tug. and because the universe is a cold-hearted bitch, it turned out that this hair wasn't your standard ingrown. nah. this greedy fiber decided it wasn't enough to coil up in a small ball and just uncoil like your grandmother's knitting yarn. instead, it chose to grow at a near 90° to my taco bender so when i gave it that sweet tug of justice it split open my hog like fedex shipping envelope. and so here i stand with one hand clutching toilet paper against my angry inch while the other types this out to you fine dimes. hope you have a great saturday and can manage to keep your favorite penis in better shape than i have. 

tl;dr - yanked an ingrown hair that happened to be growing sideways and sliced open my testicles like a bag of off-brand cereal.

"by diving into a pool headfirst, degloving my skull, and breaking my neck in 3 places.. update: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cfbo0i/tifu_by_diving_into_a_pool_headfirst_degloving_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 

as per usual this didn't happen today but this past saturday. i (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. one of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. so we hop out and me, being the genius that i am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. i go to take a running leap in and as i'm pushing off the deck, i feel my foot slip. i end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. i come to as i'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause i need to breath, but they don't respond. most of my friends see me and think i'm joking, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. they stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. in another incredible bout of luck, once i'm stabilized on the deck i can move my legs again. friends call an ambulance (to which i am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks us healthcare prices) and once i get to the hospital i'm placed in the trauma icu and ct scanned. i then find out i've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. and now i get bed rest and at least 3 months in a c collar. so yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks! 

tldr: dove in the shallow end, wrecked my neck like a hydraulic press

"by handing my usb to my roommate. **gonna use a throwaway. i'm not giving my roommate the satisfaction of sharing this stupid shit of his on my actual account.** 

i had an essay to print out this weekend but since i no longer had my own printer, rest her poor soul, it meant driving down to the print shop. so, i wasted no time copying all my shit to a usb and grabbing my coat. i was literally just about to shut the door behind me when i heard my roommate calling my damn name. he wanted something printed out as well. a fucking flyer or some shit. random, but ok whatever. 

he asked if he could use my usb. i didn't see why not, so i said sure. once he was done copying the file from his laptop, he gave me back my usb and said: ""valar morgulis, motherfucker"". i said: ""valar dohearis, you degenerate turd"" and bounced. the print shop was busy when i got there but the wait was worth it because the girl who came to assist me was cute as fuck. little did i know, this would only be the beginning of my humiliating downfall.

i handed the cute print shop girl my usb with the simple instruction of printing out the two files on there. as far as i knew, there was nothing else on the usb except those two documents. print shop girl stared at her computer screen before locking eyes again. her expression was unreadable. like she was trying hard not to show an emotion. she leaned in and sheepishly asked: ""which two files, sir?"". i replied: ""only the two you see on there"". 

at that moment she turned the computer screen towards me and revealed that there was close to a dozen folders on there. folders that never even existed when i copied my essay. here's the damn punchline. all these fucking folders were labeled with hardcore, homo-erotic descriptions:

**""tiny twink drilled hard by handsome handyman""**

**""college stud drains his big uncut cock""** 

**""cute boy fucked in the ass by daddy""**

**""teasing my drunk straight friend with raw dick""**

**""high school hunks fuck bareback""** 

**""hung doctor gets head after physical""**

**""planet of the bottoms: dawn of da dick""** 

there were loads more, but i'm sure ya'll get the pornographic picture. i shook my head in horror and said: ""that ain't mine"". print shop girl's eyes narrowed and practically penetrated my fucking soul. 

""what should i print for you, sir?"" 

""it's my roommate... he does this kinda shit""

""of course""

*crickets*

i swallowed what remained of my dignity and did what had to be done. 

""print the one called assignment, please. under, uh... all ass all access. thank you""

**tl:dr i walked into my local print shop with an essay i had to print out. walked out looking like a porn addict.**

&nbsp;

*edit: ya'll giving me too much attention. appreciate the rewards though. just wanna provide feedback to some of the comments. i requested that print shop girl expand the display settings to show the number of files in each folder. all the folders had 0 files except one: ""all ass all access"". that's how i located my essay. for the record, i'm not gonna revenge-prank my damn roommate by fucking him. also, this throwaway isn't to hide this post from him, i just don't wanna have him think these little stunts of his are worthy of living on the reddit account i use daily. hence, an account that will eventually become obsolete. valar morghulis, ya'll.*",4
"by ruining my valentine's date with my girlfriend. so my girl and i had a great night planned. i made reservations at her favorite restaurant. she got a sexy little number to wear for ""after dinner"" and sent me teasing texts all day. she absolutely loved the flowers i got her, and she presented me with a bouquet of homemade beef jerky. she then proceeded to spend, i kid you not, 3 hours getting ready.  she looked friggin' amazing though. we were both starving and she was really looking forward to a night out. 

so we get to the restaurant and get seated. the only menu they give us is this valentine's day special. i do some quick mental math and realize *this dinner is going to cost me close to $300.* 

oh. hell. no. 

so my gf looks up from the wine list and sees i am antsy. she asks what's wrong. i mumble something about their prices having gone up. she asked if i wanted to go somewhere else and i jumped on it. practically raced out of there. she followed along and sheepishly made excuses to the wait staff. 

so we get back to the car and i apologized and told her $300 was ridiculous for one dinner and she was like ""wait? what? it wasn't that much"" 

turns out the menu prices were *per couple* not per person like i had thought. 

once i realized that dinner would in fact have been in my budget. i tried to get her to go back to the restaurant. this is where i *really* fucked up. she kept saying no and that she didn't want to. she said she would be too embarassed to go back. i said that was ridiculous and i didn't understand why and i kept trying to get her to go back. then she suddenly burst into tears and sobs ""why. aren't. you. listening? it doesn't matter why all that matters is that it does. why do you want to push me into something that makes me feel so uncomfortable?""

ah fuck. she kinda had a point. i apologize and drive her home. i asked if she wanted to go to any of the other restaurants on our route home. she said no since she ""looked like shit"" since her make up got all messed up from crying. (she didn't. she still looked gorgeous) 

we get home and i don't think anyone on the face of the planet has ever gotten changed from fancy clothes to sweats as fast as she did. i tried apologizing again, she said it was ok but she just wanted to be alone for a while. 

now she and the cat are in the other room watching true crime documentaries. 

tl;dr i ruined date night by thinking the restaurant was over priced and leaving (it wasn't) then not listening to her. now girlfriend and cat are probably plotting how to get away with my murder.

edit: just to clear up some confusion from the way i worded it. dinner was not $150 per person. they were doing a v day special where for $150 you got dinner, dessert, champagne and flowers for 2. 

edit 2: wow! i can't believe how this blew up! thanks everyone! of course my first reddit gold is on a throw away. lol but thank you! 
also... fuck. girlfriend has indeed found this post. i got a ""did you post about last night on reddit?"" text from her this morning.

"by telling my coworkers i like kiddie porn.. this happened a few hours ago but i need to back up to last night to give a proper explanation.   

i've started watching chernobyl on hbo since got is over. i'm digging it so far and watched episode 3 last night. there's a scene where a group of 100 guys are digging tunnels under the nuclear reactor and it's hot. they can't use fans due to dust and blah blah blah so these men strip completely naked while they work. my immature ass thinks this is hilarious! i saw more junk in that 30 second scene than i've seen in 10 years. i'm giggling like a middle schooler pointing at all the penises. my boyfriend didn't find it as funny, but that's another story. the episode ends, all is well and i go to bed.  

then, this morning is when the fuck up happens. i'm chatting with some coworkers during break and someone asks me how my night was. my poor attempt at being funny was to respond with, ""it was pretty awesome, i saw a bunch of naked miners."" everybody kind of froze and just stared at me....i didn't clue in for the longest time. i just stared blankly back at them. nobody laughed at all and i could feel my anxiety closing my throat when it dawned on me. they thought i said naked minors! 

the english language is fucked up sometimes!   i quickly explained what i was actually talking about. everybody got a great kick out of it but i'm still the office creep now.  

tl:dr i said i saw a bunch of naked miners, but everyone thought i said naked minors.",4
"by allowing my husband to come to dinner at my boss' house. this actually took place a couple of years ago.

i had just gotten a brand new job that i was really excited about. so i was delighted when my boss - who i had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. 

well, mostly delighted. my husband is..... well... he's the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. because of this, i was worried about him coming along. 

by the time the day of the dinner arrived, i had become so anxious about it that i actually floated the idea by my boss that i wasn't sure if he would be able to make it. she was clearly taken aback and responded ""oh no! i really hope he can, i have a dinner for 3 all ready to go."" upon seeing her dismay, i assured her that i was sure he would find a way to be there. 

well, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. it was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.

i had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. 

my boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when i noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. it was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you're not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.

i look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. before i had a chance to fully comprehend what i was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. it hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. 

now my husband does dumb shit, i already told you that. but he's not a crazy person. usually when he does dumb shit i at least understand what he's thinking. there' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.

in this case i was just dumbfounded. i couldn't believe my eyes. i couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. i stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. 

i couldn't make any sense of what was happening, but i also didn't have time to try. i heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.

it suddenly sunk in that it didn't matter *why* he did what he did. he did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. 

i could feel the anger flush through my face. for a brief moment i contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. but no. this was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. not like there was any possible recovery anyway.

my boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill there's the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. my boss and i are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.

he finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. i leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. 

he makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.

we all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn't there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.

as soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.

turns out the dumbass didn't like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. my husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. he thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. 

a year or so later my boss hosted a christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. my best friend, jennie, was my +1.

tl;dr: took my husband to dinner at my boss' house. he thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.

**note:** my husband told this from his perspective a couple years ago(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. someone suggested i should tell it from my perspective. hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)

**edit:** ok guys, i probably overplayed the ""dumb shit"" angle. yeah, he's known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  from my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. my husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. 

**edit 2:** no my husband is not on the spectrum or crazy, although i get that that may seem like a valid conclusion if all you know is this one event. the usual dumb shit is more of your everyday impulsiveness, like immediately saying the slightly inappropriate thing that comes to mind. if he would've done that, it wouldn't have shocked me at all. this, of course, shocked me, because he *normally doesn't do things that make him look insane*.  not sure why some seem to be taking the ""he often does dumb shit"" to mean ""he often does completely insane things"", when i feel like i was making the exact opposite point. oh well. glad that most of you got some small bit of enjoyment out of your day from the story.  also, we all have our faults. i joke about my husband not thinking things through, he jokes about my preoccupation with what others think of me, etc, etc.",4
"by getting my tonsils removed. i like many people in adulthood have had to deal with the annoyance of overgrown tonsils. from the 3 – 4 times a year tonsillitis, to the sleep apnoea that they cause. personally, i wanted my tonsils gone.

after getting tonsillitis for the second time this year i decided enough is enough, i booked an appointment with my gp, referred to the surgeon and made a date for the surgery.

i was warned that i was in for the sorest through of my life and that it was going to be agony for a while. which was ok, how bad could it be?

day 1: i was prepped and ready to go, surprisingly not too nervous for my first major surgery. the procedure went well, my tonsils were gone and i was all set to recover in hospital. the pain wasn't too high yet, i was still spaced out from the drugs, so all in all the first night was quite easy.

day 2:

4am: i woke up needing to go to the bathroom, i felt like i needed to spit so i rushed over to the bathroom sink. i spat out a few mouthfuls of blood not thinking too much of it. i slowly shuffled back to my bed and quickly fell back asleep.

7:30am: this time i awoke to a lot of pain, i buzzed the nurse to get my dose of endone and panadol. i mentioned to her that i had bled a little overnight. she was immediately concerned, she passed me a plastic cup and told me to spit all the blood that comes up from now.

(i thought that leaking blood would be common as it was when i got my wisdom teeth out.)

for the next few hours slowly but surely i was filling up this cup that looked more and more like red wine. it was horrible because the pain was quite high regardless of the pain killers, i couldn't lie down an rest as the blood would go in to my stomach.

10pm: the nurses tried to use an ice pack on my neck and give me countless icy poles to freeze the blood but nothing was working, i had filled almost two cups now and they decided it was time to call my surgeon.
they broke the bad news to me and told me i needed to be prepped for surgery again. i was surprisingly ok with it. i remained calm and collected. i went through the procedure again of getting countless needles and being sedated. (fun!)

post second surgery: i was back where i was today but hopefully no more bleeding! the surgeon informed me that a blood vessel had haemorrhaged around my tonsil area causing blood to leak. i had to have blood sucked out of my stomach because i had indeed swallowed quite a bit of blood.

he told me that this complication only happens once a year for him! (lucky me.)

day 3-4:

the recovery was brutal and painful, i was in bed all day, struggling to get any solids down as the pain was too bad to swallow. however, no complications.

day 5:
for anyone who has had the pleasure of having a tonsillectomy you would know the most painful part about it is waking up from a snooze.

i learnt that the best thing to do is get up, drink some water and have some meds asap!

i was getting out of the shower when i felt a large amount of liquid in my mouth, i leaned over the sink and spat out blood.

here is a picture of the sink: https://m.imgur.com/kpxtomf

my mum, who had been amazing throughout this whole thing, was luckily around the corner from my home when this happened. so i called her and we decided the safest bet would be returning to hospital.

i felt very unwell in the car ride, and i was pale as a ghost. they quickly put an iv in and gave me fluids.

after a very long wait we were advised by my surgeon to return home and come back in if it were to happen again.

i returned home and rested up for a few hours, it was around 9pm when i felt the same liquid taste in the back of my throat. this time i knew. i rushed to the bathroom and proceeded to cough up blood.

here's a photo of this time: http://imgur.com/s2yfx39

as you can see, it's a lot more this time around.

i don't know if you have ever had the displeasure of coughing up blood but the worst part about it is just how sticky blood is. it sticks to your tongue, throat and lips, resulting in blood clots getting stuck in your mouth. it's horrible.

i called my mum and she rushed over to come get me.

back to hospital again and another iv :)

i was admitted back to the ward and i stayed overnight, my night wasn't overly dramatic. i bled once around 3-4am but it only lasted 5 minutes so there wasn't much for concern.

day 6!!!!

things were looking ok, i was still in a lot of pain but i had not bled outside of the little one in the morning.

1pm: i was watching shitty daytime tv as i reached to have a sip of water, i felt that same feeling in my throat come on and it felt heavy quick.

i had no time to react so i grabbed the smoothie cup i had received from my mum and proceeded to spit mouthfuls of blood in to it. i was trying to get a hold of my buzzer to notify the nurse.

they came in shortly after and rushed to get me a vomit bag, it was coming fast. the nurses were trying to keep me calm and they again put an ice pack behind my neck to try and slow down the bleeding. i kept coughing it up. i started making gagging noises as the blood was sticking and clotting around my throat.

i started to feel light headed. within seconds of saying that, i fainted.

i woke up seconds later to the ward now being in code blue, i had never seen so many nurses and doctors in one room so fast. there must have been 15-20 people in this small room. i had needles going in to my arms, an oxygen mask being put on, and multiple nurses and doctors talking to me.

""raph, stay with us.""

""raph, look at me, keep your eyes open.""

this was the first time in my life that i was genuinely scared for my life.

i could overhear that they were trying to get a hold of my surgeon, because once again i needed emergency surgery.

i was rushed into theatre and they prepped me again. giving me another iv there was a delay because my surgeon was finishing up surgery for another patient at another hospital.

it was at this moment where i broke down crying. i felt so sick, all i could taste was blood, i was scared, alone. i didn't know what was going to happen to me. all the while i was still coughing up a lot of blood.

after some time had passed, the nurse with me was starting to panic.

""we need to get him into theatre now!""

they kept trying to give me oxygen but i kept coughing blood into the mask.

my surgeon arrived and i was put to sleep.

i woke up in unbearable pain and agony, it was the worst pain i had felt since this whole thing began. but that quickly changed when i was given morphine.

i rested up and was eventually moved back into the ward and i was greeted by my mum and nan. my poor mother had been through hell. she had only just before it all went down. she was bawling her eyes out the whole time i was going through it all, blaming herself for leaving :(

day 7:

i got a big sleep and i woke up to my surgeon checking in on me. he was truly sorry for my ordeal, and said i was the worst he had ever seen.

the cause was the same as last time, a vessel had opened up and caused the bleeding.

all in all i lost 800ml of blood from that ordeal. that's almost a fifth of total blood!

it's crazy to think that if i wasn't in the ward when it happened there was a good chance i could have died.

day 8-9:

i stayed in hospital. everyone agreed that it was the best place for me, just in case thunder struck three times.

i was pretty shook on day 8 still, but as soon as word got out that it went from standard procedure to almost fatal i was receiving a lot of love from my family and friends.

twitch kept me sane throughout my stay. all my streaming buddies reached out and wished me well which all contributed to making me feel better.

day 10:

i am typing to you all from my phone! this is probably the longest thread i have ever written on reddit and i don't normally post much but i wanted to share my story because this will stick with me for the rest of my life.

each day i'm feeling more and more strong. my pain still sucks but it's getting less severe and i haven't bled since! i'm out of hospital being taken very well taken care of by my mother.

as cliche as it sounds, this whole experience made me very grateful not only for my life, but more importantly the doctors, nurses, surgeons, paramedics etc. that go through so much stress to help us fellow humans live the lives we live.

i can't wait to be back in full health and hopefully i can play some games and get some streams in before i go back to work! ;)

tl;dr: i got the procedure of getting my tonsils out. unfortunately due to complications i needed multiple emergency surgeries. after a few days of rest from the second procedure, i started to bleed excessively. which quickly made me faint turning the hospital into a code red state. i lost a significant amount of blood and i was prepped for a third and final procedure that saved my life.

edit: a small amount of you requested my twitch, here it is: twitch.tv/wristyplum :)

thankyou so much for all the kind words. i really did not expect this to blow up as it has. y'all are so nice!

edit 2: you guys have asked for an update so here it is:

i'm feeling so much better, the pain is no where near as bad! today was the first day i woke up and didn't straight away need painkillers, i'm able to eat whole meals with a side of water to help wash it down. 

my happiness is so high due to the fact that i'm feeling more and more like me again not this zonked out zombie!

i still can't believe how many people this post has affected. my intentions were never for it to go ""viral"" i just wanted to tell my story mostly for me, when it was still fresh in my mind. i could express myself and always look back on this moment in life, but now because of everyone's support and love i'll look back on it in ways i could never imagined!",4
"by reading my brother's journal. this did actually happen today, as the clock had just barely struck midnight and christmas was upon us. also, this is my throwaway because dammit, i'll not have this following me to my actual account.

i was in the laundry room which doubles as the storage room, where belongings go to die. i saw a book that did not immediately appear to be a journal on one of the shelves, so i grabbed it and flipped it open to the middle. i recognized my younger brother's handwriting and knew i had wandered onto private property, but my eyes lingered a little too long on the page. 

my brother has been out of the house for several years. he deployed to afghanistan and got married when he returned to the states. he's always been a little weird but we (mostly) accept his quirks as just social anxiety and move on. but there i was, in the asscrack of christmas morning holding a journal that he obviously had written during his teenage years. it was one of those journals that ask you questions and you fill in the answers, and of course the question i opened to was ""what's something you hope no one ever finds out about you?""

there, staring at me from the page was the following sentence: ""that i had sex with one of the cows.""

yes, we grew up on a farm. i don't believe he was speaking merely of a corpulent maiden. 

i consider myself open minded, and have prepared myself for various scenarios with my siblings. what if they come out as gay or trans, what if they become addicts, what if they end up in prison, what if they were to join the circus. i have never entertained the possibility of ""what if they romanced the livestock."" life just doesn't prepare you for random bestiality. 

tl;dr i found out my brother dabbled in bovine sexual escapades and now i live in a world where i just have to know that and pretend i don't.",4
"by destroying my brother's smart home. this actually happened a week ago but i just found out about it today.

my brother rents a studio in nyc but he's been out of town for work. i went up to visit some friends and he said it'd be fine if i stayed at his place. when i got there the wall lights worked but for some reason none of the floor lamps did. there were 5 different floor lamps and none of them would turn on. there was also recently a power outage that affected the same area his studio is in so being the bright man that i am i figured that the power coming back must have fried the bulbs. being a good brother i went out and bought brand new bulbs and threw out the broken ones. 

today my brother got back and gave me a call asking if i replaced his light bulbs. i told him i did and not to worry about it but his old ones were broken so i replaced them. turns out they weren't broken, they were just smart bulbs linked to his smart speaker. they were $60 a piece so i effectively threw out $300 of smart bulbs.

&#x200b;

tl;dr brightest bulb in the closet threw out hundreds of dollars in smart bulbs",4
"by encouraging my husband in bed and ruining sex for the day nsfw. so as usual, this wasn't today but last weekend.
after a busy workweek where me and my husband had been coming home, and pretty much passing out at the end of the day, we figured a saturday afternoon would be the perfect time for some quality alone time.
i'd been teasing him for the morning whilst we did general household chores and finally dragged him upstairs mid afternoon to get down to business! 

everything started off brilliantly, the clothes got thrown, things got hot and quickly led into some excellent 69ing.
now, my husband is deft of finger and pretty quickly had me moaning with pleasure and a very intense orgasm. 
we quickly switched to him on top and i was encouraging him to go harder so that he could have a great finish as well. still all good so far! i continued to egg him on, telling him to step up his game and finish him. (no body slam moves required)
....

after a particularly enthusiastic thrust i suddenly got a stab of pain in my side, making me curl up in agony. he mistook this for intense pleasure (apparently my pain face is similar to my sexy face? not sure how to take that one!) and kept going for a couple more plunges before it finally became obvious to him as i burst into tears!

this lead into him panicking that he'd somehow broken me with his cock (he may be overestimating there) and me trying to figure out wtf had just happened and why i was crying. i'm guessing it something to do with the lovely stabbing cramps in my right hand side of my abdomen. possibly.
cue the naked running around as he grabs hot water bottle and glass of water while i curl up on the bed, now very lacking in sex appeal.

turns out that if you have pcos (polycystic ovary syndrome), 'enthusiastic exercise' can sometimes cause a ovarian cyst to get over excited and burst! 

worst part was, we were trying to fit in this fun time before his parents came over for dinner and now, 20 minutes before they arrive am now stuck in an ungainly position on the bed, totally starkers for all to see. 
i had to phone his mum to ask if she had any ibuprofen she could bring round for me as we had none in the house and then had to try and explain exactly why i needed them. luckily she had the sense to not ask any further questions when i said it can be triggered by certain types of exercise.

managed to get husband to help me pull some clothes on moments before they arrived, so saved some of my dignity at last.
he's now convinced his dick is cursed and is going to break me again.

tl;dr- top thrust, cyst bust! ",4

"by accidentally faking my own death.. i've been getting telemarketer calls incessantly for months and it's driving me insane, most of the time i just hang up once i hear them because i'm also expecting important calls from unknown numbers.

 i was with some friends one night and we decided to order some food from our regular place, the card machine was broken and i had no cash on me so i gave the delivery driver my details and she said she'd come back to my house with the working credit card reader the next night. 

fast forward a few weeks and nearly 50 spam calls from telemarketers, i'd completely forgotten about the previous order. i get a call on my phone and i hear an asian woman ask for me, mispronouncing my last name, not unlike many telemarketers. fed up with it i yell ""no, he's not here because he died!""

not even two hours later there's a knock on my door, it was the sweet delivery lady and she brought a free meal for my household as a sympathy gift to help everyone through the ordeal of my death, while telling us not to worry about the bill from the other week.

i had my friend drop off enough money for both meals without explaining it because i felt so bad. i can't explain it to them without sounding racist and now i have to find a new chinese restaurant.

tl:dr - thought the asian delivery lady was a telemarketer, told her i died and she sent a sympathy meal to my family.

"by telling a girl i suck a lot of dick.. this happened yesterday. i'm 23m and i study it and as you can imagine we have a lot more guys than girls over here.

backstory: so our small group of friends includes one girl and 3 guys including me and we make a fair number of sexist and racist jokes. when someone in the group says something and another person misses it and asks to repeat it, we tell that person that ""you know what makes you deaf? sucking a lot of dick"". okay saying it like this sounds pretty stupid but believe me it's funny in person. 

the fuckup: i'm going home from university and i'm standing in the bus stop. my phone starts to ring. for some reason i don't notice it and it just keeps ringing. eventually a girl comes up and tells me that she thinks my phone is ringing. a normal person would have said ""ohh thanks"" but what did i say? of course i said ""oh well you know i suck a lot of dick"". she just stared at me for a second and then walked to the opposite end of the bus stop. fml.

"by climbing 999 steps with empty pockets.. quick disclaimer: this was a year ago.

i'm a huge history nerd and i absolutely love exploring ancient sites. my mother and i took a trip to greece and were on a tourbus.

one of our many stops were nafplio (which was absolutely beautiful) and our tour guide said ""if you climb 999 steps, you'll find the beautiful fortress of paladimi. the entire bus chuckled (mainly middle aged, few elders.) but being the teenage self i am, i was determined to climb those steps.

there's a slight problem however, i was really out of shape.

i am at the beginning of the staircase up the mountain and my mom (bless her heart) offered to take my wallet and the hotel keys so it wouldn't weigh me down. left me with just my phone. she decided she didn't want to join me on my hike up the mountain because (understandably) she was worn out.

i begin my ascent, around 15-30 excruciatingly painful minutes later, i make it to the top. i had a sense of pride as i stepped to the entrance of the gate. i would be able to see a part of greece that the rest of my tour bus wasn't able to see. i would have stories to tell at the dinner table. i would have amazing pictures.

suddenly, right at the door i see a sign.

""8 euros for admission"" 

and with that, i took my walk of defeat back down the 999 steps.

i left my wallet and climbed a mountain to see a historical site, only for there to be an admission fee.

"deepthroating my boyfriend after eating chocolate ice cream on valentine's day. as one might think on valentine's day in particular, people like to get up to some frisky business, myself included. after indulging in some post-dinner beer and chocolate ice cream, my boyfriend and i (f) decided to have an ""oral sex party"".  we felt creative and made up a card game that allowed us to test the luck of the draw. ~card game rules at the bottom~
each number card drawn would result in that amount of minutes of oral play performed on the partner, and if a face card was drawn, additional special features could be implemented during that turn, such as toys or fingers. each turn consisted of drawing a card and pleasuring the other orally until the timer was up. then switch and repeat until we couldn't take it anymore and would inevitably fuck. pretty straight forward.

a few turns in, i had only drawn low numbers and was itching to give him longer blowjobs as he was drawing high cards and face cards. i had just drawn a 4 which followed his 8 minute king turn, so i was incredibly turned on and really just wanted to pleasure him as he deserved. i was having the time of my life, and he clearly was too, so i went off script and ignored the 4 minute timer. i kept going deeper and deeper until i was feeling him down my throat. turned on by my own accomplishments of getting him that far back, i kept deepthroating him and when he told me he was going to cum, in my own enthusiastic dick swallowing vigor, i accidentally jammed him back to the feeling i knew there was no return from. a volcanic surge immediately erupted and i tried my darndest to swallow it back but there was just too much. i pulled back and tried, to catch it in my hands but was unsuccessful and left staring at a brown mess of the ice cream and cum on my white sheets.

luckily my boyfriend is the sweetest ever and after a quick pic\*, cleanup, and laundry cycle, we cuddled and enjoyed the rest of the night together.

\--&gt;after it happened i realized i could reap the sweet karma benefits of my misfortune and decided it was best to gather photo proof of such event. also was drunk and thought it was a good/funny memory to capture. albeit disgusting...

because y'all nasty asses wanted to see the aftermath(https://imgur.com/a/ggwdssr). it looks like shit so don't say i didn't warn you.


i guess it's inevitable with stories like these that end up blowing up to assume it's made up. here is the text(https://imgur.com/a/nqmulpq) i sent my bf asking for his approval to post because it doesn't just involve me, so i wanted to make sure he was comfortable with my sharing first. 3 years together and we continue to work on our communication and keeping each other in the loop. 

card game rules-
shuffle the desk of cards, either use half or full deck. however you're feeling in the moment. each player draws a card to flip over simultaneously. highest card is the giver in the first turn.

alternate drawing cards and going down on each other for the number of minutes you draw on your card. if you draw a face card, these were the special rules. to be changed as is fit for your relationship. ours were as follows-

jack was either only hands or only mouth for that turn. queen was the option to add a toy-vibrator for me, plug for him. king was the classic pinky in ass, other fingers in my pussy. or for him, my finger in his ass, a recent addition to our sexual escapades which i love. ace was getting to fuck, then going back to oral after that turn.

each face card that was drawn was followed by the drawing of a number to figure out how long that would last.

our rule was no cumming during the game so we could edge as long as possible before the inevitable fuck. that didn't end up happening past a few rounds...clearly.

thank you for gold x4, kind strangers! platinum too! and silver x4! i know many didn't think this was worthy of the gildings, so many thanks. will be passing on the wealth in honor of this blunder.

"gf walked in on me soaking my willy in a glass of milk. i'm in the navy, and about 4 years ago i was stationed in cuba. i had a new girlfriend that i was trying to impress by cooking her dinner (even though i was a horrible cook).

i decided i was going to make some jalapeño poppers as a side dish, and foolishly decided to use my finger to scoop out the seeds before stuffing them with sour cream.

once everything was prepared i popped them into the oven and decided to take a shower while i waited.

naturally, being a guy i decided to have a wank in the shower. no harm no foul right? 

wrong.

i felt the burn with every stroke, but i was so close to finishing i just...decided to bust a nut... and then i would figure out what to do next. (yes, i know this is my own fault, i'm not proud of it okay?)

unfortunately that 10 minutes of wanking only further cemented the juices from the jalapeños deeper into the skin of my penis. (shocking i know).

the pain soon became unbearable, i was rushing around my barracks room butt naked desperately trying anything i could think of to alleviate the pain: washing my member off with a clean towel, putting ice cubes between my penis and my ballsack, standing in front of the fan, nothing was working. 

then it dawned on me. i recalled hearing that milk can help alleviate the burn in someone's mouth after eating spicy food.. and i knew this was my only hope.

i filled up a glass with ice cold milk, set it on the floor, and squatted down on top of it, dunking my bits into the heavenly, cooling liquid.

instant relief. thank god, i said to myself. there was only one problem, the moment i took my penis back out of the milk, the pain rushed back to my lions.

so i sat there, in a squatting position, my dick afloat in a glass of milk, and realized my blinds were wide open, on a sunny afternoon. anyone could look in and see what was happening. but the pain was so bad that i couldn't keep my dick out of the milk for more than a second or two.

i decided that the only solution was to lay on the ground, face down ass up, so that if i was to flash someone at least they would only see my ass cheeks and not my burning schlong.

i laid there for about 2 hours until my girlfriend came back from work, and found me in my miserable state. 

after a lot of laughter and about 10 minutes of explaining the situation, she asked me ""why didn't you just press the glass of milk into your body with one hand, so you could walk around and put some clothes on and stuff?

needless to say, if i didn't feel like an idiot before, i did then. 

eventually a few hours later i went to the emergency room, where i was given a cream that barely worked, and i was excused from work the next day.

tl;dr

made jalapeño poppers, wanked in the shower, willy burned with the fury of a thousand sons, dipped it into a glass of milk while lying naked on the floor, girlfriend walked in. 
we are no longer dating, but i hope her thinking back on my embarrassing story puts a smile on her face now and then.

"by asking about my parenta divorce and found out i contributed to the divorce.. update: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/co5hbl/tifu_update_asking_about_my_parents_divorce_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

okay, first off, my parents have been divorced for 12+ years. i am 21 now and was 7 or 8 when they split. i found out a few years ago it was because my mom was cheating on my dad with my nurse from the nicu from 1997 (oof).

casually talking to my mom (who has since remarried for the third time) i asked about their divorce out of curiosity. she went into a few details and brought up a car ride with my dad. she wouldnt elaborate so i called my dad (big mistake)

mind you, dad took me and my sister in when my mom left and raised us. it kind of went like this:

me: ""so i was talking to mom about your divorce and she brought up a ride in the car with you that initiated the divorce""

dad: *hesitantly* "" yeah, you, me and your sister were in the car when i came back from overseas and we were talking about what you guys wanted to be when you grew up. your sister said something and you said ""i want to be a nurse like, insert his name here"". i pulled over to the side of the road and you spilled the beans""

apparently, at 7 or 8, i informed my dad about a guy staying in our house in his room sleeping in their bed while he was gone for months for military stuff. i told him everything. how mom told us he was an ""old friend"" who needed ""help"" and who would be staying with us ""to protect us while daddy is gone"". how he watched us for a week while mom disappeared, took us to movies, dinner, etc. there was a point of him asking if i would move to california with him and my mom (they got married 2 weeks after my parents divorce was finalized and moved to california)

i never remembered this occurence. he said he went home, pulled phone records, emails and even the chat messenger history (this is like 2004 or 2005 idk).

i'm not blaming myself, but, damn. little me saved my dad's ass from being used any longer by her.

note to self: dont ask too many questions.
insert big ""what the fuck"" here

tl;dr. by asking too many questions about my parents divorce and found out i'm the one who dimed my mom out for infidelity.

edit: this is a fuck up because i was apparently never supposed to know - hence my mom not wanting to talk about it and my dad being hesitant on telling me.

edit 2: super fuck up. i'm learning more and more about their marriage i never needed to know from other family. i was the ""save the marriage"" baby

edit 3: wow. i didnt realise how many other people have gone through finding out this kind of stuff later in life. kudos to all of you for learning from the example!

edit 4: holy shit! i've learned a lot from all of you! this blew up and i've made a few decisions:
-i am never getting married
-i think it's time to cut off my mom
-dont ask questions about your parents failed marriage - 

edit 5: apparently, after the divorce, she wrote my grandmother a letter stating she didnt want to take care of children and wanted to ""live her life""

also, i didnt remember this occurence because i guess it didnt really stick out to me. my dad said he acted calm and acknowledged everything, like a normal convo. the events after i remember oh so vividly.

moral of this story: dont think your kids wont talk if you're cheating and do not bring them around your kids. actually, just dont cheat 🤦‍♀️ easier said than done but damn!

also, please note, i didnt have to throw any paper for my mom to be a ho!

final edit: thanks to everyone for sharing their stories similar to mine and acknowledging that, for the children, the divorce was never their fault! these conversations have really got me thinking about how toxic for me it is to talk to my mom. i'll update in a bit. thanks guys and keep your head up if you fuck up!",4
"by having a seizure and going full mma on the six cops trying to help get me in the ambulance. checking my email is the last normal thing i remember before waking up in the hospital, except for a few scary-as-fuck bits here and there. hence, this comes from my own direct recollection, with the gaps filled in by my wife and other witnesses.

i had a full tonic-clonic seizure, right at my desk. details are mostly irrelevant, here, but i've never had a seizure before. (and initial assessment is that it was probably a ""perfect storm"" situation with a new prescription i was on that will (hopefully) never happen again.)

my wife was in the next room and of course called 911, and the ambulance showed up. problem is, i was postictal(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/postictal_state?oldformat=true), which is a post-seizure state where you're essentially not in your right mind. but when two big dudes came into my house unannounced and in a big hurry to move towards me, i went into home-defense mode. the fact that they were clearly in emt uniforms and there to help me was lost in the scrambled mess my brain was in, but my more basic instincts were working fine. i don't think i actually assaulted the emts, as they just kept their distance and radioed for police backup when i started yelling at them telling them (apparently) ""get the fuck out of my house. i don't wanna fight you.""

and so the police sent one guy.

now i remember feeling extremely protective of my wife and convinced that this home invasion was serious business now that this 3rd guy was coming towards me and attempting to physically restrain me. i don't remember, but i'd bet you dollars to donuts that the millisecond he rolled his shoulders forward and widened his stance is the second that i went from uncooperative to full apeshit; it's just what you do when you're trained to fight and there doesn't seem to be another option, as when you are protecting your family like i thought i was about to have to do.

that's when things started getting ugly. i was an amateur mma fighter about fifteen years ago with a local dojo, and while i haven't practiced for a long time, i can tell you those instincts never fully leave you. i know how to reverse any submission hold a local cop is likely to be able to proficiently attempt on me, apparently even whilst postictal. before backup arrived, i had swept the leg of the officer and had him in an armbar. thank fuck i didn't go for a blood choke whilst my brain was short-circuiting. i was also screaming (roaring, apparently) at my wife to call the police. the irony of my request was lost on me at the time. that primal roar was the scariest sound she's ever heard come out of my body, so she tells me, and i didn't stop roaring. luckily (for him and me), cop #1 didn't put up any further resistance until his backup arrived.

five more big dudes showed up (now 6 cops + 2 emts + my wife). no weapons drawn, no tasers. fortunately they knew they were walking into a medical call, and boy they should get a medal for how well they handled it.

i wasn't going down without a fight, and 1v1 was no contest even though they were way above my weight class. but with sheer overwhelming force they pretty much wore me out and then dogpiled me to the ground, cuffed me in the back, and then stood me up to walk me to the ambulance. big mistake. i easily spun my way out of the officer's control grip (hand on handcuff chain, other hand on my shoulder), and gave him a front kick to the breadbasket he probably won't forget anytime soon. ""bring it, fuckers,"" i remember thinking (or saying? who knows). i also remember being this weird mix of scared, emboldened by my recent ""escape"", and pissed *right* the fuck off, all at the same time.

still cuffed, front kicks were the new order of the day. i was like the goddamn free sample guy at the supermarket, giving them out to anyone who came near me. details are loose on what happened next, but i guess they did some kind of brute force team tackle again and got me to the ground, and from the cuts on my wrists, they may have used some kind of pain compliance technique with the cuffs. it didn't work, as i was able to shrimp my way out from underneath the guy(s) on top of me and throw a nasty double heel kick from lying down. fortunately it just grazed the guy on the shoulder rather than the neck/head, which is where i would certainly have been aiming.

next thing i remember vividly is being face down on my living room carpet barely able to breathe (thanks to being out of shape these days, with at least one big guy on my back), and thinking this was the end for me, then they'd rape my wife, and let my cat out in the cold winter night.

they weren't screwing around at this point. apparently judging it worth the risk, while i was pinned the emts shot me in the ass with some kind of chemical restraint, and the cops just sort of sat on me and let my wife try to calm me down until it had taken full effect and i was strapped to the gurney in soft restraints.

when i woke up (over a full day later--combination of insomnia + seizure + downers + 1v6 cage match really wore me out, i guess), i was bruised to shit, but aside from some minor cuts on my wrists from the cuffs and a nasty hole in my bottom lip from me biting it during the seizure, i'm a lot better off than i could have been. i have some nasty pins and needles in my hands so those cuffs must have been torqued fairly hard (by me or the cops, who knows), but i'm told by my attending doctor that should go away in about six months(!).

when got home i called the police to apologize and thank them for getting my combative ass to the ambulance. thanks to them for being incredibly good sports about the whole thing. (and not pressing charges, especially given my level of...enthusiasm.)

i'm still trying to wrap my head around just how badly this *could* have gone. yeesh. the unpredictable seizure alone is bad enough without nearly suiciding-by-cop had there been a weapon within reach. scares the bejesus out of me just knowing how absolutely out of control i was.

tl;dr: i learned exactly how many big dudes with at least basic hand-to-hand training it takes to drag me from my home against my will. (six, plus a syringe of something in the ass.)

edit: well, this was a much bigger response than i expected. thanks for all of your comments (especially those from police and medical professionals and other patients that have gone through something similar). and, wow, thanks for the gold, kind strangers.

common question was where this happened: as a few of you figured out (stalkers! lol), yes, i'm in canada, and yes it was bloody cold out at the time, even by canadian standards.",4
"giving myself head and throwing out my back. (reposted at the appropriate time with some adjustments!)

this happened about 3 days ago, i'm finally able to move and get out of bed.

so i am generously endowed, and have a very good relationship with my dick. lol. i occasionally post images on reddit and other places, and someone asked me if i could perform auto-fellatio. i hadn't ever thought of it, so i read some tips, watched some videos and realized that because of my size and my general skinny frame, i have the ideal body type for sucking my own d. how exciting lol.
so, there are a few different approaches, leaning forward or legs over your head. i tried the leaning forward approach but had no luck at all, so then i was like fuck it, got naked, layed down near a wall, threw my legs over my head, and slowly ""walked down the wall"" as the advice was. holy shit i was close. let me also say i was very aroused at the moment, and this was a few days of arousal, so my cock was extra hard and the head was pulsating. as the head flexed and i did, i got my tongue on the tip of my dick basically on the first try. wow. i was excited and turned on, and hard as fuck.

so, i started stroking and pulling my cock closer to my mouth and it started getting even harder and now i can basically put my lips on the head. it felt insane and i was so happy. as i was stroking, my lips were able to almost fully cover the head, and i started to suckle. it didn't take much. the whole situation caused a deep orgasm. the shaking kind.

sidebar- yes i came in my mouth. for reference i am totally straight and have never had a dick in my mouth. okay back to the story...

so i'm shaking, feet over my head, dick in my mouth, and the final release pushed my body into a further position, and there it was. not really sure what popped, but i collapsed onto my side and literally couldn't move. cum dripping out of my mouth, laying on my side, naked, in the bathroom.
luckily feeling came back soon and but i couldnt stand up. crawled to bed... had a friend bring me some muscle relaxers, said i tweaked it ""cleaning under the counters"" lol. still in bed, but can actually walk today for the first day. 

luckily i don't need to explain this to a doctor.

tl:dr - sucked my own d, came in my mouth, threw out my back.

edit:  thank you for all of the advice (and the offers, lol).  i will not fuck around with this any more.

edit 2: i spit, but not totally intentionally.  it was that moment that all went to hell.  not sure what i would have done if i was thinking about it.

edit 3:  c'mon guys, sucking your own dick is as gay as jerking off or playing with your ass.  get over it. if you're that afraid of you're own body, that's weird, and super homophobic

edit 4: ""i've heard it feels more like sucking dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i've never sucked a dick, so i can't tell you, and yes, it didn't feel like getting head from another person.  but it was very pleasurable and felt better than my good ol' hand.

"by scratching my neck and getting pulled over. so there i was driving down the interstate going about 70 mph minding my own business. i feel a small tickle on the back of my neck barely above threshold. i reach back to itch the feeling and bring my hand back to the wheel. it's a giant fucking spider! 



worse still, that monster took a short ride on my hand and landed in my lap. i quickly slap the crap out of this thing. well, i am not a smart man. that spider got squashed into liquified guts with my nuts on the other end. i'm not sure if anyone has ever had their nuts thunderclaped while driving but it's not conducive to maintaining your lane. the shock and vomit inducing pain cause me to jerk the wheel and at the speed i was going i proceed to do terrifying back and forth where i nearly flip my suv. naturally, a cop saw the whole thing and the blue lights go up.


so i keep my hands on wheel and the cop comes up to the window. ""son, what seems to be your problem!?"" the cop had been directly behind me and i assume he nearly rear ended me. for whatever reason he wasn't happy. ""officer, i'm not sure if you're going to believe me but take a look at my crotch real quick"" ... awkward pause...

"when i adjusted my bra in front of a cute guy.. i am cringing while writing this. i was going to a library to study (i'm in college, yay ) and i saw this cute guy as i'm walking in. i was thinking ""hot damn, he fine"" but i didn't think he saw me so i sat down at a table that was empty. it's early morning on a friday, so no one was there. i was in a rush to leave dorms, so my bra was not fitting right at all-tmi but basically only 40% of my left boob was actually in the bra.

since the library room i was in was basically empty i had the bright idea to, with both hands, grab my bra (through my shirt, don't worry)and hitch it up. i can't exaggerate this enough-this was not a sly fixing of the strap, or a gentle adjusting of a side boob: i was fondling myself. 

literally as i am grabbing my breasts, the cute boy, who was still deciding where to sit, chose to walk back in my direction and saw the whole thing, which i only realized when i looked up.

then he chose to sit next to me? i don't know why? do boys find girls who viciously yank at their bras in libraries on friday mornings attractive? but i was so embarrassed at this point, and my face was hot, so i didn't even look at him. he kept sneaking glances at me, and i have no idea what he was thinking. that i was psycho? that he had to sit in that seat because it was too late to turn back? i don't know. 

anyway, to add to this, my stomach kept rumbling in the quiet library. it's at that point that i decided i had to get out of there, and of course i tripped as i tried to stand. anyway. that's me. this is my life. thoughts? comments? help? 

tldr: a cute boy in a library saw me trying to stuff my boobs back into my bra.

"by getting a sexy surprise nsfw. obligatory, this happened this past wednesday. 

so i've been out of town the past few weeks, and my girlfriend kept talking about how she was working on a sexy role-play kind of outfit for when i got back. well, color me stoked. i get home from my work trip, and alas, no surprise. no big deal, i figure it just didn't pan out. so this is sunday, fast forward to wednesday. 

wednesday, i'm back at work.  five o'clock rolls around, i go to my car, and i drive home. i walk in, and ooohh my god. the sexy surprise. my girlfriend in a maid lingerie costume (you know the type) waiting for me in our bedroom. fantastic. we start going at it, maid costume comes off, she's on top, and i go to kind of pin her arms against her back, and bend her over top of me. well, i was a bit aggressive about it. 

i proceed to body slam her onto myself, with her shoulder coming down into my mouth with a force at least equitable to the new naval rail gun. she asks if i'm alright, it's then i realize, no, no, i'm not alright. i taste iron in my mouth, and realize that, sure enough, she's dislodged one of my teeth. it's literally lying parallel in my mouth.  not to be outdone, i tell her sure, i'm fine, rip the tooth back into place (or as close as possible), and try to keep going. she doesn't say anything at first, then she informs me that apparently i've got blood all over my mouth. she was not really into that, apparently. 

i don't have dental insurance, so i go to the er, and regale the staff there with my sexual misadventure. missed work the next day, while arguing with insurance and going to the dentist. it's been quite the surprise.

tl/dr: girlfriend's sexual surprise ends with me losing a tooth and completely blue balled. 

edit: showed this to my girlfriend, she wanted me to update to include that she took care of the blue ball situation when i got back from the hospital. 10/10.

"by pooping on my police academy hat.. been in the academy 3 months, we have to wear baseball caps that say ""police academy"" on them whenever we are outside. when we go inside we tuck the caps into the back of our pants to hold them. i ate mango habanero wings at bdubs last night and had explosive diarrhea this morning so i decided to poop before going into class. went to the stall, pulled my pants down and spewed lava for 20 minutes. when i was done i stood up, turned around to flush and noticed something under all the shit. then noticed the words ""pol"", was confused for a good 30 seconds before it hit me. drill instructor yelled at me for being outside without a cover, asked me why, and instead of the usual ""no excuse sir"", i told him. he laughed for 5 minutes, first time i've ever seen him smile. he gave me a new cover and told all the other instructors who now call me ""shit head"".

"by trying to put deodorant on in an airplane bathroom. husband just messaged me mid-flight with this story (his fu not mine, but shared with his permission):

""so i got up to put some deodorant on in the bathroom. the kind with the roller ball. i go to put it on and nothing is coming out. so i do a quick flick of it to get the liquid inside moving. worst case scenario the roller bar goes flying off and liquid deodorant goes flying everywhere. mirror, walls, floor... e v e r y w h e r e...

"and almost died in the most hilarious way possible. not today as per usual. but 18 years ago.

i had moved to california a few years earlier. a few blocks away was a grocery store. in that store was a toy section. back then. 1998? it just had an assortment of coloring books and some ""squeaky"" toys. rubber animals you would squeeze to make a noise. i would grab the ""squeak"" thing from those toys. they are the size of a pill or vitamin. if i placed it in my mouth and pulled it to the back i could talk while making a stupid noise. one time heading back to my friends after grabbing a fresh squeaker i accidentally chortle\ snorted and inhaled the thing. i'm behind the store now ready to hop the stone wall back home. no one is around. nor will there be til the trash is dropped at end of night. so i'm choking. but instead of a gasp its a loud squeak. reeeeeet, ruuuuuh. i'm grasping at my chest. reereet, ruuuh. my vision fades and a fall down on my back. this dislodges the squeaker with one more loud reet. after a moment on the ground i get up and go home. deciding i'll never take a squeaker again.

"getting high before dinner with my girlfriend's parents. i was at my girlfriends parents house about to eat dinner, her mom had a big spread made up for build-your-own-tacos.

now at this dinner i was unbelievably baked out of my fucking mind. i mean i smoked a lot of damn weed with my roommate before leaving because my nerves were getting to me since this was my first time meeting her parents.

so fast forward a bit and we're all making our plates, and i go last because i'm trying to be respectful.

i make my plate with a few tacos and think no big deal, just gonna finish up here and go sit down with the others.

now when i sat down i noticed something was different about everyone. my girlfriend was trying to contain laughter while her parents had the most confused faces i've ever seen.

to try and break the ice i ask ""what happened?"" my girlfriend looks over at me and asks if i'm feeling okay whilst containing her laughter. then she looks down at my plate to get me to see what i'd done.

and my god you guys, the fucking embarrassment.

i put spanish rice full to the brim in my taco shells and i had the meat and other toppings scattered on the side in a mess on my plate. i was backwards in what i was trying to do but was too high to notice.

i didn't make a very good first impression because to this day they think i'm some kind of lunatic.

"by trying to gay up my new apartment and triggering a swat response.. my partner and i pulled my car into the parking lot of the library. it was a hot summer day and we were there to use the wifi and checkout a couple books and return a couple that were overdue. i'd been inside about ten minutes when some commotion started in the parking lot. my partner noticed and decided to go gawk at it while i finished up. 


another five minutes go by and my partner hadn't returned. i'd seen a few police cars go by. i decided to go see what all the fuss was about. heading to the door i notice they're all clustered near my car. ""well this isn't good."" on closer examination i notice my partner approaching the group of officers. they'd just arrested some guy. exiting i overheard the second half of the conversation. 


""... and then you entered that vehicle, the blue one?""


""yes officer.""


""and took these items?""


""yes officer."" 


""and you entered these vehicles?"" the officer motioned to the row of cars, including mine. 


""yes.""


there wasn't much of value in my car. a few days prior we had picked up a few items at a garage sale for the new apartment for cheap. i wasn't too concerned -- none of the windows in any of the cars appeared smashed or anything. behind the officers a swarm of vehicles had boxed in another, a boring sedan. the door was ajar and inside i could see another officer setting items on the hood. it was a modest collection. none of my possessions appeared to be in the rather sizeable pile on the vehicle's hood.


he added nervously, ""except that one."" he motioned to my beat up saturn. and i say beat up, but really it looked like something out of mad max. the hood and quarter panel were painted flat black, while the rest of the car was purple. it was coated in a veneer of rust all over the underside, looking like it had been ridden hard and put up wet. 


my partner raised her voice, ""hey! why not my car?!"" well, i approached to correct her. i would regret this decision shortly. the officer gave a quizzical look at the would-be thief. 


""yes, why not *that* car?"", the officer says, turning back to the thief. 


at this point, i'd reached the small crowd and announced myself. ""excuse me, it's actually my car."" i got a polite nod, and the officers continued. i gave a questioning and slightly annoyed towards my partner. the thief, now appearing quite anxious, retorted ""because of the dead body!"" 


there was a moment of silence as all the officers jerked up and all looked at him, then my car. then me and my partner, all in rapid succession. they all reflexively put their hands on their sidearm and one of them looked at the two of us and said rather sharply ""don't move."" great. so now we've gone from petty theft to body stashing. an officer keyed up his radio to call for backup, ""suspicion of murder, suspects at gunpoint."" visions of officers opening the trunk to find some gruesome scene flashed through my head. my stomach braced. my partner and i exchanged nervous looks.


two other officers approached the car and peered into the back seat. at the same time then the guns came out of the holster and the two of them turned their attention to us, yelling, ""get on the ground!"" well this day is off to a great start. we've gone from overdue library books to murder. me and my partner both complied, while other officers opened up my car. i heard some excited noises from them followed by silence, ""uh chief, you better come see this."" both of them were grinning and looking back at the thief, who looked pale as a ghost. the plot sickens.


a third, rather larger man sauntered over and then burst out laughing, ""let them up,"" gesturing towards the officer with his knee in my back. ""okay, what the actual fuck is going on,"" i wondered to myself. the chief is practically out of breath from choking down laughter and tells his subordinate with the thief to go ahead and put him in the back of a squad car. we both approach nervously and peer into the car.


it was only then i realized what had happened. the thief had been going through the cars and skipped ours because, in the back seat, was a pile of mannequin parts. we'd found them in an alleyway a couple days prior in the esteemed loring park area, perhaps the gayest part of the twin cities. i'd entirely forgotten about them. we had intended to use them to decorate our new, and rather empty, apartment, and nothing says queer quite like a fashion mannequin holding coats by the door. he must have spotted them and decided they were the chopped up remains of someone. 


now, we both knew they looked realistic enough because we'd managed to scare the shit out of a former roommate who liked to rummage through our stuff by leaving an arm and some pillows under a blanket to make her think one of us was sleeping there and discourage snooping. but of course, she'd gotten too curious and gotten a dose of karma for her trouble. and now all the officers were taking turns, looking back at us, and grinning ear to ear at us and the idiot thief. in the end, we were left with many apologies and another tale for friends of my fabled car of the damned. a few minutes later a swat truck, driven by some bored officers, pulled up and took their turn looking and laughing.


tl;dr - was nearly given the chair for murdering a mannequin and overdue library books. 


edit: obviously officers don't talk like this. it happened a decade ago. forgive my attempt at recreating long forgotten conversation. also, yes, it really was swat. no, i can't explain it either. ",4
"by walking into my son's bedroom without knocking while he was with his girlfriend. my son is 18 and we generally get along pretty well, though he's going through his own life and i'm trying to respect that.

so i came home after work, him after school, i decided to visit his room to ask him what he wanted for dinner and to maybe play some mario kart.

i'm still mortified at what i found...

i walk in, fully clothed my son's girlfriend is on all fours on the bed, my son's face is buried into her butt... she stares at me with the widest eyes i've ever seen and within milliseconds releases what can only be described as the ""horns of the apocalypse"" and farts directly into my son's face. 

he falls backward off the bed, brings down an entire table on top of him, she falls off the front of the bed flipped completely upside down, vertically. he yells ""dad!!"" when suddenly the contents of his entertainment center come crashing down on him.

i rush to his aid, the room smells of some kind of mix of tunafish and hard boiled eggs. my son's pants are down, he's crying and i'm panicking trying to unbury him below the rubble. 

his girlfriend then runs out of the room and heads for the bathroom, all i can hear are explosive noises that could break glass with soundwaves.

my son is bleeding, i haven't said one word at this point. i muster the strength i have to get him to the car for an er visit. i try to get his girlfriend but all i hear from the bathroom is a mix of crying and fart trumpets exploding.

in a moment of weakness i back up and just leave my house locking the door.

my son's alright now, physically anyway. i'll update if he gets pink eye. his girlfriend hasn't contacted us so i can assume she's still going to town. i'm no longer hungry so dinner's out.

tl;dr walked in on my son burying his face into his girlfriend's anus, she farts, he falls off bed and takes down a table and his entertainment center.

**update**

thanks so much for the gold! i originally just wanted to type this out as a literal ""tifu"", as in i felt like i had really screwed up and wanted some support. i misunderstood the humor this subreddit is usually used for; i should have been more discreet with details to say the least. i never anticipated for a second this would grow to this level.

my son is fine, he just ended up with a few scrapes and bruises. i was mainly concerned at the site of blood added by the fact that all the objects falling down on him were pretty heavy game systems, figurine statues and the like.

we haven't spoken much about the incident, but i did pry a few details out, in the least judgmental, kind way i could think to. 

they had the house to themselves, it started with cuddling as she didn't feel very well (obviously) and he admitted he just wanted to ""sniff"" her butt. she was probably reluctant to reveal how she didn't feel very well. we *are* talking, but not much. he's let out a few chuckles and smiles with red face. i realize walking in was a huge violation of privacy, but i am trying my very best to band-aid this. he is aware of the reddit post but doesn't mind.

when we got home the bottom lock on the door was locked and she was nowhere in sight. she hasn't contacted him at all since it happened, but in a few days or whenever she gets back to him i plan on driving him over to see her, and giving her the kindest smile and wave i can muster, all jokes suppressed. 

if any of his gaming stuff is damaged i plan on fully replacing them, and getting him new stuff as an apology.

a few answered questions:

* i did not enter the room with my pants off. i was fully clothed, she was fully clothed, his pants were merely down. i originally typed out the in a hurry while we sat down.

* i'm unsure what caused the massive explosion and upset stomach, but i suspect it was already brewing before i walked in, and she was trying to suppress it when she became a deer in headlights when i walked in.

* i will knock before entering or maybe even call him the next time i get home! i realize now i invaded his privacy pretty heavily.

* the room does still faintly smell, and febreze just lingers in the air with the smell. i suspect she did more than fart on his face...

* no pink eye luckily, either of us, yet

i'll update again if anything worth noting happens",4
"by having the fbi pull me out of class. obligatory *""this happened a few months ago.""*

this was easily the most stressful roller-coaster of an event that i hope i ever experience. 

the scene is freshman year of college. i'm a wide-eyed innocent student having a great time away from his parents. i've made some good friends and enjoy messing with them. as such, i decide to pull a little prank on them. it starts with a simple idea: i'm going to ohio on a business trip. i was actually going to lunch with my parents, but this was a more fun story. i hadn't initially thought out this entire prank, but just like high school presentations, i decided to wing it. every so often i would go on these out-of-state ""business"" trips, but i stayed vague as to what my business was. i told them that it was somewhat illegal, but in more of a gray area.

my friends were incredibly intrigued by my illicit endeavors, and as time went on, they began to ask more questions about this business. i still had little to no plan for this ordeal, but boy did i milk it. i had them convinced that there were overseas bank accounts with millions of dollars in them and that i had several people involved in this business. at one point i told them the story of how one of my employees got caught trespassing on government property and i had to pay $10,000 to bail him out. i would ""accidentally"" send a picture of several thousand dollars, claiming it was meant to go to someone else with no other explanation.

this went on for several months up until about april. the semester was coming to a close, and i had to figure out a finale for my little project. my roommates were in on my prank and several iterations of plans were discussed. the final version of this ~~bad idea~~ plan was as follows: i will create an email address posing as the chief of police at my college. in the email, the officer (we'll call him bill myers) will inform my friends that he is currently looking to bring in shorttail359 for questioning. i was very specific to say that no one should call 911 or contact anybody outside of this email address with the excuse that there was no official investigation so bill was looking into the matter himself. i then went on to explain how shorttail359 is conducting a business out of university housing and that this is all we know but the business might be illegal/dangerous. in summation: email me if you know of shorttail359's whereabouts, don't call 911, don't contact anyone else in the police department.

i figured i covered my bases and sent the email. it was very well worded and quite convincing to a group of people who already believed i was running a secret business. sure enough, my friends bought it hook line and sinker. one of them replied, informing bill that she didn't know anything about my business, other than that i mentioned it occasionally. three friends ignored the email altogether, and one texted me saying she didn't believe it.

the next three days were interesting. i had several classes with these people and finals were upon us so skipping class was not a good idea, but i had to make them believe i was on the run. fortunately some of these classes had several hundred students and i was able to sit far away from our usual spots. the smaller classes i avoided altogether. meals were eaten at odd times, and at one point i had to hide in the shower because a friend was in my dorm. i had no contact with the prank-ees outside the occasional text.

fast forward to the thursday i decided would be the day to reveal my shenanigans. i'm walking into class when these two men in suits stop me just inside the door. they ask me if i am shorttail359 and upon confirming this they tell me they need to speak with me outside. we walk downstairs to the building's lobby where i am greeted by two more men who have guns at their sides. all four of them hold up their badges in dramatic fashion and one introduces himself as ""agent michael scarn with the fbi"" (fake name obviously). it was approximately at this point that i peed a little bit as i realized that i was in some trouble.

agent scarn: ""do you know why we're here?""

shorttail359: ""no, but i have a pretty good guess.""

agent scarn: ""well why don't you tell us what your guess is?""

i proceeded to explain the email i sent out along with a brief summary of the genesis of my prank. 50 minutes of questioning later and i had given agent scarn the password to the email account, signed an agreement saying i won't access the account or i'd face several charges, given a written statement of the events, crapped my pants twice, and completely missed my class. agent scarn gave me his business card and said they would be in touch.

i go back to my dorm and try to come to terms with the fact that i may have ruined my future career and life altogether. all my friends had a good laugh at my expense but not before i had a good laugh at their expense for believing my stupid business story. after a long sleepless weekend i get a call from a sergeant at the police station. he says that he needs to meet with me and we arrange a time. i go down to the station and for 10 minutes all he does is yell at me and tell me what a stupid idea this was. now i'm a pretty good kid. never got in trouble in school, honor roll, never so much as a speeding ticket, so having a police officer yell at me was a new experience. he finally calms down enough for me to explain that this is an anomale and that it was supposed to be an innocent prank. he believes me and tells me that regardless, they're going to charge me with criminal impersonation which is a class a misdemeanor. my court date is set for a couple weeks from now and that was the end of it.

i go to court fully prepared to leave with a no longer perfect record. as the staff is processing me and taking my mugshot, a lady asks me what my name is. i tell her shorttail359, when a guy jumps around the corner and yells ""but you can just call him chief bill myers!"" this was a much needed laugh and also informed me that word of my idiocy had gotten around town. i go into the court room and waited for this lighthearted judge to call my name. most of the charges were speeding tickets or marijuana related so the judge was moving pretty quickly. however, he calls my name and then pauses. i walk up to the podium and he's still paused, clearly reading over my file. he looks up at me, and then back down at my file again. after reading it completely through, he just starts laughing. several minutes go by before he finally asks me if i have any sort of criminal history. i tell him i don't have so much as a speeding ticket and he asks if i would like to keep it that way. i happily say yes and he give the da my paperwork. the da asks for my story and tells me that he's never seen anything like this before (something i had heard several times at this point). he informs me that this is something they could have expunged as long as i pay my court fees. i thank him and go back to waiting for the judge to call me up again.

when he does, a smile immediately dawns his face and he begins to chuckle. at this point i'm relieved enough to let out a giggle of my own since i can feel the entire court room wondering what i've done. the judge tells me that he will expunge my charge and asks me if i will ever do something like this again. i assure him that i will not and he says, with a smile on his face, ""you know son everyone in this court room is wondering who you impersonated, but i'm going to do something that you should have done and keep my mouth shut."" i thank him and sheepishly walk out of the room.

later that day i took the required documents back to the court and had the whole charge expunged in a matter of hours. it was easily the most stressful month of my life and was not worth it at all, but i am now able to walk around with an fbi agent's card in my wallet and keep a fond memory of being laughed at by a judge.

tl;dr: i play a prank on my friends that ends with me being questioned by 4 fbi agents for almost an hour and charged with criminal impersonation.

"by finding out i've been accidentally dating and fucking my half-sister, after taking a 23andme dna test. (edit 2)proof:(https://i.imgur.com/z0zm9xi.png)

throwaway, obviously. i also made the same post(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/af5eex/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/) over at r/23andme.

i just found out a few hours ago and my girlfriend and i are currently a mental wreck. 

quick background

my girlfriend (i'll refer to her as sarah) and i have been dating for a little over than a year and our relationship has been going very well. we both happen to come from the same town and met each other in college after being introduced by a mutual friend of ours.

here's where the fu begins to unravel

last year for christmas, sarah decided to come over and stay with me at my apartment for the holidays. i also had decided not to go home for the holidays either. plus, all my other roommates were back home visiting family, so we had the whole place to ourselves. it was perfect. 

christmas day rolls around, and sarah had bought the both of us 23andme dna kits. the thing is, is that we were both conceived by in-vitro fertilization via sperm donors. both of our fathers were infertile so our parents had no choice. deep down, the both of us were hoping to find our biological fathers through the service.

fast forward less than a month later to today, and both of our results are in. sarah comes over to spend the weekend and we go through our results together on our laptops. we compare our ancestry and health reports and nothing seems off. i even found out i'm 2% native american. all was well until we arrived at the ""dna relatives"" section...

sarah tightly holds my hand and says ""i hope we both find our fathers"". then i open mine up....

at the top of my screen, i see sarah's name.... ""27% dna shared...half-sister..........""

sarah starts hysterically laughing and tells me to stop joking. 

i don't react to anything she says, and just stare at my screen in disbelief. 

i then abruptly grab her laptop and open up her ""dna relatives"" section. we see the same thing. my name at the top... ""27% dna shared...half-brother"" 

at this moment my brain just completely short-circuits.....

i've been having sex with my half-sister. holy fucking shit. wtf

my mind starts going a 100mph and i began hyperventilating, going into a state of shock. i can't even remember what sarah was doing at this time.

it's pretty self-explanatory by now, but for those of you who don't understand how we could be related, it turns out our moms were probably both fertilized by the same sperm sample. what are the fucking odds, right? the fact that we're from the same town certainly increased the odds but still. 
 
6 hours later, just typing this entire post makes my body shiver. there are no words i have to express what my mental state is now. to put it in simple words: i feel traumatized. part of me still won't stop thinking about how much i love sarah and then i realize our entire relationship was incest. i honestly feel disgusted standing in my own skin. i've even been contemplating suicide.

sarah and i haven't talked at all since going into shock. 

right as i'm finishing up this post, sarah has grabbed her stuff and left my apartment a few moments ago.

i'm probably not going to respond to any of your comments/questions for now and i honestly want to be left alone in the corner of my room. i really just needed a place to vent all this.

tl;dr: former gf and i are both sperm donor babies and come from the same town. we take a 23andme dna test and find out we're each other's half-sibling. meaning i've been having sex with my sister for over a year. turns out we both were conceived from the same sperm sample, go figure. 

i do not give permission for my post to be used in the making of any movie, story, book, etc. 

edit: my mates just came home and are giving me support. 

edit 2: rip inbox. thank you all so much for the support. i just logged back in and didn't really expect this post to blow up. last night was rough. sarah's friend/roommate called letting me know sarah was home. as of now, sarah and i still haven't talked. but after an night of thinking, i believe i've come to terms with what we've discovered. for those of you who still think this is fake (i honestly wish it was), here's a screenshot showing our shared dna (https://i.imgur.com/z0zm9xi.png).
i think the best way for sarah and i to heal is to go back home (our town) and see how this all began with our families. only then will we be able to accept the reality. i'll post more updates as things develop.  ",4
"by buying a house that wasn't attached to the sewer and discovering this fact while crawling through my own plops nsfw. obligatory this was a while ago.

so it's a known fact amongst friends and family that i always have a poop or fart joke waiting to go. it's just who i am. you can have your turgid penis and voluptuous vagina jokes, i'll take a heaving helping of poop jokes with a squelching mound of fart stories any day of the week. if you've shat your pants in public i want to know, the more public and embarrassing the better, it's not a sex thing i swear; i've just always been like that since i was a young child. there is something inherently humorous to a subject so personal and private and that will never change. 

that knowledge combined with the events i am about to relay to you make me wonder if perhaps we do live in a world where unseen forces act to maximize the comedic value of my life.

some don't believe me when i tell them this tale but there's a link at the end with video evidence so suspend your disbelief and prepare to be grateful for your moderate home repair issues, it could be far worse.
here we go.

my wife and i bought the house with a few minor problems that were handled during closing like all deals are, we knew there would be a few surprises from what friends and family said so we stashed some money aside and opened a home depot card for the promotional no interest purchases. 

sure enough the floor wasn't insulted in the downstairs and since the crawlspace was hard to get around in to the inspector never caught it. i went ahead and purchased a load of insulation to re-insulate, whatever. it was summer and after getting married a few months earlier then moving we were exhausted so we worked on the interior of the house and the yard for the remainder of the good weather.

during this time we'd get the occasional whiff of something stanky but didn't think much of it. i'd buy some draino and the smell would go away. ok, the house has some plumbing issues, no biggie, $7 a week until we got the rest of the home under control and we'd get a plumber in to take look.
it's the week before thanksgiving and i finally get under the house to work on that insulation. it's cooler and everything is drying out for the winter. 

i've been in some crawl spaces that would gross the average human out before but this place, jesus fucking christ this place took the cake, blew a load all over it, force-fed it to a drugged out former child actor then bottled the shit they produced for resale at the local farmer's market as a skin care product it was so evil. i knew right then we were in for a ride, the house had been flipped and if it wasn't visible during a tour it had not been fixed.

that week i found 2 dead cats, an old stereo system from the 80s that had been hulk smashed, a car wheel, a broken window for a bar from new hampshire (we're in new york) and so much insulation it took fifteen extra large trash bags to remove among other random debris. even with a respirator my nose still get clogged and i spend the remainder of the day with no sense of smell.

anyone who knows anything about homes will tell you when someone flips a house they tend to buy shitholes and plug them with some spackel to keep the streams of festering shit at bay before selling them to unsuspecting dupes like us. 

if you're buying a home that's been flipped negotiate like you're fucking the shit out of a fresh coconut that will be thrown away immediately like any normal person would because i guarantee you that those sellers have been hiding cum filled coconuts in the walls just waiting for you to find as you settle in and attempt to make changes to the home. they don't give a fuck if the place falls apart next year because the reality of real estate law is it's buyer beware. they deserve to make as little as fucking possible for their ""trouble"" so go in fucking if you want to come out satisfied. then again i'm biased as you will come to find out.

so i'm under the house two days before thanksgiving and hauling bags of old insulation out through a tiny hole i can barely fit through. my wife tells me she's going to take a shower and won't be able to help if i need anything. i crawl back under and figure i'll grab another bag or two and call it quits.

then i hear the water. if you're a homeowner the worst sound you can hear is water running where it shouldn't be. that's better than never hearing the water but it still means there's a lot of water where it shouldn't be any and if you don't find it things get messy fast.i didn't know much but i knew that.

i hear a splattering that is roughly equivalent of a shower running but it sounds like water is pouring into a pool. i've owned a home for less than 4 months at this point so everything makes me nervous but this struck fear in my heart. it's even coming from the corner of the crawlspace the inspector couldn't get to because of ductwork making this urgent andsuper inconvenient.

i'm about 100 pounds lighter than the inspector so i squirm my way over the main sewer line and over the field of nasty old insulation that would still take another ten bags to remove. clouds of fiberglass cat piss dust are billowing and making it hard to see through my respirator. i wriggle under the main return air duct just barely making, something shifts and the fucker slides about 3 inches closer to the ground making a return from this side of the crawlsapce impossible. i sigh and keep going. my nose is always clogged from the moment i get down there, something about that dust just immediately makes it impossible for me to smell anything for a good couple of hours even though i make sure the respirator fits snugly against my face.

the light of my headlamp illuminates the problem, there's a stream of water pouring from somewhere between the joists. i think to myself ""great! the pipe broke?!"" and crawl forward to the sparkling stream. i climb over a mound and down the other side onto what i thought was dirt but the moment i touched it the layer of dirt on the water rippled with the water beneath it. i see the brown ripples spreading but it's too late and the cool water floods into my gloves, moments later i realize my entire torso is wet as the water soaks through my jumpsuit. ""what the fuck!?"" this is more than a single shower. this is, like a month of showers in a dusty lake under our house. the water stops running and i decide it's time to just get out of the crawlspace and call the plumber. we put away money specifically for stuff like this, it won't be fun but whatever.

i'm moister than an oyster at this point and take a soggy second to look over the tangle of pipes and mountains of dirt - weird the floor should be flat but whatever - searching for a path to where there's a space behind the furnace i'll be able to slide through. i see it and start slogging through the sludgy mud trying to figure out what it's going to cost to drain this water so the plumber can work. 

the i hear it. a toilet flush. it didn't hit me until it hit me, the better part of a flush splattered across my back unleashing a sub-human scream of disgust and outrage. i turned back to try to see where it's coming from and respirator caught on a random old pipe sticking out of the ground sliding to the side. 

a whiff of unadulterated corruption made it to my clogged crawlspace dust filled sinuses. jesus, buddha, sagan, anyone with temporal admin rights wind this horror story back and get me out of here. send me back to the womb, let me start over, i want to start over; we have to go back, kate!
i'm sure you're thinking ""why the fuck would my wife shit after showering?"" i thought same thing, to be honest i don't know, she married me; i livestream jars of meat for my own personal entertainment, i guess she's going to be a little off, too.

the realization of how far up shit's creek i am soaked into my brain at the same speed of that which soaked into my back. the upstairs bathroom wasn't on the tax documents prior to the seller's ownership, it was part of the renovation. someone fucked up bigly and since the house wasn't occupied after the renovation this is only now coming to light. holy shit i'm crawling through three months of shit, my shit, my wife's shit, my father in law's shit! 

memories of every shit i'd taken since moving in coursed through a mind imploding with revulsion like some nightmarish montage complete with the disembodied image of some arch nemesis cackling in the corner of the vision. we had numerous taco nights, i had discovered a sale on discount hot dogs a month earlier and had an entirely unrelated case of food poisoning a week after that was so bad i was showering instead of wiping. all of that was down here, with me, on me, soaking into me.

the panic set in and i scrambled up and over the mound that when it broke under my frantic grasping revealed yet-to-decompose toilet paper and slimy fecal matter complete with a visible kernel of corn, the metaphorical cherry on top of this unholy shit-cake that i was scrambling through.

five minutes later my wife comes downstairs and finds me in the downstairs shower, which was also not attached to the sewer, crying hysterically, the stress of finding one thing after another leading up to me crawling through my own waste had been too much. i could only hope that in time the stains burned into my memory would fade.

today we joke about it because what the fuck else can you do? we had it fixed, we moved on. we still can't believe we never smelled it bad enough to think more than a backed up drain. we started taking classes on how to repair your own home and are learning as much about basic home repair as we can. we are wiser and more capable today, this kind of disaster won't happen again.

since i've been asked here's my meatstream. i think  the heat wave killed the maggots. edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt2i6vybcsy meatstream is back, the heatwave made my laptop overheat. edit: also on twitch, https://www.twitch.tv/chriswalkerguy

to answer your questions yes we had an inspector and no new york state does not hold inspectors liable for anything but after several other far more expensive issues and discovery of discrepancies in the sale documents an attorney has taken the case.

tl;dr i bought a house where the sellers had not attached the pipes to the sewer and the crawlspace prevented the inspector from catching it. i learned about this 3 months after the sale while crawling through the puddle of poops. ",4
"by telling my friend to go ahead and send a picture. this happened 1 week ago. i'm a man, my best friend is a woman. it was before class and i had my laptop opened up to chat... 

she had said to me, for whatever reason, ""do you wanna see me eat this taco?""

and i, being open to and accepting of her antics, replied ""do i ever!""

after a few minutes of nothing back, i went up to ask the professor a question. while the professor was explaining something to me i noticed a very dramatic flurry of reactions from those seated around my computer screen.

now, my friend is great but she is also wildly inappropriate and i knew immediately that she had sent something super weird... everyone was staring and laughing at me. one guys was smiling and nodding. i could feel my whole head turning beat red as i took the long walk back to my seat.

when i got back my heart lurched as i saw that what she had actually sent was essentially a picture of her deepthroating a burrito while looking directly into the camera... to make matters worse, she had typed ""you pervert"" across the top in big blue letters, so there was no possible way to interpret it as anything else... i was horrified. how do you explain to your classmates the kind of friendship dynamic that leads up to you getting pictures like that?

after that point there was no coming back, every single thing i did or said somehow seemed to confirm in everyone's mind that i am just some weirdo dude who gets girls to send him pictures of them choking on food... i am still super embarrassed and probably will be until this class is over.

tl;dr: my friend sent me a weird and suggestive photo that my entire class saw and now everyone thinks i get off to girls stuffing food down their throat.

edit: wow gee thanks guys i was hoping by sharing this amusing story that i would be made to question all my feelings. simply grand!

edit: i'm not gonna show the picture i got too many messages from people who want it for masturbatory reasons.",4
"by confessing to my friend i wanted to fuck her. obligatory this happened on monday. so, i have been single for a while and a friend of mine gave me a contact last year, saying you and this girl will probably get along well. and that we did, from december to this month we have steadily been growing closer and having tonnes of fun along the way. sans sexual flirting though. i even nicknamed her my almost soulmate because things just flowed between us. until last week friday when i decided to visit her for easter (she stays in a nearby city).

now remember i've been single for a long time.  and my raging-hormone to logic ratio is at an all time high, thanks to a total lack of outlets. so when she said the entire visit should be spent indoors i thought finally. this is where it happens. i packed 2 condoms to the visit and sprayed deo like a mad man. got there and things were going great really, until after one hour of youtube videos i got nervous and then desperate but i didn't make a move. for some reason i believed something would magically happen and we would end up in sexy time. you can imagine my inevitable disappointment when i had to leave.

so just before we parted she suggested we take pictures and i said cool but really all i could think about was how i had failed at the only booty chance i had had in a year. needless to say i didn't look overly enthusiastic, or even remotely happy on the pictures. which apparently bothered her as she thought i didn't want pics with her because she is ugly (which she isn't) and for the weekend she kept on bringing it up and i kept on saying i was really anxious to travel back home in time. which of course she didn't buy and eventually i thought hey let me just tell her the truth. so on monday i sent her a pic of the condoms and explained my disappointment and sexual frustration, trying to reassure her that she isn't ugly.

and now, well, its been 3 days since we spoke. thanks, hormone monster.

**tl;dr: confessed that i was disappointed we didn't get to sexy time with a good friend and now she won't text me**

**edit: so, this kinda blew up lol. thanks for the silver, kind strangers! and uhhh as for those suggesting i have zero social knowledge you're absolutely right, had no idea i would receive my awakening from this app. also thanks to all the kind inboxes offering advice. and i know this is sad but the meta jokes around my post history are killing me! spray moderate deo y'all. oh and since when is sexy time no longer standard nomenclature??**

&#x200b;

**update**: we are now talking again but it's still understandably slow and too early to tell if the conversation will be sustainable. and yes, i did apologize profusely, she mostly expressed confusion as to why i thought something would happen but that's a whole different story. thanks to all the people giving advice in the comments, i'm hoping it helps me both short and long term. as for the special strangers who rightly sensed that i would be overwhelmed with some of the negativity (honestly its just the people taking my other posts out of context or at least putting them in this context), i am truly amazed at your genuine kindness. i hope to be a similar positive influence one day.",4
"by listening to my dad and beating my bully's ass *proof*. ok...i was awakened this morning by my dad saying, ""hey dude! you're famous!"" last night he posted a story about me giving my bully a beatdown. we read through the comments together and i want to say that i am overwhelmed at the support i have recieved, not only for knocking my bully tfo but also for the two surgeries i went through. first of all, i wanted to give you guys some proof because i keep seeing post about this being fake. here are some pics of me, before and after my surgeries and a shamless karma whoring pic of my dog and family. we are a big clan and we are very close.

to clarify, the kid who hit me in the chest was a good friend of mine. he did not intend to hurt me. we were just clowning around. the kid who bullied me would just slap me or punch me. i thought he would stop but he never did. i didn't want my brother to do anything about it because i was scared he would get hurt again. he had a level 2 traumatic brain injury from a mountain biking accident and everyone is very protective of him. to those of you who say i should have told on the kid. that is a terrible idea. that would just serve to put a bigger target on my back. then it would have been twenty bullies hitting me every day. 

also, i feel bad for the kid i hit. i feel like his home life isn't all that great. he is always looking for attention. i tried talking to him afterwards but he didn't want to. i did talk to his brother, though, and he was glad i punched him. 

as far as the surgey goes, i think i will do a ama on that because i saw a lot of questions about it from people who have pectus and are curious about the surgery. 

tl;dr: my dad posted about me beating up my bully and now i spent an entire sunny, idaho day inside reading posts and laughing at my dad.",4
"by gluing my ass cheeks together before a long awaited date. so there is this girl who lives a state away from me, and she had been planning to come visit me for three months. the plan was for her to come over when i got off work at 930am. 

i had worked three overnights in a row and i didn't have time to clean my apartment or get myself ready for her visit in the days prior due to being exhausted and/or at work.

flash forward to this morning. i get off work around 825 and have an hour to get home and get ready before she gets there. 

i made it home and had 30 mins to spare. i decided that at most i needed 5 mins to shower so i figured i had time to clean up a little bit. as i'm finishing cleaning, about to get in the shower, she texts me and says she will be 15-20 minutes late. (this is where the cascading failures begin).

15-20 mins isn't a lot of time, but i thought it was enough to get my downstairs trimmed up, just in case things got physical. 

at first i tried to use an electric razor and it was going pretty well. it quickly turned to shit and cut my right nut twice in like 10 seconds. i decided that there is no way i could finish this without my manhood looking like a murder scene. 

i was panicking and had no idea what to do, seeing as she'd be there in less than 10 minutes and my undercarriage was in shambles. i went to put my razor away under the sink and noticed a box of self waxing strips that my friend had left behind when she was helping me wax my back. perfect.

i didn't have time to read the directions, so i ripped to strips open and place them both into the middle of the jungle down there. i went to pull the first strip off and was greeted with extreme resistance and searing pain. once again, i was too committed to not finishing and time was running out. i made the decision to rip the second strip off and just jump in the shower and hope that the encounter didn't turn physical.

as soon as i go to wash the wax from my nether regions i realize that an enormous amount of extremely sticky wax is still all over my crack. i frantically try every soap i had in my shower to get it off. i even tried to use a coffee ground face mask (that was unpleasant).

at this point, somehow the wax sticky factor had quadrupled and i was 2 minutes away from her arrival. 

i said fuck it and dried off and got dressed. 

she called me to say she was here and i got up to answer the door, when i realized that my boxers were stuck to my ass and that my ass cheeks were firmly stuck together. no time to figure it out now. 

we chatted for a while and things ended up moving into a physical direction. she could tell that i was wincing in pain when i moved around and she kept asking what was wrong. i played it off as muscle cramps.

this worked fine until she went to take off my boxers and could feel the resistance of the wax glue from my cheeks and crack.

she immediately looked concerned and i had no choice but to tell her what had gone down moments before her arrival. it has been a long time since i've been that embarrassed. 
 
the kicker is that once she stopped hysterically laughing at me, she pointed out that the wax kit comes with after wax removal wipes that i had failed to see during my frantic decision to wax in the first place.


tl,dr: i accidentally glued my ass cheeks together with a cheap self waxing kit, moments before a girl came over and i couldn't get the wax off my ass before she got there.

edit: sorry y'all, i fell asleep after typing this. didn't know so many people needed closure. i was successful in the mission with ""my rear flank exposed."" my ass cheeks got stuck to the sheets more than a few times and more than a few more hairs were removed that way, but all in all it went relatively well considering the circumstances.

edit 2: changed the infamous ""his"" to the proper pronoun. sorry to ruin the conspiracy theories

edit 3: yes, for all of those interested, we had sex and i am seeing her again today. also, i was talking to my best friend on snapchat during the whole process and have a video of my reaction to the first strip being removed. i can post the link if anyone wants proof this happened

"by asking my neighbor ""who died?"". so this happened like 2 hours ago, but it needs some preface.

about 3 weeks ago my neighbor saw me dressed in all black leaving for work and he asked me, ""who died?"" i laughed. he laughed. we all had a good time. today—i'm heading to my car, and i see him and his wife dressed in all black so i obviously asked, ""who died?""
 
his wife breaks down and starts hardcore crying. turns out her mom had just died. she then proceeds to lecture me about making fun of death as she's still crying at a 6/10. her husband never said anything about the fact that he made the same joke 3 weeks ago, which is fine. i wouldn't have either. 

so now i'm gonna avoid her forever. i know it's not the craziest tifu, but now i'll respect death forever.

tl;dr i asked my neighbor ""who died?"" and it turns out someone had actually died. got a nice lecture on death.",4
"tifupdate by finding out i've been accidentally dating and fucking my half-sister, after taking a 23andme dna test update. link to my previous post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/af5h58/tifu_by_finding_out_ive_been_accidentally_dating/

same updated posted here(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am8cr1/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/) on r/23andme.

first things first, just wow. i can't thank you all enough for the support through the kind comments and messages. i wish i could reply to all of them, but there are just too many. 

i'll answer some common questions i received towards the end of the post, but i'll first start with where we left off. 

after a long dreadful night full of surprises, i woke up the next morning questioning everything. i called bullshit on the test and immediately called sarah. she picks up telling me she's already booked an appointment with a genetic counselor. good, we're both on the same page.  

the next day, we meet with the genetic counselor specifying in patients who take tests with commercial companies. tldr of what she said was, while the ancestry reports can be interpreted with a degree of skepticism, dna matches are determined directly through the raw dna data, meaning the connection is either there or it isn't. we asked if there was a possibility that we contaminated each other's samples. she said that our samples would have been flagged by the system (apparently that's easy to spot). even if our 'contaminated' samples magically made it through the system, we would have been shown to be sharing completely identical segments, while 23andme showed we only share half identical segments. 

it was basically confirmed by a specialist at this point and the same feeling of dread i had the other night began to set in again. my friend called an hour later, telling sarah and i to upload our raw data to a 3rd party dna site online, as extra confirmation. we did just that, and surprise surprise, we're shown as being half-siblings.

sarah and i spent the rest of the day calling both of our parents and explaining everything. we all came to the conclusion of sarah and i taking a weekend trip back home, to see how this all started. this idea came to me the same night when the whole ordeal began. 

ever since that night, sarah and i, understandably, haven't been the same. i've been trying to mentally cope with my emotions. the logic part of me is telling me ""incest bad, not right, break up"" while emotionally, i still love sarah. i'm having this constant battle in my head, and i'm sure sarah is too. all of this was especially apparent when friday rolled around. we both packed our bags and hopped into my car. during our entire drive up north towards home, not a single fucking word from the both of us. 5 hours later, we finally made it to sarah's house (the agreed meeting destination). right before we exit the car, my brain decides to short-circuit. i grab sarah's hand and lean into kiss her. she stops me, looks me in the eyes, and after brief pause while teary-eyed says ""no matter what the outcome of all this will be, i'll be leaving having gained a brother."" that shit hit me hard. we both hug each other and start crying. for the first time in nearly a week, i felt some kind of relief while simultaneously thinking ""wtf is going on"". sarah and i both being the emotional meat bags we are, stop hugging and head inside before one of us mentally breaks down (again). 

2 hours later my parents arrive, and we all sit down and formally meet for the first time. oh yeah, did i forget to mention how this is the first time both my parents and i are meeting sarah's family? imagine how fucking awkward that shit is. i'll spare you all the cringeful details of all of us trying to make the whole situation a 'normal conversation'. 

both of our mother's brought the sperm donor ids. for those of you who don't know what that is, when a woman has received a sperm donor sample from a cryo-bank, it comes with a id that is unique to that specific donor. our mother's compare the ids and... they're a match. sarah and i were conceived from the same donor (which we had already guessed to be the case).

the rest of the night was spent discussing what to do going on. as much as i still had feelings for her, sarah and i came to the conclusion of breaking up. we decided to go to a bi-weekly counseling therapist, to help us get past all this crap and transition into a sibling relationship. 

we spent the rest of our weekend catching up with our families and headed back to uni on monday. 

as of now, 12 days later, sarah and i are going to therapy together and we've maintained a friendly relationship, still keeping in touch throughout the week. mentally, we're both much better but still have a long way to go. it's to early to tell, but i have hope for the future.

q&a:

q: when were you both conceived?

a: we were both conceived a month apart, and born 5 weeks apart.


q: do you guys look alike?

a: no, not really. the only thing we 'have in common' are our somewhat similar noses. 


q: what were your ancestry results?

a: idk why this was a really common question i got through pm, but here you go(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am85w9/my_results/)


q: what town are you both from?

a: no


q: why do you both care? you should stay together.

a: there's no way that's happening in this society, nor do i want it to happen. we'd have to deal with social and even legal problems (depending on the state). also, we'd run the risk of conceiving a genetically unhealthy child if we chose to have kids. 


q: were you two able to find your biological father?

a: sarah and i didn't match closely (in terms of 1st cousins and up) with anyone else on 23andme, and as of now, we no longer have a desire to find our bio-father. the genetic counselor mentioned we should keep an eye out for any future half-siblings taking the test.

tldr: confirmed incest with specialist, went back home with ex-gf/half-sister, moms confirmed the same sperm sample. sarah and i have maintained a 'sibling-like' relationship and are currently in therapy.

"by going to the eiffel tower & getting my girlfriend and i tear-gassed, trampled, assaulted, and robbed. ^obligatory: ^this ^didn't ^happen ^today, ^but ^over ^the ^summer. ^also ^warning ^some ^nsfw ^language.

^tl;dr ^first ^because ^it's ^long: ^went ^to ^eiffel ^tower ^to ^watch ^euro ^2016 ^finals, ^ended ^up ^in ^a ^riot(http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/euro-2016-french-riot-police-fire-tear-gas-at-supporters-outside-paris-fan-zone-during-france-match-a7129906.html) ^because ^we ^ran ^late, ^got ^tear ^gassed, ^girlfriend ^dislocated ^knee, ^her ^phone ^stolen, ^my ^nose ^broken, ^and ^our ^passports ^stolen.

**background:** my girlfriend (who we'll call emily) and i were in paris on the very first day of a month long backpacking trip in europe. we spent the whole morning smoking hash at sacre-coeur with some new friends, who told us that the euro 2016 final between france and portugal was that night. they told us to meet them to watch the game at the 'fan zone' at the eiffel tower but urged us *not to be late,* otherwise we wouldn't get into the 'fan zone.' 

being jet-lagged and burnt out from the hash, we took a nap before heading down, but overslept by an hour. we figured we'd head down to the eiffel tower anyway and see what was going on. whoops.

**the fuck up:** arriving at the eiffel tower we realize there isn't any fanzone to be found, or so we think. it turns out we are in the completely wrong place(http://imgur.com/a/8pes8) on the opposite side of the tower from the fan zone, and amongst a crowd of mostly troublemakers that is about to erupt into a riot. 

the first signs of chaos are a small group of youths antagonizing police underneath the tower, and when we see a massive line of riot police facing in our general direction, we decide it's time to leave. 
as we make our way through the crowd i hear screaming and look up in horror to see a smoking projectile sailing through the sky, headed right for us. the crowd around us scatters, knocking emily and i down, where a **tear gas canister blows up mere feet from our faces**. 

""get up! we have to go!"" i'm screaming at emily but i notice she's crying & screaming out in pain, not from the tear gas in our eyes but from the fact that **her knee is so broken the thing might as well be on mars.** i throw her over my shoulder and go sprinting through clouds of tear gas out of the chaos and onto the pont d'iena bridge, where some guy **snatches emily's phone out of her hand**. i turn and watch helplessly as the guy runs off into the crowd, emily screaming ""he took my phone!"" 

""fuck the phone!"" i run as far as my arms/legs allow and then set her down. i need to get her to an ambulance, but i can't leave her to find one, so i need someone to help me. so i start screaming at the crowd around me for someone to help, forgetting that i am amongst almost nothing but riff-raff of the worst variety. nobody helps me or seems to give a shit, so i pick her up and run as far as i can and set her down again. a crowd gathers ogling my girlfriend's knee and staring at me blankly as i shout shit they don't understand like ""911! ambulance!"" 

it's then i am disgusted to notice a hand reaching from emily's purse to my back pocket, and i slap it away forcefully, standing up from a crouching position as i do so, screaming ""fuck out of here!"" i look into the eyes of the perpetrator, a young african guy who loads up and punches me in the face, **shattering my nose**. as blood spurts out of my nose i look at the guy and say with genuine bewilderment ""are you fucking kidding me?"" he looks at me blankly like he is genuinely surprised to see me still on my feet and spitting profanity at him. i scoop up my girlfriend and start running for our lives. 

i'm now running on what i am convinced is just an infinite bridge of hell on earth. brawls rage around us as my knees are starting to buckle, my vision blurring. i'm bleeding out of my head onto my girlfriend's lap who is screaming in agony from being carried around with a dislocated knee. i am pretty sure we are going to die. 

suddenly i'm joined by our savior, a very large goofy looking fellow, who begins helping me carry emily and encouraging us in french or some other language which we didn't speak. it occurs to me that he could be trying to steal from us too, but at this point i don't even care.  our new friend's intentions turn out to be true, as he and his group of friends helped me carry my girlfriend to relative safety and helped me guard her while they got help. (for a while i couldn't tell this part of the story without getting extremely emotional about this guy and his friends who stepped up to help us when everyone else was trying to take advantage of our situation. i'll never forget him.)

a bunch of paramedics pulled up in a station wagon, urging me to stay calm while they waited for an ambulance. as police pushed rioters further down the bridge in our direction, i begged the paramedics to just get us out of there in the car. with fear in their eyes and the situation escalating they finally relented, carefully placing emily in the backseat while i jumped in the trunk.

they got us to a safe part of the city and asked us for our id. it's then we realized that, as if we weren't having a bad day already, **our passports had been stolen.**

we ended up at a hospital outside paris, where they did a great job re-setting my girlfriend's knee and didn't touch my nose which was fine with me. it's still crooked. luckily we were able to get emergency passports and continue on the rest of our trip which was absolutely amazing. i still smell tear gas sometimes when i see  eiffel tower pictures & trinkets. good times!

tl;dr (again): was late to the eiffel tower to watch euro 2016 finals, ended up in a riot, got tear gassed, girlfriend's knee broken, her phone stolen, my nose broken, and our passports stolen.

**edit:** since people are pointing out how i mentioned that the guy who punched me was african, which was for the sole purpose of illustrating the scene, i'd like to add that my entire day in paris was spent hanging out with african guys who showed me more hospitality than i have found almost anywhere else in the world. i hung out with these guys that one day for like 6 hours, they talked to me a lot about just how poor and starving much of the african population in paris is. i harbored a lot of anger towards the guy that punched me for a while but i also understand the context of just how starving that guy probably was. people that are trying to politicize this, or turn it into some racist/anti-refugee talking point, or are leaving comments like ""those thugs should burn in hell"" should have a more nuanced perception of the world.

edit2: if the alt-right folks that are trying to make me their racist champion just because i called the guy african would fuck off, that would be great :)

"by encouraging female ejaculation nsfw. so i've been fooling around with this girl for awhile now and naturally we've cycled through all your standard vanilla kinks and things were starting to wind down a bit. this wasn't a big deal though as neither of us is interested in anything more than casual sex so there's no pressure to keep things fresh and exciting.

that being said, a little bit ago she randomly messaged me saying she has something naughty to share and sends me cellphone footage of her with a vibrator doing some impressive pornography-grade squirting. she goes on to talk about how excited she is for teaching herself how, and we proceed to make plans to explore this further. next thing i know she's cumming in my face like a chinese firefighter trying to extinguish a burning chemical factory while i'm right there dumping fuel on the flames.

now, before i get carried away here, i'll just say, i'm a m nurse by trade, and i have no delusions about what's really going on. i can tell exactly where her 'juices' are coming from, and i've made peace with the fact that the girl is pissing in my face while i go down on her, no big deal.

so finally, to the point. she's been squirting in my face for a few weeks now and i've gotten enough in my mouth to know how it tastes. the most surprising thing about the experience is the fact that her piss didn't taste at all like i'd thought it would. ranging from unflavored gatorade to that bland tea they serve you at oriental restaurants (that you dump sugar packets into). i thought it was a fluke at first, but after repeatedly testing this observation, i'm quite certain that her piss tastes sweet, sometimes blatantly so.

the perverted side of me thought all this was kinky as hell, so i really didn't think on it too much until this morning. i just woke up and had a weird nurse's epiphany about it. sweet urine. glucose urine. glycosuria. jesus christ. i'm a fucking dumbass. i race over to my bag where i keep my backup glucometer for work, wake her bleary-eyed ass up, and pricked her finger to check her blood sugar. 441. **fuck!** recheck. 453. **shit!!** asymptomatic, but hyperglycemic as fuck. she's got the beetus. diabetes. i broke the news as gently as i could, which was something to the tune of ""holy shit fuck! that's some serious fucking diabetes! call your doctor!"" hysterics ensued. so now she's out to the doctors office and possibly the urgent care clinic for treatment, and i'm sitting here trying figure out a good cover story for how i knew..

tldr; by breaking some bad news to a girl after she ""squirted"" in my face and i diagnosed her with diabetes after realizing her piss was unnaturally sweet.

---------------------------------

update: insert the obligatory ""omg this went supernova!!1"" .. on a serious note though, thanks for the reddit gold~~en shower~~. this has been a long day and i haven't felt this cool on the internet since that time i used a voice modulator in an mmorpg to convince my guild i was a black guy.

to bring things current, the girl is doing fine now, they've ran more thorough tests and strongly suspect she's a type 1 diabetic, but it'll take a few days and tests to confirm the preliminary results. she's got a lot on her mind, all i can think about though is how we went from casual fuck buddies to irreversibly connected by the act of getting her piss in my mouth.

still, the response has been hilariously fantastic. while there's a lot of contention on whether this is a fuck up, i'll just say that a couple factors had stuck out to me personally that framed it like that, such as the fact that it took weeks for me to piece this all together, my majorly panicked reaction to it, and the resulting state of hysteria i had caused after scaring the girl half to death. that all kind of overshadowed the lucky guess i made, in my mind anyway. no longer though! right now i feel like the fucking **man**, thanks for helping me see the cloud's golden lining!",4
"by drinking starbucks.. i'm currently in bed, huddled under the covers and riding out the shockwaves of trauma from this event. 

my first fuck-up was trying to cut out caffeine a few months ago. i succeeded, but also lost my tolerance for caffeine (was drinking an average of 8 espresso shots throughout the day). 

today, maybe two hours ago, i went to a doctors appointment. this appointment was in a huge hospital, one that had a food court and of course, a starbucks. it was a mental-health related program, so i was a bit on-edge afterwards. i saw the sign for starbucks and the clouds of depression began to life. oh hell yes, the sweet nectar of life beckons to me. 
i get in line and order a medium sized coffee, cream and sugar - something tame, i thought to myself. not tame enough apparently. 

i got in the car and started to drive home. about ten minutes away, i feel a bubbling in my gut. oh boy. it's fine, i say to myself, i can make it home without incident. oh, how wrong i was. 

while i had been focused on keeping my asshole clenched, i had forgotten that nearly every road and intersection on my way home was clogged up by construction. detours everywhere. every time i thought i was getting close to home, i was forced to backtrack and drive a few streets over. at this point, i'm sweating and shaking, my legs are essentially vibrating, and i have no idea how i haven't passed out at the wheel yet. 

and then it hits me. the cramps. i got my fucking period. in the car. 

any person with a uterus will tell you how bad cramps are until they are blue in the face. i will do the same, because when i ovulate, i get cysts all over my ovaries due to pcos (polycystic ovarian syndrome). needless to say, it makes everything way more awful than it needs to be. 

my abdomen tightens up, trying to force all of the coffee-afterbirth and uterine tissue out of me, but i resist. i will not shit my car, and i certainly will not bleed onto my seats. that shit isn't even paid off yet. 

i get re-routed for what feels like the millionth time, and finally i see it: a road to home with no construction. i step on the gas and swing around every corner with the gumption and moxie of an f1 driver. in doing this, i have fucked up again. 

i currently have an inner-ear infection, and in my haste i have shaken up all the liquid in my cochlea. vertigo. vertigo like you wouldn't believe. 

to recap: i'm holding in a torrent of liquid regret, clenching my pelvic floor muscles to keep as much of my uterus inside of me as possible, and now i'm dizzy enough that i could no longer tell if my eyes were crossed or not. 

i fly into my driveway, throw my car in park and yank my keys out. i run to my porcelain throne as fast as my entirely clenched body would allow me, all the while bumping into things in my way because the vertigo hadn't gone away yet and i was effectively as coordinated as a drunk person. 

when i say it was a photo finish, i'm not joking. i started shitting before my ass even hit the toilet (everything landed in the bowl tho, thankfully). i was sitting there for, legitimately, nearly 45 minutes. 100% liquid. and it didn't stop for more than three seconds at a time. once it was over i felt like i had run a marathon wearing lead boots. all of my energy was gone. i crawled upstairs on my hands and knees with the intent of getting in bed, but had to make a mad dash for the bathroom once again and do it all a second time. finally got myself in the shower to rinse off all of my sweat and potential residue of my poor choices... and then had to stop mid-shower for a third round of misery. i feel another round coming, so this is probably the end of my post. 

tl;dr - if you're drinking coffee and have to drive home immediately after, maybe shit before you leave the coffee shop.

edit: thank you for the gold, stranger!! i'm glad my story was deemed worthy!

edit 2: thank you for another gold and also platinum!! to answer some questions - yes i am staying hydrated. my mom bought me an absurd amount of gatorade once she learned of my rectal exorcism. i also did not expect this to gain any attention whatsoever but thank you for the upvotes and kind words :)

"by making my cousin agree to hooking up with me.  

this happened today morning and i am still thinking how to process it. this is gonna be a long rant.

i have another account that i use professionally so this is a throwaway.

going for a stressful period in life and so i often hang out with my cousin and we too are really close in a sibling way. so, coming to today i live in 2 rooms on the first floor - an old room where everything from my previous flat is stocked and is more of a store room and the other is where i work and live 24x7. i woke up early to try clean my old store room and was rummaging through some old dvds and stuff.also made double sure i had the condoms hidden away in a box and whilst doing so, a client who had been avoiding paying me called - i dropped everything and got into the call which ended with me throwing away my phone and the tempered glass cracks. no worries, i got another one- meanwhile cousin was laughing away hysterically at me. i was trying to get the new temper on and realized i need to wipe it, given how lazy i am i asked her to go get some wet wipes from the other room and told her which box had it. she went and disappeared for nearly half an hour. given, how absent minded she can be i did not think anything of it and kept the phone aside for now.

later, she comes to the room with a very serious look, somewhat teary eyes and asked me if i really wanted this ? i said ""yes, i have been waiting forever for this"" and i mimicked her serious tone just for kicks. next thing i know she has jumped on top of me and is kissing me - not the brotherly kiss btw and i sat there all frozen and for some reason i did not move a muscle to throw her off me. i just froze. she starts stripping and i said something like why/how...its a bit foggy there. she says see saw the strawberry condoms, the adele dvd and the old box had this pretty please designed on it. strawberry is her favourite and adele is her weakness. so, my poor cousin struggled with the moral dilemma for a good 30 minutes before coming to me to ask me and i stupidly said yes. i put the condoms instead of the wet wipes (both have some bluish covers) that stupid adele album is here favourite.

thankfully, before she could disrobe and this went any further, we heard my mother shouting from below that lunch is ready. i quickly made my exit without blinking for a second and had my lunch without choking myself. mom dragged my cousin to the market for some shopping and my cousin told me with great sadness in her voice ""i am there for you""

i am writing this now knowing i might have messed up my relationship with her forever.

i know i will tell her the truth when she comes back but such a series of coincidences is too hard to be believed

tl;dr : sent cousin to get wet wipes, had mixed up old stuff earlier, gave her all the signals that i wanted to hookup with her and she agreed. kill me now someone pls.",4
"by helping a friend. a friend knocked on my door today. i don't know him too well, he's the father of one of my son's friends. he seemed quite urgent, so i let him in. he asked if i had a scanner, as he needed something scanned and emailed to him straight away. i sure did!

i invited him into my office. placed the first page into the scanner. sat down. opened my graphics software, and declared ""it's easy! watch!"".

unfortunately the software displayed the last image i was working on; a close-up of my erect penis.

it was a decent photo actually. great lighting. good composition. a nice angle, too! i don't have many of those pics, i just took one recently as someone asked for it, and uncharacteristically, i felt like obliging.

two thoughts went through my head;

1. close it (which i did)
2. will he think i've been checking out dick pics, and that i'm gay?!

now, #2 is not an issue. i am not, and i don't care if anyone thinks i am. however... recently he's been inviting me to a lot of kids' events, and asking questions like ""are you dating?"", ""what do you think of helen?"" (name changed for privacy reasons). so i've been wondering if he is that way inclined, and perhaps had his eyes on me....

so... i then compounded things.

to stop him thinking that i'd been looking a close-up pics of other men's penises.. i confidently said ""that was me!"".

he looked around, said ""i think someone called me"", and left.

&#x200b;

edit: there have been a lot of questions! so here are some clarifications;

1. i didn't scan my penis. i scanned his paper documents.
2. i took the photo of myself with a dslr+tripod
3. the photo editing i did on the photo of myself was limited to cropping (removing background stuff) and resizing the image itself (from \~4000px to \~2000px).
4. all 3 people mentioned in this story are single. we all live in the same townhouse complex.
5. the software i use (paint.net) is used both for the editing (cropping, resize) and for acquiring images from my flatbad scanner
6. no, unless we have a pre-existing relationship, you can't see the photo. thanks for asking, though!
7. this happened at my home office. 

tl;dr accidentally showed a neighbour a close-up photo of my erect penis, then proudly said ""that was me!""",4
"by accusing my son of having an eating disorder.. so, i like to think i'm an o.k mom. i don't smother my son or let him get too crazy. he's fifteen so i always knock on the door, not just to be respectful, but because there's some things a mom shouldn't see.

well, yesterday he left to go to the mcdonald's across the street with some friends. i assumed he'd be a couple hours so as far as i knew i was alone. i decided to take advantage by putting on some headphones that wouldn't be inevitably tugged on with a ""mom, can-"" question following.

i'm doing the dishes, sweeping, trash, etc while metallica is blasting in my ears. i start gathering laundry/putting it away, and unbeknownst to me my son got home earlier than expected.

i decided to toss his gym clothes i just finished washing on his bed while i was putting away my own clothes as our rooms are right next to each other. i did not know he was home. i walk straight in without knocking and i'm horrified.

my 15 y/o son is...shoving a spoon down his throat and gagging over a cereal bowl. what the fuck.

he instantly jumps, slowly turns over to me, and the spoon almost comically drops from his mouth. i set the clothes down and in my confusion/horror sit down next to him.

i asked ""what were you doing?"" and he's extremely nervous and keeps repeating ""it's nothing i wasn't doing anything.""

he's on the wrestling team and it clicked in my head *oh shit he was making himself throw up he must be body conscious how did i not notice he was doing this to himself*. 

i start giving a mom speech about how body dysphoria is extremely common in teens and he shouldn't be afraid to ask for help from a trusted adult, that i'm here for him, he's perfect just the way he is. 

he looks like a deer caught in the headlights and remains adamant he wasn't doing anything. i asked ""is this something you'd rather talk about with (uncle) or (coach)?"" he's exasperated and tense saying there's nothing to talk about.

finally i just have to say ""it's pretty obvious what you were doing and i need you to be honest with me or someone else so we can figure this out.""

him: ""i wasn't trying to throw up!""

me: ""then what were you doing?""

him: ""i needed to know if i have a gag reflex!""

i'm extremely confused at this point and ask why. he blurts, ""i'm gay!"" i'm completely shocked and he has tears in his eyes.

it clicks.

i immediately wish i hadn't done laundry that day and give a quick ""i'm sorry, it's okay, i support you completely, i'll just...leave you to that"" and continue doing chores.

dinner rolls around and he's refusing to make eye contact but eventually we ease into a conversation about how he's been hiding it for awhile, has a lot of homophobic friends and was ashamed to tell me because ""i'm your only son so you wouldn't have grandkids"". he planned to come out in college. i had no idea he thought i'd react that way and assured him i'd love him no matter what.

apparently he's also not planning on...doing anything he'd need to practice with a spoon for in the near future...but was just curious and wanted to be ready. i'm relieved but mostly want to forget i ever saw that. at least it brought us closer.


tl;dr walked in on son gagging himself with a spoon. thought it was bulimia. turns out hes just gay.",4
"by eating oreos and making my mom think she was going crazy.. this happened around 2010 when i was roughly 24 years old. i still lived at home with my mom who always had a sweet tooth. now, by this time she was suffering from some early onset dementia and did not work, so she had a lot of time on her hands. she liked to call customer service numbers and give them a hard time about little things for some human interaction, in my opinion. she had been calling nabisco several times about her opening brand new oreo packages and finding the center row of the tray  almost completely devoid of oreos. i knew this because she had mentioned it and would leave notes from her phone calls around. i rolled my eyes as i was used to her being a little nutty. according to her, it kept happening and she began taking photos of the oreos each time it happened to try to prove to nabisco that she wasn't making this up. i assumed she was eating them and forgetting.  one day, i'm in the kitchen and i open up a brand new package of oreos and grab several from the center row.  as i start walking away, it hit finally hit me! she didn't realize that oreo had updated their packaging to having the easy open pull tab on the top! she was still opening the side of the package and sliding the tray out. i was the oreo thief the whole time and didn't know it! we had a good laugh over it. my mom died shortly thereafter in january 2012 and my sister bought me an oreo christmas ornament. i smile as i recall the oreo incident when i decorate my tree each year. 

tl;dr - i was using the new easy open pull tab on the top of oreo packages while my mom was still opening the package from the side and sliding the tray out which led to her thinking nabisco was shorting us oreos.",4
"by quoting a kid's movie at the end of sex.. this happened around 5 years ago when i was still in university. 

i was not the most forthcoming 5 years ago, i didn't know how to 'be' around women, let alone, god forbid, have sex with said women. 

as surprising as it may seem then, i was going through quite the 'dry spell' that year, and had resigned myself to studying instead and little else. 

however, as with all things in life, the moment you stop you looking is the moment you find it. 

i found myself back at this girl's house who was studying in the uk for that year. she was from slovenia (somewhat unimportant detail other than those brits who voted 'leave' and now see me as part of the eu problem somehow) and absolutely gorgeous. i was punching way, way above my weight and thought i should relish every one of the seconds i knew i was going to enjoy with this girl. 

again, unsurprisingly, i did not quite go the distance. i was however, in a state of absolute delirium - that post-orgasm 'fuzz' where everything in the world seems grand, and nothing could take that away.

apart from me, of course. 

she, rightly so, tried to, y'know, get me going again, for my first attempt was so poor. 

however, in my state of delirium, and ultimately recovery, i was in no fit state to do so just yet. 

as she goes to sit atop of me, my brain goes into a strange autopilot. 

i gently push her to the side to stop her sitting down on me. ok, that's bad enough, but it didn't stop there.

i, for entirely unknown reasons say the words 'that'll do pig, that'll do'. in exactly the same way as that immortal final line from the kid's movie called 'babe' (about a pig, funnily enough). 

as it transpires, this movie was not a hit in slovenia, and no amount of me pleading 'it's a kid's movie' at her seemed to help as she slowly got dressed and opened the door for me. 

tldr: ended a dry spell with a knockout girl, refused round two by calling her a farmyard animal.

edit 1 - thanks for the gold. you've taken my gold virginity, in fact. that'll do, pig, that'll do. 

edit 2 - to all those all knowing sex gods on reddit telling me that sex doesn't end at the male orgasm. yeah, thanks guys, i know. i was in a state of bewilderment. i just needed a moment. i had plans. but then i fucked up. hence why it's here on tifu. who woulda thought it or thunk it?",4
"by asking siri to play me a song and making her worry about my mental health. i was using a bluetooth adapter in my car to be safe and not use my phone while driving. i asked siri to play a song called ""make me wanna die"" and to my surprise, instead of playing the song she said something along the lines of "" if you're feeling depressed the suicide hotline can help you, would you like me to call?"" i screamed "" no do not do that"" soooo of course she did anyway. i didn't want to hang up because idk what happens if you hang up on the suicide hotline? so some lady who had much more important stuff to do answered and i low key yelled ""imfinesirigotconfusedimsosorry"" based on her reaction it wasn't he first time it'd happened but i was still totally mortified.

"by reading a reddit post and learning that i am not normal.. so today i woke up at 5 a.m. (about an hour ago). i open reddit before i start getting ready for work. i notice a post.

as i'm reading through the post and comments, i realize that have never been able to visualize something or someone. i only see black.  i did not realize that this is not normal. apparently it's called aphantasia and it's relatively rare. most people see clear images and colors when they're visualizing something. i'm 22 and did not know this was a thing until i read that post.  i've been trying to test myself for the last hour to see if i can ""picture"" anything. turns out i can't. so now i'm sitting here having an existential crisis about all the things i'll never be able to ""see"" again.  

tl;dr i read a reddit post and discovered i have aphantasia.


edit: a lot of people are asking if i can dream or not.  the answer is sort of.  i do have dreams occasionally and supplements (melatonin/other sleep pills) sometimes make them more vivid, but i don't recall them at all. the only time i know i have dreamt is when it's a shocking/scary/exciting dream. i feel something after i wake up, i just can't recall a damn thing that happened. sometimes i can remember the premise of the dream, like if it was me working or traveling somewhere, just can't ""see"" what i saw when i dreamt.  i think i dream maybe once or twice a month.

edit 2:  i understand the difference between visualizing and actually seeing something. *seeing* is just the best word i have to describe what i can't do in my head.  from memory, i can tell you what something looks like. i just can't *see* it in my minds eye.   

while reading a book, the descriptions do nothing for me.  i read for the plot.",4
"by taking my bird for a walk and accidentally looking like a pedophile. my husband and i adopted my parent's parrot this spring after my dad passed away and my mom moved into assisted living. we got a backpack carrier for him last month so we can visit and my mom can still see him (the parrot, not my dad).

since we have the backpack, we decided to take him for nature walks instead of always keeping him in the house. for now we're putting the backpack in a baby stroller so it's less of a jarring bumpy ride until he gets used to standing on a moving perch. it's got screen mesh on three sides so he can see out, but it's a little hard to see into his pack from more than a foot or two away. it just looks like we're pushing a stroller with a large backpack in it.

so yesterday we went on our first walk in a local park. the bird's quiet, or calmly chirping, or occasionally saying ""hello, youuuuuuu"" and we respond back in kind, a call and response thing he likes.

the park's mostly deserted - until the local high school track team runs by for their after-school practice run through the park. a bunch of teenage boys, shirtless. and one lags behind. as the lone boy, maybe 15 years old, runs past us, the bird calls out the loudest wolf whistle ever. and my husband and i burst out laughing, as the boy runs away from us faster.

an open letter of apology to the track coach and team at stevenson high,

yesterday i went for a walk in the woods at dodge park when members of what i believe were your track team went running by me. one of the team members was lagging behind, and i inappropriately chose that moment to let out the loudest wolf whistle possible.

at the time i was sitting in my backpack carrier in a stroller, being pushed by my owners. they broke out in loud laughter. the person i whistled at probably didn't see me and thought my owners whistled at me to sexually harass me, and then were laughing loudly about it because they were jerks. that's not what happened, and while they didn't need to laugh, the whole incident was entirely my fault. i was acting inappropriately.

sincerely,

bongo, a poorly behaved parrot who needs to learn boundaries.

"by using my roommate's ""toy"" nsfw. my roommate and i are pretty close and have an open policy about going into each others' ""bedside drawers"" (need condoms, lube, etc.) as far as i know, neither of us has used this liberty until now. my roommate is out of town for a few weeks for a marathon and vacation and i am kind of lazy when it comes to certain things. 

due to improper planning, i ran out of personal lubricant so i took a visit to my roommate's drawer to see if he had some. he did, as well as some other things. one of those things was what i can only describe as a triple cock-ring (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/3178jrk6a1l._sy355_.jpg) contraption.
for context, my roommate is a 6'2 black guy and i'm a 5'10 ginger. naturally, i assumed that, if anything, this device would be too big for me. i was woefully wrong.

i was in the mood so i didn't think through the possible consequences of placing my most precious parts in this stainless steel death trap. almost immediately after wriggling my naughty bits into this thing, i realized my horrible mistake. 

within 30 seconds, my twig and berries transformed into a grotesque set of eggplant and plums. as with any bad situation, i figured my best way out was to power through. i took the aforementioned lube and went to town.

after what felt like a lifetime, i began to approach climax. for my trouble, i was hoping for an intensely pleasurable orgasm. again, i was wrong. 

instead of a powerful release, i was met with an intense pain in my perineum and nothing came out. this thing was so tight that there was no ejaculate. i freaked out.

i figured once i got this nonsense torture device off my situation, things would resolve themselves but again, i was wrong.

the caricature emoji that was my junk, remained fully engorged.
i continued to freak out. i didn't want to go to the er and have some firefighter saw this horrifying mistake off my adult parts, so i did the next logical thing. 

i filled a bowl with ice and water, dunked my bits and hoped for salvation. after 15 minutes, the swelling subsided to the point that i could manipulate the affected area out of the contraption.
after another 20 minutes of icing my genitals, i went to relieve myself and proceeded to pass, what i assumed to be, a frothy mixture of man milk and urine.

2/10 do not try.

"by taking amphetamines and subsequently masturbating my limp penis for 6 hours. nsfw. brief summary:

i was recently prescribed an amphetamine medication. i took some and expected the typical described results. what i did not expect was to experience a sharply increased sex drive coupled with an unfortunate effect of impotence - however this would not deter me from my goal of achieving sweet release. i was on a mission to give my brain what it wanted, apparently at any cost, and my rocksteady mental fortitude was nothing short of a fully loaded freight train without brakes.  

ten minutes of sweet loving turned into half an hour in the blink of an eye. confused, yet dedicated, i proceeded onward. the next glance at the clock revealed that three hours had gone by. ""how could this be happening?"", i thought, but i was far too invested at this point to give up. the next three hours went by as quickly and autonomously as the last, but after a total of six hours, the deed was done, and the ensuing moment of clarity was a grim moment indeed as i considered the consequences of my actions.  

my little man has receded mostly into my body and is now simply a swollen nub which stands stoutly as a monument to man's arrogance. also, the entire member feels harshly chafed and my entire pelvic region is sore. i'm not looking forward to the next 24 hours.  

**aftermath: warning nsfw(no blood)**

album of what once resembled a fairly normal penis.(http://imgur.com/a/msz2i)

i'm anticipating a few questions so i will address them here:

* were you ever erect?
     * i achieved at most half-chub intermittently for less than 50% of the entire session.
* did you finish? 
     * yes
* was it worth it?
     * absolutely not
* did you use any lube?
     * no
* does it hurt?
     * terribly
* why did you do it?
     * because apparently i have no self respect.

so like every other post this didn't happen today and this story will be kept as vague as possible while still telling the story because i don't want people to find out who i am lol..

in order to understand why this all happened i have to explain that i was in high school and was dating a girl we will call samantha, well when i started dating samantha i was friends with her sister joselyn beforehand and it turns out that joselyn had a thing for me that i was oblivious to. anyways i thought she had gotten over it as me and samantha had been dating for over 2 years already and there never seemed to be any sort of bad blood between the three of us. this is where the fuck up happened.. one day in school my girlfriend and i decided to skip class and were walking in the halls when we saw that a teacher had left their room open (without going too much into detail this teacher had the biggest room due to the type of class they taught.) so we decided to go in there to skip class and being horny teenagers we started doing more than just talking and hanging out... after that samantha decides to tell joselyn what we did because it was super crazy and full of adrenaline... this is how i found out that joselyn was still holding resentment after all this time. she told her parents about what samantha and i did in that classroom and her parents called the school which lead to an investigation on the teacher to see if he was leaving his door unlocked on purpose to allow the students to go in there and do as they please, the whole investigation put a strain on an already weak marriage the teacher was in which lead to a divorce and the teacher was found ""at fault"" for not locking his door and condoning this behavior so he was forced to resign and basically the teacher wont be allowed to teach again in our district.. the teacher is now working at a local grocery store baking cookies and basically i will always remember this shit as i feel awful and dont know what to do or fix it.

tl;dr - had sex in a teachers classroom which lead to the teacher having a divorce, and being forced to resign.

"by jacking off to my mom. throwaway for obvious reasons.

holy fuck i can't believe i'm writing this.

to give you some context, my mom used to be an adult actress. she has been pretty open about it in the past, and my family doesn't really judge her for it. she stopped about 5 years ago after she got pregnant with my sister and hasn't looked back.

today i was doing the five knuckle shuffle to one of those compilations (i don't want to be judged, so i won't say any more). you can probably see where this is going. just as i was about to bust a nut, it cut to an old video of my mom. i could definitely tell it was her because she looked directly at the camera for a second, but the machine was already in motion. i tried everything i could but it was too late.

later on i went downstairs to watch tv and i couldn't even look at my mom. this is definitely gonna be an awkward few months. one thing's for sure, from now on i think i'll just use my imagination.

tl;dr i accidentally ejaculated to an old clip of my mom when she used to do porn. now i can't even look at her.",4
"by hugging my friend's sister!. i feel so embarrassed even typing about this even though this happened like an hour ago. i still can't believe i can be this stupid. me and my friend had  decided that we would meet at a certain point so that we could go have lunch to a place which was close to that point. he told me that even his sister would come along with him. and i was fine with it.

note: the problem was that i couldn't seem to remember how she looks because i rarely see her as she stays away from the family.

so back to the present, after sometime i hear someone say hi and i turn back to see who it was. it was my friend's sister who was walking towards me with her arms outstretched. i commit to the hug because if i didn't it would get awkward. so i hug her and it seemed she really wasn't into it. so i step back from her and check what's wrong.

now i realize i did two mistakes. 1. she wasn't my friend's sister. because my friend was exactly behind her and with him was a girl. and she was already laughing about it. 2. she actually wanted to hug a person who was behind me and that's why she extended her arms.

after that they were kinda shocked, i couldn't really tell what their emotions were because i just walked away.

after that embarrassment i hugged my friend and ' his sister '. and they mocked me until our lunch got over.

tl;dr : basically hugged someone else thinking it was my friend's sister.


edit : after seeing the reaction maybe this was not as embarrassing as i thought it would be.",4
"by drinking a 35 year old can of coke.. this story actually took place around this time last year, but because it's embarrassing nature, my coworkers haven't stopped reminding me about it. 

our office does a small secret santa goft exchange every year, that we typically arrange in november, and give out gifts in december. you write your name on a slip of paper, along with some gift ideas, and whoever gets your name generally gets you some kind of gift, without you knowing who got it for you. the budget for these gifts is $20, so it's not like anyone is getting something super fancy.

now, generally speaking, i'm pretty indecisive. ask me what i want for christmas, i'll probably say i don't know. ask me what i want within a $20 budget? i definitely have no idea. i remember writing on the slip ""idk, something cool?"" beneath my name, expecting to maybe get a gift card or something generic. 

when i get to my desk on the day of gift exchange, i see a can of coke with an image of santa on the can, sitting beside a card. i remember thinking to myself ""well, this is what i get for not being specific. may as well be appreciative of what i've been given."" 

i open up the card, which contains an cheesy line, fitting of the sense of humor of the people in my office. ""if you put me in the fridge, i make a ""cool"" gift!"" my eyes scan down the card, and i read the next line. ""p.s. i'm almost twice your age!"" now, this should have been my first clue. however, being the youngest person at my office (i'm 20), i took this line to be a clue as to who my secret santa was! after all, half the fun was trying to figure out who got you the gift. never in a million years would i have thought that line, was to be taken from the perspective of the can. 

so, i crack open the can. as i go to take a sip, i notice the metal on the outside smells off. i'm not sure how to describe the smell, aside from how one might imagine an old garage would smell. this should have been my second clue, but instead i picture someone keeping their soda in a second fridge in their garage, something i had known many of my friend's fathers to do. of course, these were sodas we weren't allowed to drink, so i rationalize to myself that this particular can perhaps sat in a fridge in someone's garage long enough to soak of some of the, erm, garage smell? after a moment of hesitance, i remember once more that i should be appreciative of the gift, and take a sip. 

now, it feels important to note here, that i don't really drink coke. if anything, i drink pepsi, but i'm not really the biggest fan of dark sodas. i'm generally a sprite or even mountain dew kind of guy. the first sip, as far as i'm concerned, didn't really set off any alarm bells. maybe i was just in denial, but it wasnt until a few sips in that i truly became aware the soda was... off. i think to myself that it's the odd garage smell of the can that's got the soda tasting strange, as smell is a big part of taste, right? so, deciding i don't want to offend whoever it was that gave me the gift, i chug down the rest of the can as quickly as possible. 

now, it isn't until about an hour later that one of my supervisors approaches me, presumably for something unrelated, and looks in absolute horror at the can on my desk. i'm confused of course, until they explain that they collect coke memorabilia, including some of the older unopened cans with specific designs. they point out the ps on the card that was, apparently meant to indicate the age of the can and not the age of the person... i try to laugh it off, but, the judgement in the eyes of my supervisor is clear. after googling around, i managed to find the exact santa can. if i recall correctly, it had been about 35 years old, give or take a year.

the bright side is, surprisingly, the soda didn't make me sick at all. the downside is, even a year after the fact, i have yet to live this down. everyone in the office knows i drank this ancient soda, and even our new hires are quickly filled in. i wouldn't say it's what i'm known for at the office, but it's definitely still present in the minds of my coworkers!

tldr; someone gave me a collectible can of coke for secret santa, and not wanting to be impolite at the odd gift of a soda, i drank it.",4
"by adding my colleagues breast milk to my coffee.. this happened about 45min ago. some background info: my colleague, let's call her karen, just got back from mat leave and apparently has been proactively emptying her jugs at lunch time using a breast pump.

so about an hour ago, i started fixing up my daily post-lunch cup of joe when i opened the staff fridge. to my horror there was no more dairy (typically myself and another colleague take turns  supplying cream/milk for the entire office because we're the heavy coffee drinkers). after shuffling around food for 30seconds or so, on the back shelf, i saw a bottle (not quite a baby bottle) filled with some kind of milk. now i wasnt about to drink my coffee black like some kind of psychopath, so without any hesitation, i grabbed the bottle and loaded my coffee up. despite the coffee tasting a hint more sweet, i thought nothing of it.

15min later, cue karen going into the fridge and noticing her bottle has moved. not just that, her superhuman attention to detail has noticed the bottle isnt as full as before and proceeds to go on a witch hunt around the office, yelling ""who the fuck drank my breast milk???"".

tl;dr unknowingly added my colleagues breast milk to my afternoon cup of joe and am now hiding in shame as my colleague is on a witch hunt to find the culprit.

edit: a word
edit2: thank you to whomever took my gold and silver virginity! thank you kindly to those who didn't rip me apart! and for those that did... i hope you have a friggen amazing day!

update: holy shit this blew up. i'd just like to take a moment to defend myself a little. 1) we have a office rule of unless you label your food, its communal. i didnt think an unlabeled bottle of milk would be breast milk, this leads me to my second point... 2) i have another colleague who occasionally brings milk from home in a water bottle, so i didnt really think much of it. and 3) i've seen breast milk bottles before, this one was a little taller and didnt have any super apparent volume markings on the side so i didnt second guess anything (i'm 26m, not like i see a lot of breast feeding women/bottles anyway).

after reading how hard it can be to produce breast milk, i feel like absolute shit. ",4
"by letting my boyfriend pull out. this is a throwaway for obvious reasons, even though this story takes place almost 15 years ago. 

i was new to having sexual relations with boys, as previously it was only ever my girlfriends who i explored with sexually before boys. so i didn't have a whole lot to go on as i didn't have regular internet access to view porn or search sexual questions. 

so anyway, my boyfriend and i are getting busy in his basement bedroom. i'm smart enough to be on the pill, and also we had both just gotten tested for stds before starting to go further in our relationship. because of these clean tests we decide to bareback the sexy times and he opt to pull out as well, just in case.

he aims and blows his load on my stomach. except we can't find it to clean it up.  we looked everywhere and could not find his little splat of spunk. then we hear the front door unlock and open and the sound of his younger siblings and parents. we quickly get dressed, i spray myself with body spray (good old calgon) and head upstairs to pretend like we didn't just bang. 

i've only met his parents a couple times, and they are pretty easy going, especially as they let us sleep over in the same room. i have an uncommon female name and i'm often misnamed. so she reaches in for a hug and doesn't bother with my name, and then points out that i have a wet spot on my t-shirt. 

i have always had large enough breasts that i cannot see my tummy by just looking down. i have to lift my shirt. well stupid me forgets the fiasco moments ago and i lift my shirt slightly to investigate this wet spot. shining in the afternoon sun, is a long snot like string of jizz attached to my shirt from within my belly button.  his mum gives me this look and says i must have dropped my hair product or something and leaves it at that. i think i've gotten away with it. 

after dinner sometime as we are putting away dishes, she takes me aside and hands me a wad of condoms. not a word is said, just a handful of condoms. 

now i occasionally see her walking in the mall and make awkward eye contact with her and she gives a weird smile. i know the only thing she thinks when she sees me is ""bellybutton full of cum""


tldr: boyfriend pulled out and lost his load somewhere, but don't worry, his mum found it for me. 

edit: front page and rip inbox. i just woke up so i'll find a ruler for the belly button picture.

"by accidentally emailing everybody in my dept a chapter of my pornographic harry potter fanfiction.. this happened 2 hours ago.

i was emailing a .txt containing the latest installment of my fanfiction to myself because i'd written it on my laptop and i wanted to edit it on my desktop.

but i typed in my work email by accident. it's extremely similar to my personal email, but my work email automatically forwards every incoming message to everyone in my department. didn't even think about it.

i've never actually gotten physically sick because of a mistake before. the panic has died down a little. i've begun to accept that this is my life now.

it's not even tame porn you guys.

i'm going to resign tomorrow, early in the morning, by means of a letter; leave my keys to the building in the envelope; and go back to get a different degree. i've been thinking about doing it for a while. guess i don't really have a choice now.

**tl;dr:** sent a chapter of my harry potter porn to my coworkers earlier today. going to resign in disgrace tomorrow.

---

**edit:** thank you guys for all the advice and reassurance you've offered. you have no idea how much i needed it. i feel a little more human now, but this thread has gotten away from me. 

i still plan on resigning. i liked my job, but my boss will hear about this one way or another and as much as i appreciate all of the lies you've suggested, i honestly can't lie to her. i'm a shitty shitty liar and she's a very sharp woman. i won't get fired, she'd never pay unemployment as long as she lived, but i can't hope to move up in this particular company after something like this, and my life could get very difficult where i'm at.

i intend to go back to school. it's what i've been wanting to do for a long time, but i never had the courage to move forward with it. fortunately the nearby college has a good nursing program and i'm taking steps to register for fall.

now if you'll excuse me i'm going to go lie in bed and stare at the ceiling.

---

**last edit:** i know there might be at most 3 people who see this but i felt the need to update. it's very anticlimactic.

i calmed down before going into work monday and decided not to resign right off the bat. i just walked in like everything was normal and tried not to look at anyone. i sent out an email stating that my personal account had been compromised, and to please delete any messages from my personal account, as they may contain viruses. i felt like a dumbass trying to lie, but nobody approached me or acted strangely all day. my boss didn't even speak to me.

these last few days have been the same. maybe they read it, maybe they didn't, i have no clue. my guess is ""no"" but that might just be wishful thinking. either way, my life is going on somehow - but i'm definitely never going to email myself porn again.

and for those of you who were curious, it was a hg x lm fic set 5 years after the last book, so no, there was no cp or any other kind of nonsense going on, just regular ol sex between adults, although one is much older than the other. so don't worry. the children are safe.",4
"by detoxing myself and it nearly cost me my life. obligatory this happened 2 weeks ago

&#x200b;

i had been dieseling through a handle of cheap vodka every other day for over a year. i've never been much of a drinker, but several traumatic events had transpired in a very short amount of time, so i began drinking more to help me cope. i would never consider drinking during the day or before work, but it helped me get through the day. mixed drinks slowly gave way to straight shots of vodka. i would wake up at 7 am, feed the cat and take several shots. this continued well into the evening until i passed out on the couch or my bed. i started working at a local department store and the schedule was perfect as i didn't have to be in till1pm so i could wake up early, take several shots and sleep on the couch till noon then get ready for work; taking a couple of swigs on my way out the door. i'd get home around 10 pm and drink until i passed out.

this past february is when the shakes started, usually near the end of my shift. i'd get home, have a few shots and everything would be fine. what was disturbing was my memory loss. i was repeating stories, unsure of what day is was and i even forgot to pick up my nephew from school. dusk and dawn were the worst, it took me a few minutes to figure out if was day or night. i knew something had to change. two saturdays ago i bought a handle in the afternoon and it was gone by sunday evening. i woke up monday morning feeling awful. i was shaking, queasy and terribly off balance, but i didn't drink. by the afternoon i was feeling better and i figured i would get through this. i went to visit my sister and was having a glass of wine and a cigarette out on her back porch when i began to vomit all over her back deck. it was then that the shakes returned with a vengeance.

i went home and crashed on the couch. i woke up around 5 am and spent 20 minutes dry-heaving in the bathroom. i tried drinking water, but my hands were shaking so bad that it took both of them to steady the glass. i went back to the couch and drifted in and out of sleep for the majority of the morning. sometime after noon, i went to get my cat some water, but my hand began to convulse uncontrollably. i tried to steady it with my other hand, but i spilled water everywhere; that was the last thing i remembered. i was laying on my stomach on the living room floor when i noticed a police officer standing over me. i had no idea where i was or what had happened. i tried to get to my feet but collapsed onto the couch. my coffee table had been completely turned upside down and its contents were strewn all about the room. my mouth was in so much pain and i saw chunks of blood on the floor where i had been laying. the officer helped me get my shoes and coat on and assisted me out into the hall.

there were 2 more officers waiting outside and the helped me down the stairs to an ambulance. the paramedics were asking me questions, but i couldn't answer their questions. once in the emergency room, the doctors and nurses bombarded me with questions that i could barely answer. my main concern was the throbbing inside my mouth. one of the nurses explained to me that i had chewed off part of my tongue as that was one of the effects of having a seizure. i was admitted later in the evening and that was my sister and nephew came to see me. i could tell by the look in her eyes i was in very bad shape.

i was hooked up to several different machines with iv tubes in both arms and a blood pressure cuff that sat snuggly on my left bicep that inflated every 15 minutes; i was on the brink of complete coronary failure. over the next 3 days and nights i was a prisoner to my bed. there were sensors that would trigger an alarm if my legs went to far over the bed, if i tried to sit up it would set them off as well. if had to pee, they brought me a plastic jug and i had piss in the bed with an audience. every 30 minutes the blood pressure guff would inflate and take a reading followed by a nurse coming in and injecting medicine into my ivs. the worst part was i couldn't eat and barely drink because of the pain in my tongue. my speech was incomprehensible as my tongue was so swollen. everyday my sister came to visit and told me she had gone to my apartment to check on my cat and make sure everything was locked up; she even cleaned up the chunks of tongue off the floor.

by friday afternoon i was stable enough to go home, but with strict limitations. no driving, no strenuous tasks and lots of medication. this past friday i finally started eating solid food again; after 2 weeks of pureed food it was like heaven to eat a chicken salad sandwich. everyday i get a little stronger and feel a lot better. i still have trouble with my memory, but i think its good that i don't remember too much about the last year. i spoke to my neighbor; the one who called 911. he told me he had heard me fall and came banging on my door. when i didn't answer he went around to my back door and saw me laying on the floor. he said i looked at him and my face was covered in blood, that was when he called 911. i gave him a hug and he checks in on me daily. my tongue will never heal, but it's a small price to pay to remind me never do that again.

&#x200b;

tl;dr by attempting to detox, i suffered a seizure and chewed through my tongue. if my neighbor hadn't been home to hear me fall, i would've died.

"by taking ambien and accidentally proposing to my girlfriend. i want to start off with saying that ambien is the strongest drug/hallucinogen i've ever tried and you should not fuck with it.

anyways, one night i just couldnt sleep, so i decided to take 4 10mg ambiens (im an idiot) and i had an engagement ring in my drawer than i traded for some other jewelery because i buy and sell stuff on craigslist. anyways, long story short i woke up and she was wearing the ring on her finger and had explained what had happened and i was just shook because i couldnt remember shit. i go on my facebook and apparently my ambien drugged brain changed my relationship status to engaged and it got 150+likes before i fuckin saw it. i had not planned on being engaged with my girlfriend for another year and a half and probably wouldve gotten her a better ring but ambien sped up the process ten folds.

warning: if its 3am, and you can't sleep ,do not take ambien.

"by instinctively making a joke in physics class. normal physics class and just after our trials examinations. we were all trying to discuss our papers in the class while the lecturer was explaining to the few who personally asked her at the front desk. we had the choice to listen to her explanations or do our own studies to prepare ourselves for as examinations. i was too focused on my own mistakes, the first few parts of the papers.

after some time, she was explaining a question which got the majority of the class. it was a cupboard supported by a nail which is against a wall. the following question was ""how much weight can the cupboard support before it falls?"" it was a multiple choice question with the answers being something around 12kg, 22kg, 220kg and 2200kg. it was 220kg.

my friend was really bugged about it and proceeded to rant to me about it. keep in mind, i was not paying attention at all towards her or the question as i was a dumb idiot trying to understand simple questions.

friend: this doesn't make any sense. from my point of view, a cupboard can't hold that much.

me: it's physics, what else do you expect.

friend: a nail can't withstand that much weight.

me: it kind of did for jesus.

i felt a slight tap and saw my friend pointing to the front. only after i saw my lecturer's face, i realised what i said. my lecturer was in a serious mood during these past couple of weeks as our examinations were coming soon. also, she is a pious christian. on the bright side, the weather outside the classroom was lovely.

"by exposing myself to my wife's friend. this happened on friday, and i'm just now able to relive it without experiencing tourette-like outbursts of random noises and profanity from my extreme discomfort from the embarrassment.

i'm sitting on the toilet in the downstairs bathroom (which is right by the front door of our house), i have the door mostly closed, but it's not latched. doorbell rings, my wife answers it, it's her friend jen. jen comes in the house. i should mention that jen is a friend/neighbor we've known for just under a year and i don't really know her that well, which, for me, makes this worse.

i'm just finishing up, getting ready to wipe. i pull on the first piece of toilet paper, and as the toilet paper unrolls this big, and very fast spider comes running from behind the roll, brushing against my hand. instinctively, i jump up and away from this spider, as i do this, the door to the bathroom opens, there's jen, we both scream, me because my fight or flight (in this case flight) response automatically kicks in from my lizard brain thinking i'm getting attacked by this spider, and jen seeing her friend's husband with his pants and underwear down between his legs leaping toward her screaming.

a lot of apologies and light uncomfortable laughter afterwards, and i haven't slept well since.

"by sexually harassing a 9 year old boy. tifu, and it actually happened today. i was driving with my 12 year old daughter. we got caught at a red light next to a restaurant. i glanced at the restaurant and saw a kid walking in the parking lot by himself. it looked like my daughter's friend gabe. i said to her, ""is that..."" and before i could even finish, she said yes.

"by sending my son to school in his pajamas because i had misread ""pi day"" as ""pj day"" in a school email.. let's start off by saying i'm a single dad and my son is in kindergarten. his teacher sent out a message yesterday that said ""tomorrow for pi day we have a parent bringing in a snack."" i had only glanced at it. ten minutes later, i got a message from my son's mom asking if i have a matching set of pjs for him to wear. i replied yes, and then never looked at the teacher's email again.  

fast forward to this morning, and i dress my boy in his favorite pjs and take him to school. as i approach, i notice that no one else is wearing pjs and my son is trotting around in bright red spider man pajama pants. so i get him to the door of the school, send him in, and immediately pull my phone out to look at the email. i had to read it twice before i noticed that it didn't say ""pj day"" at all, but fucking ""pi day!"" 

so i sent an email to his teacher explaining the mix up and asked her to make him feel comfortable today. she said she glossed it over with the other kids and made it a non issue. luckily, they are only 5-year-olds in kindergarten with little self awareness. 

so sorry, son! here's a little lesson on being different!!

tl;dr - sent my son to school in his pajamas because i had misread ""pi day"" as ""pj day"" in a school email. his teacher made it a non issue in class and it didn't scar my son for life, hopefully. 



update: his mom picked him up and said that he immediately asked to call me to let me know that today was not pajama day.  he said that his teacher let him slide because he had enough classroom points, but he knows that it wasn't pj day. lol. his mom took part of the blame. thank goodness he's so young. this would not have worked out as well in first or second grade. 

edit: wow! my first gold and silver. thanks everyone!! i'm glad you enjoyed my story. 

edit 2: sorry for my choice of wording. but let me clarify that there wasn't any blame or consequence by the teacher.  i was self blaming, if anything. the teacher just used the classroom points as a hollow excuse to lighten any ridicule or confrontation from the other kids. i think she was just trying to bring it forward in a positive light and then get past it and move on. no blame or consequence. just the teacher spreading sugar and me feeling like an ass.

"by pretending not to be korean. so i'm korean-canadian but was born in canada and have grown up here my entire life. i ""speak"" korean but it's about at the level of a talented ten year old with a funny canadian accent.

fuck-up happened yesterday. i'm walking down the sidewalk and who i assume are a man and his daughter (who appears around my age) are puzzling in korean over a directory sign. i ask (in korean) if they need any help. the dad seems excited to meet someone who speaks korean. the girl seems shy and doesn't say much besides ""thanks."" they're looking for a nearby mall so i offer to walk them over there since the train station i need is nearby anyway.

the dad asks me where i learned to speak korean so well. this is where the fuck-up begins. i'm pretty insecure about my spoken korean, so when the dad asks where i learned the language, it sounds like he thinks it's obvious i'm not ""actually"" korean. it doesn't help that his daughter is ridiculously pretty, and i want to impress her for some reason. so, i lie. stupid idea. i say i'm actually chinese and learned korean on my spare time, changing my skills from ""mediocre for a korean person"" to ""impressive for a chinese person.""

alas, the dad immediately switches to mandarin which i can't speak a word of. this would have been the time to come clean. instead, panicking at having been exposed, i do my best confused face and then pretend i misspoke and said the korean word for ""chinese"" (jung-guk) when i in fact meant ""japanese"" (ilbon). ha-ha, sorry, my korean isn't very good, right?

of course, the daughter suddenly bursts into fluent and excited japanese, which i also can't speak a word of. i'm in too deep at this point and can't tell them i'm vietnamese or some other variety of asian without making myself even more suspicious, so i do the only logical thing and say i am indeed japanese but don't actually speak japanese (but learned korean cuz lol i'm a traitor to my japanese heritage).

we reach the mall and i'm all too happy to bail at this point, but the girl, who suddenly seems super interested in me, asks (now in practically perfect english – damn polyglots) what i do. i say i go to the local university. she excitedly tells me that she's starting at the same university in september, and that she has just arrived in canada from korea. her ""dad"" seems just as excited by this news and asks me to take care of her once school starts and he goes back to korea.

it turns out that the girl is actually japanese but went to some exchange program in korea for a few years, and that the ""dad"" is actually her chinese-born korean teacher/ sponsor who accompanied her to canada. so, not only did i pretend not to be korean to two people who weren't even korean, but i pretended to be chinese to a chinese man and have now convinced a japanese girl that i'm japanese.

so i exchanged contact information with the girl and we've been talking a lot online since yesterday. turns out she's super nice and funny and interesting and accomplished. we have a ton in common too. we have the same major, and we're the same age, though she's three years behind me because of her exchange program. she seems super stoked to be friends with me since she doesn't know anybody in canada and has been talking to me a lot. i'm becoming increasingly aware that i can't pretend to be japanese forever to this girl and i need to tell her i'm actually korean, but early on she asked me about my family and i went even deeper into the lie, telling her my parents are from kyoto (picked a random city), etc. i've done fucked up, reddit, and i feel terrible about it.

**tl;dr:** am korean, pretended to be chinese to a chinese man, then pretended to be japanese to an awesome japanese girl and am now her first friend in canada (based on a dirty lie).


**edit:** ohhh fuck i think she just asked me out but i'm not sure and i haven't come clean yet help

**edit 2 (night of the 2nd day):** thank you all for the sage advice. i have not yet perished of seppuku as some have feared, although it is increasingly seeming the most promising solution. i'm sure she'd oblige me and do the beheading part.
anyway, i do think we're going on a date tomorrow and i thought i should come clean in person rather than over text. will keep you all updated (unless i die). i haven't even been on a date in over two years so that's already blowing my mind, especially her asking me out. as some have pointed out, i am kinda concerned that she's only interested in me because she thinks i'm japanese, but i think that's more to do with her being more comfortable in a foreign country (canada) when her first friend is a fellow japanese person. maybe i'm terrible at social cues and she just wants to hang out as a friend. in any case, i'll explain it all to her tomorrow in the hopes of being a little less of an asshole (there's no solving that completely). wish me luck in as many languages as you can, reddit. gamsahamnida.

also: they don't use reddit much in japan and korea, do they? i'd hate to be busted via a reddit thread q_q

**edit 3 (still night of the 2nd day)**: oh fuck guys i fucked up again. i was afraid she might stumble upon this post so i asked her if she has heard of reddit cuz i'm a fucking idiot and she said no, much to my relief, but then she asked if she should check it out and i just realized this is going on the front page at this rate and she's gonna find it somebody order an airstrike on me why am i so stupid.

don't lie, kids. lying is very very bad.

**edit 4 (still night of the 2nd day):** okay i think crisis averted for now. she just went to sleep without any sign of having read this. i'm also going to attempt to sleep and hope i wake up japanese. will update. sayonara, reddit.",4
"by fixing my in-law's pc & discovered their into the same kink as my wife.. so, i work in it repair. pc, tablets, mobile phones, that sort of thing. which means, as anyone in the field can attest, means giving free tech support to family and friends. 

so about 2 weeks ago, i'm at my wife's parent's house, taking a look at their sick desktop in return for having my father-in-law service my car. (he's a mechanic)

anyway, fil comes back inside for a coffee break, and is asking me questions about how to sell stuff on ebay. i fire up a browser window, head to ebay and log into his account. my eyes immediately lock onto the fact in the ""recently viewed"" items are an assortment of horse riding crops.

my mind logs this as odd, somewhere in the back of my brain, and moves on with the tutorial, my father-in-law finishes his coffee and heads back out to my car.

i return to cleaning up his pc and scans, etc find a few things that are tied back to a bunch of bdsm / fetish porn sites, spanking videos, etc.

now normally, after a decade of dealing with people's pcs, i have a very ""no judgements"" stance with this sort of stuff. at least the ebay searches for riding crops make sense... 
but my mind chose that moment to remind me that my wife has (somewhat) recently revealed that she's kinda into that sort of thing. we recently had a ""dirty weekend away"", where she revealed that she had recently purchased an assortment of paddles, whips, restraints, and things that vibrate (thanks fifty shades... i guess...?)
*not complaining - lf it gets her off, i'll try just about anything at least once. *

and now, from that day forward, whenever things have gotten a little... spicy in the bedroom, there's a part of my brain that's thinking ""do you know that your parents are into this stuff too?"" 🤔

(i'm sure my wife does not have any knowledge of this, and to learn of it would mortify her to the point that we'd never have sex again.)


tl:dr - fixing my in-law's pc, i discovered that they're into the same kink as my wife... now wondering if my wife's sexual appetites are genetically inherited, or learnt subconsciously. ",4
"by making my gf watch walruses die.. yeah, (last night) royally.  i was watching the making of  ""our planet"" last night and got about 50 mins into it and paused to let my gf in my apartment.  if you haven't seen it, i highly recommend it!  incredible behind the scene documentation of how the videographers set up shots, traveled to exotic locations, survived in insane climates...ending with an unannounced scene of walruses falling to their deaths from a fucking **80 meter cliff**.

my girlfriend comes in, we start cuddling on the couch, resume the doc, and then really sad music starts playing out of nowhere...  i have never seen this documentary before and everything else leading up to it was wholesome af, so this was a little alarming.  before you know it, these god damn walruses are tumbling down giant cliffs because who the fuck knows.  even the camera crew was like ""why are they climbing so high?!""  for god's sake, the footage was in super slow motion and we can clearly see these poor animals' skulls and tusks cracking with every tumble with their bodies curling over one another into a dead walrus stock pile.  it was truly awful and heartbreaking to watch.

my gf immediately separates herself from me, tears silently streaming down her face and says ""i'm going to bed""; it all happened so fast.  she was upstairs crying and i'm staring at a screen filled with dead fucking walruses while camermen and biologists continue crying on screen.  guilt welled up in me because it was my idea to continue watching when she arrived.  it didn't help that she made it clear she is extremely sensitive to any sort of animal death early on in our relationship.

i went upstairs and cuddled up next to her while apologizing.  she understood and wasn't mad at me, although i still felt like a jerk.  before you know it, we were back to laughing and making jokes after a few minutes, so all was well.  we made a deal to never watch any wild life documentaries together ever again (bless you, sir david attenborough).  funny enough, we made plans to go to the zoo on saturday earlier in the week.  avoiding the walrus exhibit at all costs.

edit:  reminder that we were watching the making of the documentary.  a bunch of y'all missed that part in the beginning.

edit part 2: apparently some believe all zoos are evil and are comparable to animals getting their heads bashed in by a rock.  interesting.

edit part 3: i appreciate all of the love and hilarious comments!  and then there is some of y'all that take this internet thing waaaay too seriously.  yikes!

***tl;dr***  i accidentally made my girlfriend cry by watching walruses fall from an 80 meter cliff.  we are going to a zoo on saturday and are avoiding the walrus exhibit.  sir david attenborough is a universal treasure.

"by having sex with an upset stomach nsfw. this happened today. my husband will probably find this and laugh, so if so, hey babe! 

earlier today my husband and i began to fool around; i've had a somewhat upset stomach for the past few days but i thought i'd gotten past the worst of it. evidently, i had not. 

as my husband and i got closer to finishing i felt a pressure in my bowels but decided to keep going because what was the worst that could happen? once we finished i felt a sort of ""pressure"" by my butthole and went to feel only to stick my finger in poo. i had literally orgasmed so hard that i shit, and on my husbands balls too. all i could utter was a simple ""oh no""

my husband immediately figured out what had happened and started laughing; i was a mixture of laughter and tears of embarrassment, but he just comforted me and was gleeful in that now he could claim he ""actually fucked the shit out of me."" i'm lucky to have someone who gives that little a shit (no pun intended). 

tl;dr: had sex and pooped on my husband

*update: i avoided this for 3 days to see if my husband found it. though there are people claiming in the comments they're him, they are not lmao. also, no, we're not getting divorced! he's still making jokes about it so i think we're good.*",4
"by changing my husband's desktop photo.. this happened last night, not today, but still less than 24 hours ago.

so my husband loves birds, all kinds of birds.  he thinks they are great.  he is especially fond of ducks.  last night while he was in the kitchen prepping a snack, i thought it would be fun to change the desktop photo on his laptop (he had left it open on the couch).  i found a cute duck picture, made it his desktop background, set the laptop back on the couch, and made my way innocently back to the kitchen table where i had also been having a snack.

my husband finishes his snack a little while later and heads back to the couch while i remain at the table. he pulls his computer towards him and goes, ""omg honey look!  ducks!"" as he stands up holding his laptop and tries to come to me, he trips and falls over the glass end table we have, shattering it. if that wasn't bad enough, he fell onto his macbook, smashing it completely open and crushing it.  if that also wasn't bad enough, he also broke his wrist because of how he fell on it since he was holding the laptop.  

i feel like a terrible person, but my husband still loves ducks.

tl;dr: my husband got so overexcited over a picture of ducks i procured that he broke himself, a table, and his macbook.",4
"by cleaning my ass with a comb.. this happened all of 45 minutes ago, and yes, it still hurts a bit.

to start, some context. i always take incredibly long showers due to me getting sidetracked by random things, such as spinning in circles in order to get an even distribution of hot water, trying to scratch that damn itch, and the fascination that is my penis.

another thing to note is that i always take a comb with me to the shower as i find it helps ""rub in"" the shampoo, except this time, there was a new comb(https://i.imgur.com/mdy4s21.jpg) that i hadn't seen before. 

now that that is out of the way, let's get into the fuck-up. my shower started off as usual, rubbing a bar of soap absolutely everywhere while trying to use my fingernails to carve designs into the bar. after about five or so minutes of soaping, i moved to the hair process, which also went as planned. this is where i dun goofed. upon seeing this new comb, i decided to use it, as it had finer teeth. after using said comb, i realised that it also had a ^^much sharper/thinner handle. 

>the following actions have been made by a fucking idiot, and is nsfw. proceed with caution.

when i saw the handle, for some unknown reason, i built the thought process of ""this handle is so thin, i bed i'd be able to stick it up my ass and not feel it."" was it sensible? no. was there reasoning behind it? nada. was it a good idea? absolutely not.

that thought was immediately followed up with ""why the hell not,"" which was then followed by a comb, of which i had never seen before, going into my ass. now obviously, with nothing ever being in my ass before, there was a small brown patch on the end of the handle upon removal, and for some reason, i got the god awful idea that i should clean the inside of my ass. how, you ask? stab the handle into a bar of fucking soap, of course. 

with the handle now soapy, i returned to my ass and was immediatly greeted with a slight stinging feeling. ""whatever, thats probably the soap cleaning away and is bound to only be temporary,"" i thought. i. was. wrong. the stinging only got worse once i pulled the comb out. i then spent the rest of my shower rubbing my ass in hopes to get rid of the feeling.

fast forward to nearly an hour later and i am still feeling the consequenses of putting a hair product in my arse.

over all, 1/10, would not penetrate again.

>tldr: i stuck a soapy comb handle up my ass in hopes to clean it. not a good idea.

>edit: too many people are reading about me using a comb to sodomize myself, go away!!

>edit #2: my ass feels fine now. i've eaten a massive cheeseburger, however, so the visit to the bathroom later should be interesting.

>edit #3: a lot of you seem to be concerned as to where the comb came from/whos it is, which is so be expected since i forgot to specify that i had bought it a few months ago and only today found it again. no, thankfully, it was no one else's hair product that became my booty stabber. 

>edit #4: #alright, who did it? who guilded the booty stabber?

>edit #5: it was the soap causing the pain (the pain lasted less than 90 minutes), not the comb. the *buttfuck retarded comb abuser lives to shit another day!

>**also, the comb was mine, don't worry. i had bought it a few months ago because of the finer teeth and had forgotten about it until now.

>edit #6: yes, i have adhd, and yes, it is treated. i am a happy, yet easily distracted curious charlie!",4
"by going down on my wife. one of my favorite things to do is go down on my wife. i have a talented tongue and i like to use it. last night i decided to make that experience even more mind-blowing for my wife by grabbing the dildo and fucking her with it at the same time. fun times were being had by all and things were getting very hot and very wet. then my wife started to orgasm and my hand slipped and the dildo shot out of her vagina and directly into my right eye. i pulled away and she asked what was wrong. not wanting to stop there i told her not to worry about it and i would tell her after. we finish and i go to the bathroom to rinse my face (and eye) and tell her what happened. we both are laughing hard at this but i tell her jokingly ""your vagina just gave me pink eye!""

well, today my eye was red, itchy, burning, and gross. i just left urgent care with drops for pink eye. my doctor thought it was hilarious and burned my ass on the way out saying ""now go to the pharmacy for your vagina drops!""

i always thought my first lesbian sex injury would be a broken finger.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - while going down my wife the dildo popped out of her vagina and hit in the eye resulting in pink eye.

"by accidentally selling my boudoir photo shoot to a drunk pervert. edit #2: i can't handle all the requests to see the photos, so here(https://giphy.com/gifs/middle-finger-mister-rogers-fred-44eq3ab5lpyn6). they're not anything special. 

edit: jesus christ. 1) i admit i was dumb and fucked up, yo. hence this sub. 2) the officer said he wouldn't have gone if he had other things to do, so i didn't exactly waste his time. he said it was unsafe for a stranger to have the compromising photos of me so he understood why i wanted them back. 3) a boudoir shoot is actually a pretty common thing. it is not ""porn"" and i can't believe some of y'all are defending this creep. 

this happened a few months ago. sold our entire bedroom set because we were getting a new one to a nice man in his 60s. he picked up, paid, and all was well. 

a few hours later he messaged me on facebook asking if the pictures were of me. holy shit, i'd forgotten to clean everything out of the nightstand, which still contained a boudoir photo shoot i'd given my husband for our wedding. 

hella embarrassed, i explained what he'd found and that i would be willing to meet him to pick up the album. except now he starts being a creepy asshole and sending wink faces and saying he wants to keep it. the back and forth angry messaging was doing no good. he stopped responding after i threatened to get the cops involved. 

so i call the cops and they say there's not really anything they can do unless he starts actively harassing me; as i sold him the nightstand with the photos in it, they were technically his property. eventually an officer went to his house as a courtesy to me and asked if he'd be willing to return the pictures, which he did. the officer drove to my place and returned them, saying the man was quite drunk and upset that i'd sent the police over. 

tl;dr: i sold a nightstand to an old drunk pervert with my semi-nudes still inside it and things got awkward. the police were called.",4
"and got my name on a suicide watch list. a few weeks ago, i was in my final class of semester, the night before the exam. 
i am a student paramedic, and the mental health of our cohort is very carefully monitored by the school, for obvious reasons. 

as the class ended, the tutor spoke to me to thank me for my effort during the semester, and to say she hoped to see my name on her class list. 
jokingly, i responded, ""they have a list for all the students that throw themselves off the church tower, right? look for my name there!""
most of us have a dark sense of humour in our field, and my tutor was no exception. she laughed with me, then frowned. 
""you know i have to report you for saying that..""
i thought she was joking, and laughed again.
the next day i was contacted by the university's therapist offices to book my first mandatory session. 

tldr: made a stupid joke, got stuck on suicide watch, required to do therapy this semester",4
"by missing the birth of my daughter. happened yesterday at 2am. 

so my wife was pregnant. i work from home in internet marketing so don't get out too too much, but she heard of a cool local tech conference and thought i should check it out. (important detail to remember)

the conference was 2.5hrs away in a neighbouring city. 

anyway.  she was 37 weeks pregnant (babies are typically cooked at 40), and has been feeling great so didn't see any issue with me being gone one night. like, what are the chances?

so me and a friend packed up and left for the conference at 1pm thursday for the evening networking. 

fast forward to 11pm, we're having a beer before heading to bed after the networking is over, and i get a call from my wife:

""i think my water broke.""

""umm.. what?!?""

we're still 3 weeks early so i say no you're probably not, go back to bed. did some quick searches and dr google said that because she wasn't having contractions, and she was otherwise feeling fine otherwise, it might just be pee from baby pressing on her bladder. no need to alarm. 

10 minutes later i get a text, ""contractions started and they hurt like hell. going to hospital now.""

she's home alone and has no way to get to the hospital so is thinking of calling an ambulance, so my friend says his wife will go pick her up and take her. i tell my wife what's going on and she agrees (she's almost incoherent at this point and can't talk or stand during contractions).

meanwhile, we grab our shit and hit the road. 2.5 hours, we should be able to make it in time for the birth. labors usually take 6-12 hours. no big deal. 

she gets to the hospital and they tell her that she's fully dilated and baby's already crowning. 

at this point they get her straight into a room (too late for an epidural), my friends wife gets me on facetime, and i watch in the passenger seat of a car via facetime my daughter being born in record time. 

total time from water breaking to delivered child: 2.25 hours. 

i missed it by an hour. we get there and come cruising in and i got to meet my exhausted wife and beautiful baby daughter. 

so good news, i have a beautiful, healthy baby girl, bad news is i wasn't physically there. but she can't get me in trouble because she sent me to the conference! 

tl;dr: wife sent me to a conference, didn't think we'd have a baby that early, ended up having a baby that early and i missed it.",4
"by letting my kid lay in my lap nsfw. this happened last night. my wife and i were settling down for the evening and sat down on the couch to watch tv while our 13-month old played on the floor. after a short time he apparently decided he wanted to cuddle up on the couch with us. he climbed up on the couch and crept up close to me with a smile and the lates his head down flat on my thigh. it was close to his bed time so i didn't give it a second thought.

we were both really into the show we were watching when suddenly i felt a sharp pain on the top of my penis. i mean like a turtle had just reached out and latched on. i screamed in pain at first and looked down to realize my son had shifted his head slightly against the shorts i was wearing, and just chomped down. he may still be a baby but he has some sharp ass teeth.

i grabbed him to get him off and my wife didn't understand what was happening. she thought i was just randomly in pain and trying to throw our son. it looked like that, well, because he wouldn't freaking let go. i finally tugged him away and to the floor and he screamed crying as my wife went to console him and i got up and cupped a hand to my crotch and paced back and forth with a feeling i'd never felt before.

i walked outside to get away from the crying for a moment and stinging pain wasn't stopping. after a few moments i returned inside and looked inside my pants to survey the damage. my penis was bleeding from the tip. he left a freaking indention with his teeth. still hurts today every time anything brushes against it. i'll be way more cautious going forward about where he's laying his head. my wife later laughed and called him amazing birth control.

tl;dr let my kid lay on my lap and found out how sharp his teeth are. now i've got a cut and sore penis.",4
"by having my son clean his room.. to start off this is my wife's story and  it happened at the beginning of the year. 

some back story we have 2 kids a 10 year old and a 2 year old. why 8 years apart well me and the mrs tried having a kid for 7 years before she became pregnant.  so the 10 year old helps out a lot and is a great kid. we are truly lucky to have this child. 

well at the beginning of the year the two year old had started to potty train him self. telling us he had to go potty and then going potty. so we get him some pull ups and start that phase. we also have a 3 bedroom home and the boys share a room (the 10 year olds idea not mine). 

cue the day of said fu. the 2 year old had been playing in their room just out of ear shot of the wife. she would check on him every few minutes just to make sure he was all right. well he comes to her and says (we think) mommie slim yucky. 

oh no my wife thinks and calls for the oldest. hey, oldest the 2 year old got into your slime can you clean it up for me while i make lunch. so the oldest goes into the room to clean it up and my wife picks up the two tear old to clean him up. it's at this time she sees the 2 year old doesn't have his pull up on, and after a few minutes my oldest calls out, ""mom! can slime go bad?"" she walks into the room to she my 10 year old trying to clean up a huge pile of runny poo that is all over the floor with his bare hands. 

so after a few screams and laughs from my wife she tells him to go take a hot shower and she cleans the mess her self. then let's him play on the switch for the rest of the day. 

tldr: 10 year old tries to clean up runny poo with hands thinking it was slime.

edit. holy shit ( no pun intended) this blew up. you guys have me in tears laughing on my lunch break. thanks so much. 

but to answer a question or statement i have gotten in dms. no my oldest doesn't baby sit but does help out around the house. keeping his toys picked up and out of reach of the little one. normally he does a great job. is just one of said responsibilities.

edit #2 got gold? thanks it means a lot. you guys have made my day. 

also my wife and kids did this diy slime thing and at one part you add food coloring to make it the color you want. my son made his brown. cause he added multiple colors. so when the little one runs in saying slime yucky it wasn't a weird thing and he has gotten into it  before. my oldest wasn't playing in it. he was trying to clean it up.  and the whole thing was over the span of a few minutes. so he wasn't in there for that long trying to clean it up. 

and i forget not everyone knows things. but if you google slime it should clear up confusion.",4
"by treating my horse like a dog. technically, my fuck up was last night. let me start by saying, i rent a beautiful home in the country on 200 acres of land. i have a horse, dog, and 3 cats. my horse lives in a field in my backyard. 6 acres of beautiful grass, hills, a stream, and a huge 20x10ft stall, all properly fenced.

last week, my horse bruised his foot and was limping. i decided to put up a temporary fence in my yard and keep my lame horse in my backyard where the ground is soft and the grass is greener. he could barely walk so there was really no concern over him escaping. he was beyond over joyed.

yesterday, i had the ferrier come and fix his shoes as he was no longer limping. here's where the fuck up  begins. i loved having my horse in the backyard. it was like having a giant dog hanging out with me. so i figured, what's the harm in one more night?

6 am, my phone is ringing. it's my landlord. there are 12 state trooper at my house trying to wrangle my horse who is leisurely strolling down the main road. he was fine, they had fun, my horse made friends with a super sweet lady trooper who was giggling the whole time she was walking him back home while he was nuzzling her face.

not nearly the worst of fuck ups but i thought everyone might enjoy something that doesn't involve sex.

tldr: treated my horse like a dog for a week while he was injured, only to have him escape when he felt better, causing a closed road and a bunch of state troopers a fun morning playing cowboy.

edit: thank you for teaching me how to photo on reddit. here are some pics of my ridiculous old man and the lovely property we live on. 

my old dude, stan the man https://imgur.com/gallery/zes4gso

edit 1: oh my god! thank you everyone for the gold and silver and all the lovely comments. i'm so glad i shared this. has been becoming a shit show lately and i just wanted to share some goodness with the community. also, to those of you who think i need another horse, i promise you i don't. he's very happy with the peacock and chickens that live in his paddock. he doesn't have any issues with running or pacing. he wasn't out looking for a friend. a section of temporary fence fell down and he walked out my front yard.",4
"by poisoning my cat, parsley. this guy(https://i.imgur.com/uu57bdj.jpg)
usually parsley is a **huge dildo cat**, always wanting food and pats, biting if he doesn't get what he wants, sitting on my face, **big dick energy** without the balls.

this morning when i woke up later than usual he was not up in my grill wanting food, weird but okay. he's sleeping curled up on the couch, when i say good morning he looks at me like - __- and gets up. tries to jump of the couch, stumbles, lands **face first.**

i laugh he gets up and he starts walking weird, not limping just uncoordinated. usually he's **pretty vocal** too especially when he's hungry but he was **completely quiet**, his sister smacked him and he barely even **reacted**

now i'm **freaking out**, thinking he has a **blood clot or a brain tumor** or something. i book him in for an urgent appointment at the vet in half an hour.

i keep an eye on him while we wait, at one point he tried to scratch his ear with his back leg and **missed several times.** when he tried to loaf he was sort of **wibbling wobbling.** he didn't seem interested in food until i started feeding his sister, shenanigans, but luckily he ate so i was feeling a bit better.

**at this point i'm crying thinking the motherfucker is gonna die on me like a bitch.**

we take him to the vet, he goes into his carrier calmly without incedent which is very unusual. vet tests his legs, stretching them out and rotating, nothing there. he often gets abscesses from fights but nothing like that. vet checks his gums and teeth, his gums are a bit pale which is an **indication of onion toxicity which is fatal**. we'd had nachos the night before which has a bean mix with onions. i tell them he might have gotten some from the pan since we didn't clean it up straight away. if the onion toxicity is bad enough he might **need a blood transfusion to save his life.**

he's also slightly overweight and middle aged which makes him **at risk for diabetes** which can cause nerve damage when left untreated. 

he's kept at the hospital for the rest of the day for observation and blood tests. vet gives me **brochures on possible household toxins** that are harmful to cats. i go home in tears thinking my cat might be **dying** and blaming myself for not cleaning up the **freaking nachos** last night.

i read some of the brochures to calm down. i go through them thinking maybe he got to some lilies in a neighbours backyard or he licked bleach out of toilet. then there was **the last entry.**

**marijuana. oh fucking shit fuck.**

motherfucker i'd made some **super strong cannabutter** last night in prep for a patrick swayze move night this weekend. that pot had a cup of butter and **a quarter ounce of hydro, simmering for 3 hours**. parsley also **loves butter** and the smell of weed doesn't put him off. 

parsley has always been **terrified of stoves** though, from when he touched it while it was on so he doesn't go near them while they're lit. i'd strained and refrigerated the cannabutter quickly after making it but i'd left the dirty pot in the sink over night. i decide to check it and

**that bitch is suspiciously clean.**

parsley isnt fucking **dying** he's just high as a **god damn kite.**

i have to call the vet and tell them my suspicions. his blood test came back negative for anything scary. he'd had **6 serves of chicken** while at the vet and **napped** almost all day, played with some dogs and snuggled with some kittens. motherfucker had a **great time. **


**tldr i made dank cannabutter, left out the dirty pot in the sink overnight, stupid cat licked it clean and had a real good time on my dime. i should charge him for it. **

edit 1: boy, this bold keyword thing is very contentious huh

edit 2: can now confirm after making caramels that the cannabutter is strong

edit 3: there were some people worried that i would be letting parsley eat his fill in the future. i assure you i will not, i did say it was a fuck up after all

"by cleaning my humidifier and almost killing my entire family. obligatory - this actually did happen today.

my family and i live in the sun-blasted hellscape that is central arizona, usa.  the whole area is a hot, dry desert, and if you live outside of the city (as we do) it's common to see relative humidity in the teens, and single digits are not uncommon.  for those who don't live somewhere that's anathema to life, that's very dry.  since we aren't a family of kangaroo rats, we keep the air in our house comfortable with an evaporative humidifier.  basically, a pump drips water on an absorbent pad, and a fan pulls air through that pad to blow out more humid air to the house.  it's one of the full household-sized jobs that will humidify your air with twelve gallons of water a day.

for various reasons not apropos to this tifu, the humidifier hadn't been maintained well for the last few weeks.  today i decided to change the filter and give it a good cleaning.  possibly inspired by another recent tifu, i also decided to attack the calcium buildup with a 1/3 vinegar solution.  while cleaning, though, i noticed a sliminess that made me think that there was bacterial growth.  ""no big deal,"" thought i.  eventually a biofilm will grow on something that's always wet, no matter what precautions you take.  i scrubbed off the biofilm, cleaned the calcium scale with my vinegar solution, and reassembled the unit.

here's where the really starts.  some parts of the mechanism aren't accessible - they are in the pump, water lines, etc.  i decided to run my vinegar solution though for a few minutes to dissolve some calcium deposits in places i couldn't reach.  ""but,"" thought i, proving that too much thinking causes trouble, ""there's probably bacteria in there, too.""  i figured i should add something that would kill the bacteria and what, i figured, is better at that than bleach?

right now, readers with some chemistry are thinking, ""uh, dude..."" yeah, i know.  or, i should have known.  but i didn't think it through, so i poured some bleach into the humidifier, followed by the remains of my vinegar solution, and turned it on to pump the mixture into the water lines.  almost immediately thereafter, i took a whiff and started coughing.  at that point the little voice that remembered my college chemistry finally was heard.  turns out mixing a sodium hypochlorite solution (like, say, bleach) with a weak acid (like, say, vinegar) creates chlorine and chloramine gasses, both of which are very toxic - like, they have been used as actual chemical weapons toxic, and i'd just put them in a goddamn distribution system.

i immediately unplugged the humidifier and carried it to the bathroom, turned on the vent fan, and poured my ersatz chemical weapon down the bathtub drain.  of course, the pouring process gave me another good snoot of the offending vapors.  so now the house is airing out, the wife, son, and dog are playing in the backyard for a bit, the wife is trying to mail back my engineering degree, and for the next few days i'll be coughing like i've got the black lung, pa.

tl;dr - tried to clean my humidifier, accidentally tried to kill my family trench warfare style.

edit - words

edit 2 - front page, neat.  it has been pointed out that there wouldn't be chloramine, just chlorine - i think this story shows that chemistry isn't my forte.  finally, to those giving me shit for making sure to mention that i'm an engineer, i have to - if everyone doesn't know, i'm just some guy with a lot of student loan debt.  can't have that.

edit 3 - lot's of fake internet points and my first gold!?  it's almost worth the war crime!  thanks!",4
"by wearing reflective glasses to a poker game. mandatory this didn't happen today, it happened saturday night.

so me and my friends have a saturday night poker game, and this time we decided to spice it up and play for money. we all brought in 100$ to  start. now this is where i fucked up. i bought these new pair of aviators that i really liked and made me look really cool. so i decided to wear them to the game, which was inside. i hoped it would improve my poker face, which is lacking. it was also sunset, and the sun was hurting my eyes as i was facing the window. i proceed to have the worst game of my life. they knew exactly when to call my bluff and when to fold. it was like magic, i couldn't get it. i went out super quickly. they continued playing until the end, and as we were leaving i told my friends ""you guys have balls of steel!"" my friends started laughing like crazy, and i asked them what gives. they said, ""you know those glasses are reflective, right?"" and i realize they could see every hand i had through my glasses. they laughed and handed me 50$ as compensation.

tl;dr: don't wear aviators to a poker game. you will lose a lot of money

edit: added some more details

edit 2.0: super glad you guys found this story as funny as i did! for clarification, i was holding the cards in front of my chest and down to my stomach,  even sometimes i was leaning forward with my elbows on the table. it was easy for them to see them.

these guys are my best friends. they would bail me out in a minute. if i had asked, they would have given my money back. but because it was so funny, i let them keep it. i'm bad at betting anyway, and this was a special occasion (hence the high buy in)

also mandatory rip inbox. i'll reply to as many comments as i can! 

edit 3.0: mah man! thanks for the gold! guess this bambooz - i mean post worked! /s

edit 4.0: this is so sad. can we hit 30k likes? /s",4
"by giving a homeless guy $80. preface: 
*not trolling for money, thanks* 


so i'm a semi-broke grad student and lyft driver and this morning it was raining in my city. i ran into cvs to grab something and i was wearing an old coat with deep pockets (relevant to story). i also paid in cash which i never do as i rarely carry cash. so i walk out after buying my couple of items and see this older homeless man i often see in my neighborhood. i give him a dollar here or there some days when i can. he's in his wheelchair looking helpless and getting rained on so i figure, hey, even though i'm broke (as in my bills are insane and i make just enough atm to live and support my family) i can still give my coat because i have a few decent ones, i'm dry in my car today, this coat is older but in good shape and will keep him warm.... etc... so i give him the coat and he mumbles ""thanks"" and i smile and tell him to stay warm and off i go... later as i'm working i stop to grab gas and realize i put the $80 change from that morning into my coat pocket without thinking. i would never go ask for it back (obviously) but i had a moment of semi- panic before i accepted that i just gave this dude all that money. best ""screw up"" ever, i suppose. i'll live. i have to be totally honest and say i was upset at first but i'll get over it and it did make me stop and realize that i should be grateful for my blessings this time of year, no matter how broke i feel.

happy holidays guy.

edit: to whoever gave the gold... i'm so inexperienced with reddit i had to look up what it even was. haha. wow. really didn't expect much response at all i'm honored. thank you kindly.",4
"by letting our dog hang out while we did the dirty.  so  my girlfriend has been working early mornings all week due to some  staff shortages, and even though we've been feeling frisky all week, we  haven't had the time. so, when friday night rolls around, we're raring  to go.

usually, our dog hates being near  us when we're rolling in the sheets (literally) because there's nowhere  for her to lie on the bed. so, her thing is that she curls up in her  doggie bed and waits for it all to blow over before coming back onto the  bed for cuddles.

sparing everyone the  details, the foreplay's pretty good. unfortunately, it's a little too  good, as for some reason our dog starts getting concerned and maybe  thinks that our sounds are distress calls or something. she hops on the  bed and starts licking my gf's face. it's cute, until she decides to  start to lick mine.

in a fit of ""oh no i  can't let her lick my lips because then i can't kiss my girlfriend  anymore"" madness, i reflexively back away... and knee my girlfriend's,  uh, nether regions in the process.

she  rolls over in pain, but she's cry laughing, and both of us just are lost  at how absurd this has been. meanwhile, our dog, oblivious to it all,  is having the time of her life as my girlfriend is dying of pain and i try my best to comfort her.

needless to say, i didn't get any last night. will try again tonight, but i'll keep the dog in her crate as a precaution.

&#x200b;

tl;dr:  our sex scared the dog, the dog scared me, i kneed my girlfriend in the  verguba, ruined the moment, and didn't get laid :(",4
"by permanently burning myself trying to connect with my recently deceased dad.. this was actually a week ago, but the story starts before that.

for the last five years, i've had an ice cream tub full of sugar in my kitchen. i emptied it into the tub rather than have the bag spill sugar whenever i used it. i don't use sugar a lot, so i've never had to refill it, i just dip into it when i need it.

my girlfriend thinks this is weird, and she thought it was weirder still when i packed the box to move with me when we decided to move in together.

""don't bring your weird five year old sugar tub, for fuck's sake.""

""it's perfectly fine,"" said i. ""sugar doesn't go off."" 

""it does,"" she said, wrongly.

""it doesn't and i'm not going to throw out totally useable sugar.""

so the sugar tub resides in our baking cupboard now, as a tiny point of pride. i want to see how long it takes for the sugar to run out. maybe it will outlive me, at which point it will be inherited by my beautiful, supportive, wrong girlfriend.

---o---

fast forward to this past january. my dad dies suddenly and unexpectedly. he falls off the roof while fixing a skylight, a day before someone was coming to start work on repairing the entire roof - including the skylight. but that was my dad to his core. he didn't know how to stop. he single-handedly ran his business - selling boating equipment and fixing outboard engines - for 47 years, a minimum of six days a week, until the day he died.

i am not that person. i love stopping. i'm self-employed too, but i put the bare minimum in to survive and spend the rest of the time doing whatever i like. my dad couldn't have lived like that. we were very different people, and that made his passing all the more difficult because now we'd never get any closer - the slightly awkward, stilted conversations i'd had with him in life were now all we had. that was as close as we'd gotten.

fast forward again to last week, early june. we're trying to sell his shop, but it's a tip. sadly, a couple of weeks before he died he invested around £50k in restocking the shop, and so the back shop is full to the ceiling with empty cardboard boxes. and the secondary room, his workshop, is full of tools, spare parts, half-empty paint cans and half-finished engines that haven't been touched in at least a decade, very likely double or triple that.

i get to work. breaking down the cardboard boxes doesn't take as long as i thought, and after lunch i start on the workshop. my dad specialised in seagull engines, which are now collectible, so i'm sorting everything into rubbish piles and this might be worth something piles.

then, at the back of a jammed drawer, under some oily rags and a grimy toothbrush, i find an ice cream tub. i open it up, and it's half-full of sugar.

the best before date is from 1998. so he's had this box of sugar since i was 12 years old. maybe longer. for his coffee i'm assuming.

i call my mum through from the front of the shop.

""look,"" i say. ""dad had a box of sugar.""

""why would he have a box of sugar?""

*""because its perfectly bloody normal, that's why.""* i take a photo to send to my girlfriend, hoping my smugness will come across without needing to caption it.

""won't it be out of date?""

""guh, no.""

she doesn't look convinced. i lick my finger and dip it into the sugar.

""look,"" i say, ""it's fine.""

i put it in my mouth, and know immediately that it's not sugar. it's bitter, and it's bubbling, and fuck everything my tongue is burning. i run out of the workshop and take a swig of coke, swill it around my mouth and spit it into the street. i do that another half dozen times, but i've already burned my tongue very badly. one of my dad's friends comes from the end of the pier.

""everything okay?"" he asks.

""yeah. ugh. i just ate what i thought was sugar from an ice cream tub in the back. it wasn't sugar.""

he laughs. ""why would your dad have had-""

""i don't know.""

he walks in and comes back with the tub. it's caustic soda, he says. for cleaning engines.

i now have chemical burns on my tongue. it's been a week, and they haven't healed. i can't eat or drink anything in the least bit hot or acidic. i told my girlfriend, and she didn't even laugh. apparently having an ice cream tub full of sugar isn't normal.

**tl;dr: my girlfriend makes fun of me for having a big tub of old sugar. i find a big tub of old sugar in my late father's workshop, and in a haze of validation taste it. it's a chemical cleaning agent.**

**edit:** thank you for all the kind words about my writing. i'm cleaning the flat today, so checking back here is a real boost. 

dad used to give me shit occasionally for being uncomfortable plugging my work. so. if you like my writing style, and if you want to hear more, i have this piece about the courtney love / kurt cobain conspiracy theory which i'm really proud of.

"by knocking up a girl on the first night, but wait. title says it all. i met her through tinder, the condom broke but she said not to worry because she's on the pill. fast forward a week, where i see her for the second time, and she tells me that she's pregnant. boring story, i know. now for the fun part. i saw self harm scars on her arm, but only on the second night (she insisted on having the lights off on the first night). she then proceeded to tell me that those were from her two previous abortions, where she was so tortured about it that she had to do this. and that now she probably couldn't handle a third abortion and that anyways she actually knows how to kill herself this time. my heart fucking sank, man. she's now coming over and will be here in an hour, so that we could continue talking. we barely slept because we were talking about it and she says she's 70% sure she wants to keep the baby, but that she wouldn't ask any help from me, except seeing the baby once in a while. i can barely believe what i'm typing right now. i bought two early pregnancy tests, the expensive kind. i don't know what to do. any advice?

​tl;dr i knocked up a girl on the first night seeing her, the crazy came out on the second night a week later with the news, and she's 70% sure she wants to keep it. send help.

update: holy shit i dodged the biggest fucking bullet ever, i feel like bullet bill just zipped passed my cranium.

so she got here and just acted all cool, asking about my day and stuff. she then went on to explain how she felt all bloated and preggo and i just couldn't believe the amount of bullshit coming out of her mouth. i cut her off and told her i didn't believe in the timing of things (i had looked it all up before she got here) and said that i needed actual proof.

her being a nurse, she insisted that she had access to blood test that could detect hcg levels only four days after conception, which i knew was bullshit. she was so manipulative, she kept on saying that ""she's in medical, so she just knows better"". and i just kept bringing up the 11-14 days period of time after conception needed to take a relevant blood test.

in the end i just told her that she was a bad liar and that her manipulation attempts were in vain. so i told her to leave, now. she called a friend to pick her up and then just stared at me, smiled and said that she would wait there, in my living room. and then the show began.

she said, among other things, ""why would i ever lie about being pregnant, i'm 21!"" ""you should be ashamed of making me feel like a dirty slut!"" ""how could i even be pregnant from another guy, you're the only guy i've been with recently"" ""oh, by the way, i already have a son, i know how these things work"". gems.

her still being in my living room, i told her to leave or i'd call the cops. she smiled the sassiest smile at me, so i did. after some more back and forth she eventually went outside on the steps while saying how much of a white guy kind of thing i was doing by calling the cops (she is half carribean half european, but basically black).  i closed the door with an intentionally loud sigh. fin

anyways, thanks for the support everyone, it truly helped me.

​update #2:(album) https://imgur.com/a/lndqtss(https://imgur.com/a/lndqtss)

update #3: so i'm staying as far away as possible. haven't had contact with her since theses texts. now for timeline clarification; we met for the first time last tuesday, and again monday night. she said she wanted to get a hold of me during the weekend to tell me about it, which implies a test on friday, not even 72 hours after ""conception"". she then changed her story saying she got the test on sunday to try to make it more believable timewise i guess. she insisted that she's pregnant and that it's mine. so she basically announced all of that to me 6 days after we first met. when i asked for her to take the test for me she flat out refused, citing disrespect on my part. oh and the last kicker? right before leaving she said ""that's why i shouldn't have told you, all guys react the same"". now please refer to me as neo.",4
"by letting a guy use my bathroom during our garage sale. happened over the summer.

so, we're in the process of moving and i figure now is a good time to unload most of the stuff my wife and i have collected over the years- which is a lot considering we have children. last weekend we had a pseudo-estate sale in which was staged in half of the house, driveway, and garage. considering it was about 1,000 degree outside, i took the garage while my wife manned the inside post. midway through the day, an elderly gentleman asked if he could you my bathroom- he explained he just took medicine and didn't think he'd be able to make it home. now, my wife and i had serious rules about this- our answer was supposed to be no bathroom for customers. however, i had to make a snap judgement call and this guy looked very well put together. i also thought that he just took a water pill that lots of old folks are on and he just needed to take a quick squirt and we'd all be fat, dumb, and happy. but i'm not a complete idiot. i told him he'd better check with the boss upstairs because of the aforementioned agreement. he chuckled and understood and away he went. 10 minutes or so later, i see him leaving. i figured all is well.
a few minutes after that, my wife comes down to the driveway glaring at me. i assumed it was because i shirked the responsibility of telling this old guy no bathroom and made her look like the bad guy if she said ""no"". i couldn't be more wrong. apparently this guy had a colostomy bag and it was chock full of shit. he tried to change it out in our bathroom and spilled the entire contents all over the floor and made no attempt to clean it up. he simply walked out of the bathroom and told my wife our dog must have had an accident. he. blamed. my. dog.",4
"by summoning a kenyan drug lord on a school trip. yes reddit. its here. for those just joining us, i must again apologise for this took place some time ago.

in my second last year of secondary school i was fortunate enough to participate in a volunteer program in east africa over my summer holidays. the idea was we'd spend a month constructing new classrooms for a struggling school on the coast of kenya, south of mombasa and then work in a safari park (shimba hills iirc) before crossing over to tanzania for an actual safari in ngorongoro crater and then top it off with an ascent of mt kilimanjaro. this wasn't free by the way, i had signed up for it a year before and had participated in loads of fund raising events to make it happen.

we had two teachers accompany us on the trip, mr f who was a no nonsense former royal marine commando as well as mr b who was an absolute legend. mr f's girlfriend also joined us, she wasn't a teacher but she had first aid qualifications. 

mr f utterly despised me and my friends who were, embarrassingly, the sk8r/st0ner contingent of the school, with long hair, band t's, the works. to him we were useless pinheads and he sent us on all the worst jobs on the construction site. mr b was more interested in ordering in crates of kilimanjaro beer and trading albums with me (afi - sing the sorrow for nofx - so long and thanks for all the shoes was probably my favourite swap). i wont digress too much but giving a band of masai mara warriors my cd player later in the trip and watching them do their leaping dances to nofx was awesome.

during our free time we had befriended the local villagers who enjoyed inviting us to their homes for food and trying to sell us trinkets, cigarettes and awful tasting home-brewed coconut wine. eventually the most charismatic villager, a fisherman named sayid stepped up to the plate and offered us some weed. we bought a stick off him for about $5 down in the mangroves thinking we'd smoke it later when the teachers were asleep but he insisted on rolling it up, pure, into a single huge spliff and we hopped in his little boat and he took us on a tour of the mangrove swamp.

""you like?"" he said.
""yeh its not bad, at home we smoke hash though, do you get it in kenya too?"" i replied. remember this part, as everything that happened later is contingent on this verbal exchange.

during the boat ride i wasn't feeling much, but then it suddenly hit me as we went back to shore: pure brain melt, watery bloodshot eyes, insane paranoia. then the bell rang summoning us back to the camp. i was not ready. we tried to join up with the rest of the group as inconspicuous as possible, but likely looking as conspicuous as hell. over the course of lunch mr f kept on giving us weird looks, feeding my paranoia even more. eventually his gf came up to us and said something like ""boys, your eyes look a bit funny, what have you been up to?"" cold sweats.
""its just hay-fever miss, the villagers took us in the long grass and the pollen got me really bad"".
""it doesn't look like that too me, i better not see you like this again or you'll be sent home"".

about half an hour later, two unexpectedly looking nice cars came down the dirt track leading to our camp. i didn't give them much heed but they pulled up to the gate and about 5 or 6 of the scariest looking dudes got out. 

""my name, can you come to the gate, some people want to speak to you"" someone said, i don't remember who. 

as i was still high i started to panic again and the paranoia was back. i walked over to them. i'm not sure how the conversation went, but the scope of this most colossal fuck up dawned on me. sayid had totally misunderstood me with his broken english. he had thought that i was asking to send hash back home and this was his lucky day and he could act as broker for a deal that would set him up for life, likely calling someone who called someone else and so on until the news had reached some senior guy from mombasa who had come down to the camp to strike a deal. and listen reddit, before you jump on me and call me an idiot and tell me not to travel, lets think about this first. in no way is this a reasonable outcome for the conversation i just had. yeh fine, smoking on a school trip is never a good idea, but i was in the army cadets for 4 years and every trip turned into a smoke up after dark without incident.

i think i managed to mumble some sort of feeble excuse like ""i'm sorry i have to go"". then i ran and hid in the toilets and locked the door.

about a minute later i heard mr f yell my name.

""where the fuck are you, you filthy little druggie""
""where is he boys?""
""hes in the toilet sir""
silence, then mr f's huge tree trunk arms pounding on the door.
""you fucking little shit, what have you done? who are these people? come out here now""

""i can't sir.... i'm on the toilet, its really bad"" this was sadly the best thing i could think of.
""get the fuck out here now""
""i can't sir, its diarrhoea, really bad""
""you fucking little liar, open this door""

he was trying to shake it off its hinges. i wanted to die, i wanted the ground to open up and swallow me, i was going to get expelled, my parents were going to kill me, my life was effectively over.

at this point mr f's girlfriend and mr b stepped in, urging him to calm down.

""let us talk to him"". 
""what happened, why are these people here""
""i'm so sorry, i was just talking about weed and he must of got the wrong idea, i have no idea how this could of happened.""

somehow it was smoothed over, i don't know how, but i stayed in that toilet for hours, fearing shame, mockery and punishment when eventually that door was opened. when i came out the dealers from mombassa were gone. the teachers had searched all my stuff and found nothing which had further supported my defence. 

the rest of the trip passed without incident. i wasn't expelled, my parents weren't called, mr f was even nice to me after a few days, probably embarrassed about totally flipping out. sure there were a few jokes but it was just too surreal to continually feel bad about. also i think mr b and miss f had done me a huge favour by calming mr f, coming to my defence and for that i am forever grateful.

tl;dr a simple misunderstanding during a conversation with an enterprising kenyan fisherman resulted in gangsters driving down from mombassa to arrange terms with me for a hash smuggling operation back to the uk, temporarily making a teacher go berserk at me.

edit 1: thank you again for all the feedback. it's been great having this interaction as it's been a lonely time on my road trip these last few weeks.

i'll try and post my indian mishap on sunday and round off the trilogy. 

on a final note before i go to bed: travel has really helped me with some serious issues in my life such as depression, anxiety and low self esteem. i'd like to create an elitism free space to help and encourage others to give it a go and share experiences, both positive and calamitous. if anyone knows of a suitable medium please message me (i'm not particularly tech savvy fyi).  

edit 2: i should of elaborated on this more but the library was closing and i was trying to hammer out the events as fast as possible on a proper keyboard. they were driving clean bmws (or similar) in an area where most people didn't even have a car, same goes for their clothing.

there was also obviously a head guy amongst them and he has a fair bit of jewelry on. whatever he said to 16 year old me cemented the idea that he was a big deal in my head but i just can't recall what. ",4
"by almost getting my dad in trouble for child porn. so this happened about 15 years ago when i was around 8 years old. its a memory that came back to me all of sudden and me realizing how fucked it really was.

my dad had a digital camera that me and my brother used to play with a lot. we took pictures of many different things around the house.

then an idea popped up in my head. idk why i thought this was a good idea but i decided to take a picture of my brother's, who is 7 at the time, butthole. like close up shots of my brother spreading his ass cheeks. multiple shots, different angles, i was doing a photoshoot on my brother's asshole. we were laughing a lot and having fun with it. 

i left the pictures in the camera and just forgot about it. few weeks later, my dad didnt look at what was inside the memory card. and went to costco to get the pictures printed. 

the people that handled the photos saw a close up photoshoot of my brother's asshole. there must have been atleast 10 photos from what i remembered. that shit was child pornography.

the good thing was nothing came out of it which is what i am most shocked about. my dad called us in the room to show us what we did. his reaction was ""what the hell is this!"" and ripped it to shreads. that was that. 

15 years later i realized how things could have turned bad for my dad if someone actually tried to do something that day.

tldr:  took pics of my bros butthole with a camera, my dad ,without knowing ,went to costco to print them, people that work at costco saw a photoshoot of my brothers asshole, dad didnt get in trouble thankfully.

edit: yes costco actually printed them out. i remember them being in a nice little paper envelope.

edit 2: i am surprised by how common kids are taking pictures of each other buttholes. still havent found my name yet in the comments. maybe i should just ask him about it. we are pretty close but its just really weird to bring up.

edit 3: now that i think about what would happen if i told my brother. its too fking awkward and cringey. ""hey remember that time i took pictures of your asshole?"" i will set the price at five platinums for me to tell him. why is it so high? cause i know yall wont be able to do it.

edit 4: what the actual fuck! i did the research, i looked at the top of all time of tifu. and all it had was 6 plats at most. it happened in less than 5 mins. oh god. im in class right now. ill update tonight. fuck me.

edit 5: tldr at the bottom. 

8 platinums is 8 platinums. during the whole class period i couldnt focus in class at all, because i was thinking of what would happen. these are the type of memories that stay in the back of your mind never to be mentioned ever again. 

as i was driving home, i thought how the fuck did it get to this point. it was only suppose to be a funny story i post and maybe get gold. it turned to a situation where now im about to tell my brother something so awkward and terrifying to me. 

i get home and go upstairs where my brothers at. i say ""sup"" and he tells me about class and other shit. im in my head the whole time like ""fuck its about happen"". i look at him laughing nervously. 

bro: what?!

me: haha oh god

bro: what?!

me: hey remember when--haha-when 

i was dying slowly inside couldnt even look him in the eye

me: remember when i-- hahaha-- took pictures of.... your asshole

bro: whaaaaat?! you did?!! hahaaha wtf are you talking about? 

me: you dont remember at all?

bro: noooooo! wtf??!! hahhaha

i reveal everything that happened and showed him the post, he was dying. i was also dying but on the inside with cringe and awkwardness.  he didnt even remember, now he will forever remember what i did to him. how the fuck did my brother's asshole get to the top post?

tldr: told my brother, lots of wtfs and lmaos, doesnt remember at all, my top post is about my bros asshole, he will remember this for the rest of his life. but hey 8 platinums is 8 platinums.",4
"by removing my diva cup. nsfw. after getting tired of shoving bits of cotton in my 'nanner curtains for years, i switched to the menstrual cup a while back. *for those that don't know, it's basically this little silicone cup you pop into your lady bits and you can wear for like 12 hours.*

anywhoo, after sleeping all night, i needed to empty it. i headed to the bathroom, lined the toilet with toilet paper to prevent splash back, and proceeded to remove it. now, i always look to see how full the cup is after removal. it's a weird thing to do, but i think it's kinda cool to see how much is in there. 

apparently, unbeknownst to me, my bathroom spider bro was also interested in my red water tidings. as i was removing the cup, he dropped down to check out the situation. not expecting a spider to the face that early in the morning, i jerked back, shrieked, and fell off the toilet.

 remember what was in my hand? yeah, it was a full cup. **everywhere.** on the tub, on the wall, all over me, it was a mess.
naturally, my so heard me yell, and the thud of my lard ass falling off the toilet and came running, only to find me on the bathroom floor, covered in blood, yelling about a spider. i'm surprised the poor guy didn't faint.

tl;dr: a spider surprised me, i threw blood everywhere and my so thought i was dying.

edit: holy shit guys, i wasn't expecting this many responses! for those asking, my mom came up with the nanner curtains thing and it stuck lol, and spider bro has retreated to his corner of the bathroom. also the boyfriend is fine, slightly traumatised, but he'll live.",4
"by giving my girlfriends cat a chance to kill us.. normally when i go to bed i put my girlfriends cat in the spare bedroom. it is always getting into crap it shouldn't so we like to make sure it can't break anything while we sleep. last night he was being extra calm and sweet so my girlfriend convinced me to let him stay out as a ""treat"" for good behavior. i woke up in the middle of the night because i had a dream about peeing and we all know where that leads. but as soon as i woke up i smelt a horrible smell (to groggy at the time to realize what it was) and i was very short on breathe. turns out he somehow turned the gas on the stove on and tried to kill us in our sleep.",4
"by not washing anything i own for over a year. so this was an ongoing fuck up that occurred over the past year and a half.  we ran out of laundry detergent and my wife and i separately stopped at the store (we both didn't know the other was stopping) and bought some. (edit: we both bought the same thing) 

so that's the laundry detergent i've been using to wash everything for nearly a year and a half. clothing, towels, sheets etc. all of it. i basically grabbed each bottle of detergent in turn so they both lasted forever 

finally both bottles hit empty about a week ago and i dragged my ass to the store because i needed clean towel. i head to the detergent section and grab the same bottle i've been using for a year an a half (free and gentle. i don't like scented stuff) 

that's when i freeze. because the bottle i'm holding, the same type of bottle i've been using for a year and a half... well i didn't grab it from the detergent section and it didn't say detergent on it.   

no that bottle said fabric softener. not laundry detergent. no soap or cleaning agent that i'm aware of. none.   for a year and a half i've been softening the hell out of my clothing but not actually using detergent. 

i didn't want to believe it.   ran back to the laundry room at my apartment where the trash hasn't been emptied and check the old bottle.   fabric softener. 

i'm in shock. my wife has been complaining about the towels smelling for months and i thought it was in her head (i have a terrible sense of smell anyway but i knew i was washing the towels regularly) turns out i haven't washed those towels with detergent since we bought them.    she wondered why her whites always seemed dingy even when freshly washed.   well now we know.   because fabric softener... 

so now i've been washing everything i own and holy shit what a difference it makes when you actually use detergent. 



tl:dr i used fabric softener instead of laundry detergent for a year and a half, now i feel dirty and have to wash everything in my closet 


edit: a proper tl:dr


edit:   a lot of you are overusing detergent.  check the cap. the fill line for a load is usually a half inch or less above the bottom of the cap, not the top. (i see the irony of me saying this but read the label. it's pretty clear how little you actually need) 

edit3: for fucks sake people, stop telling me to not use fabric softener on towels. i didnt think i was!",4
"by hanging out alone with 5 drunk girls. so, these 5 girls asked me to come and hang out with them in their pool. 
i thought it was gonna be a little party, but no. it was just me and 5 ladies in a pool. sounds like a every mans fantasy, right? 

wrong. 

i was invited over to start up a fire pit because ""i can't do it myself"". 
so, i ask ""having a pool party, huh? yea, i can do that!"" i get a reply ""yea, a party, sure!"" 

red flag one. so, i take my happy and hopeful ass over to this house where the ""party"" is at. 

red flag two, the fire pit is already a' blazin. 

i didn't think much of it, but i also noticed that only 5 girls in a swimming pool is kind of a small party, but i'm not complaining. i settle in, have a few drinks, hop in the pool and hang out with these ladies and all seems well.... then the night actually started to take off...

one of them got super wasted, stripped down naked and was running around the house hysterically crying, while we tried chasing her down so we could clothe her. funny thing was, she was the only girl i didn't see drink alcohol. 
and like a brick wall showing up while your doing 90+ in you car, bam she was blitzed. then, another girl looked at me at one point and said ""come here, i gotta tell you a secret"" so, i swim semi-drunkenly over to hear her little secret, but instead she kisses me. i'm thinking, ""okay not what i expected but i ain't mad."" 

as i go to kiss her back i hear, in an extremely angry tone, ""what the fuck?!"" one of the other girls (the one who invited me) saw it and was irate.
she swims over to us, and i'm thinking that i'm about to be castrated, but my presence doesn't phase her, she moves straight to her friend and grabs her by the shoulder and a fistful of hair, and drags her out of the pool and onto the grass. 
they start fighting, like literally throwing fists and tackling each other on the ground, ufc style. 

but, in the blink of an eye, they stop and starting hugging each other and crying like they just saw some cheesy romantic movie with a predictable ending. i'm thinking to myself ""what the fuck. should i be aroused or terrified?!"" 

i assure you, i was both.

after that, shit got scary. they threw me into the pool, and were trying to play some wrestling game, so they held me down. now, i grew up with sisters who were rowdy, so i know how to push a lady whose trying to kill off me, but 5! in the deep end of a pool while drunk. that shit got me praying to every god in every religion. i wasn't sure if they were trying to kill me, or got caught up in the moment, i was just trying to stay alive, man. their ""playful"" laughter is something that will haunt me until my dying days. i thought it was the last thing i'd ever hear. 

then things kinda settled down, so i, cautiously and reluctantly, stayed the night on the couch because i had too much to drink and i'm not trying to get a dui or wreck my motorcycle. 
but i woke up to this god awful sound, like a beast was chowing on its prey, and i thought ""aw fuck. this is it. these ladies are a coven of witches or demons and my soul is due for atonement. my lust, my greed, i deserve this."" so, i flip around to better see what's happening, and the previously naked hysterically crying girl was vomiting everywhere. i mean really going at it. like a fire hose. 

then, after painting the floor with a fucked up rendition of blue poles by jackson pollock, she looks at me and says ""sorry, didn't mean to wake you"" and walks away. like it was nothing. then, i just closed my eyes in bewilderment, and waited until i was sober. and i got the fuck out of there.

tldr; hanging with 5 girls in a pool sounds like a dream, but it's actually a nightmare and they will get naked and try to drown you.",4
"by causing about 40 people to fall down an escalator at the airport.. okay, it wasn't today but it was recent. that's all i can give you.

i was at a uk airport and as a perk of my job i had a business class ticket to fly to brazil. i'd never flown first class before and felt pretty giddy and excited, i mean, why wouldn't i?

i was going to brazil, for 3 weeks, busines class in a five star hotel i hadn't had to pay for. to make it even better as it was technically a business trip i was getting paid to be there.

i'm heading to the departure gate and i ended up on one of those long escalators, you know the kind they have in airports that you silently note to yourself ""hey, that's a big escalator.""

i'm going down, got my backpack on, my headphones in and i'm in a good mood, such a good mood i decide to jump the last few steps, just because i'm a little giddy thinking about all those brazilian girls, some sunshine, some cheap booze and absolutely no stuffy office and intolerable moody co-workers.

so i jump, hit the plate at the bottom and the fucking thing locks up and makes a high pitched noise. it doesn't gradually come to a stop, it just stops. 

it's a busy airport, it's a busy escalator too. i turn around and see people tumbling down this thing, crashing into people and more people falling. an alarm goes off and people in uniforms come running out shouting into walkie talkies.

i try my absolute best to disappear into the crowd, another shocked bistander wondering what's going on.

i see a lady bleeding from her nose, a man with a probably broken arm, kids crying and i know it's my fault. i feel horrible, but not just horrible, worried. worried i won't be going anywhere. what will work say?!

i head to the departure gate and bored my flight without issue, the business class is severely tainted. i spend the whole trip worried i'll be arrested at the other end, every possible scenario goes through my head.

i get off scot free but i'm still feeling bad about it so i thought i'd come and tell all of you about it, so you can judge me instead.

**tl;dr don't jump the last few steps of an escalator**

"by opening an incognito tab in a board room full of managers. nsfw. a few nights ago before bed, i opened an incognito tab and used a website that should be closed immediately after. i guess i was tired so i accidentally minimized the tab instead and went to bed. a few days went on and i hadn't used my laptop (my clinical job doesn't usually require it) but yesterday i had a council meeting and had to present some work i'd been writing for the unit. i walk into a small conference room with all my managers and their bosses, ready to present. my direct manager is to my left and to my right is a guest manager from another unit. as i get ready to share my work and open my laptop, open to word, everything looks fine. i present and everyone loves the ideas, etc. and my boss asks me to write her an email summary of what i presented. i then go to click on my google app and out pops a black and orange screen with obscene scenes being portrayed. cue blushing and panic. i close it as quickly as i can and look over to my left with my direct manager who seems to be focused on something else so okay we're fine i think but then i look over to my right and the guest manager is trying to look anywhere but at me... completely red. i play it off as nothing happened and finish the meeting as best as i can but you can feel the awkward energy radiating from her. hopefully i never have to apply for a transfer to her unit... or see her again!!! 

tl;dr was giving a presentation in a board room full of managers and opened an inappropriate website in between two of them. my immediate manager didn't see but the guest to my right turned red and avoided eye contact at all costs for the rest of the meeting.",4
"by not hiding my dildo well enough. two days ago i got my first dildo. since i still live with my parents, i obviously had to hide the the sinful monstrosity. where would be the best place to hide a sex toy? perhaps up high in the corner of my closet. nah, i'm short, horny, and lazy so i didn't want to climb up there everytime i wanted to get off. 

well, under my bed the boxspring has a hole in it, perfect for objects such as a dildo. the hiding spot is set up so that when you look under the bed, you can't see the hiding spot, just the empty space underneath. 

i decide to hide my dildo, as well as a several other items of contraband (condoms and an anal plug), balanced on a piece of plywood in the boxspring. perfect place for it, why would anyone be searching under there anyways.


after i get off work, i'm greeted with a text from my mom that says, ""we need to talk.""



oh fuck, she found my dildo didn't she.


turns out, while i was away at work, my mom was searching for a pair of her shoes (that i did not have) in my bedroom. i'm assuming the bed got bumped causing the dildo to fall off the piece of plywood onto the ground, but the point is she found my veiny purple dildo. 

for context, my family's religious and i don't seem like the type that would have a dildo. 


here's a couple highlights of the conversation:


her - i found a purple dick under your bed.


me - oh really? hahahahaha


her - i haven't had sex in a long time and even i've never bought one of those.


me - oh, well if you want i could buy one for you.
i'm aware this wasn't the best thing to say, but i seem to lose any filter i have when i'm nervous


at least she chuckled at that, maybe because of shock. but it made the situation slightly more bearable. 


her - why do you have one anyways?


me - well it's just my curiosity, hormones, and i felt bad for wasting so many cucumbers.
again, another stupid thing to say but i don't think she heard. or she ignored me


then she brought up the condoms, guess a couple fell down with the toy, and asked if i was sexually active. i assured her i'm not, and that i got them because they were cheap and so that i could use it on the dildo when i didn't feel like washing it. truth is, i got them because they were colorful (pink, yellow, and green) and i thought it would be funny to whip those bad boys out if i ever do have sex. but i felt like i had embarrassed myself enough already.

she was more disappointed in me than angry. i think we both shared feelings of shame and embarrassment, but she reacted differently than i thought she would. i have no idea how i'm going to look her in the eyes tomorrow.


at least she didn't find my butt plug. 



tl;dr - bought my first sex toy a couple days ago. found a good hiding spot for it, turns out it wasn't good enough and my mom found it. don't know how i'm gonna look her in the eyes tomorrow knowing what she knows about me. also relocated my toy to the upper shelf of the closet. hid the other stuff in other places of my room. don't wanna keep all my eggs in one basket. 


edit: i am 18 and female. i bought my dildo and butt plug at the same time, i refer to my dildo as my ""first"" sex toy because i used it first. hope that clarifies some things :)



update: it's 9:30 am and i still havent seen her. she isn't even in the house 


update #2: it's noon and she's still not home. gonna give her a call.


update #3: just called her and she didn't answer. sent her a text too. haven't seen her since last night. getting kinda worried she might be avoiding me. 


update #4: just got a text back from her, i guess we're gonna forget this all happened. which is fine by me :) i'll update if she mentions it when she gets home.

"by not correcting my cashier when she mistook me for a coworker.. today was my first day off work since friday last week and i decided to run some errands. while i was out i ducked into a grocery store to buy a drink and noticed that the store's eftpos was down. the cashier told me that they could still process the sale, i just had to sign for it and the money would be taken out once it came back online. 

on my drive home i realised that i had forgotten to pick up stuff for dinner so i swung into the grocery store closest to my place, which happened to be the same brand as the one earlier. i got my stuff with no problem and went to line up at the conveyer belt and this was where my fuckup began. 

i'm a person with anxiety so i always prepare something to say when i'm inevitably asked how my day is going. i knew that i was going to respond with ""good, it's been pretty busy although i had a sleep in this morning since i was at work so late last night"". i got up to the cashier and said hello, she looked at me in surprise and went ""oh, are you not working today?"" and i just panicked. this wasn't what i had prepared for. so my stupid brain decided to go with what i had already prepared and i said ""nah i was working late last night so i'm not in today.""

the second it came out of my mouth i wanted to hit myself. why didn't i just say that i didn't work there? sure i could correct her now, but i'm already in too deep. 

so we start talking about work. she complains about having a three hour shift and how it only works out as two and a half hours pay. for some reason i say that i'm lucky that i'm not working since it looks like it's a busy day. she asks me if i've heard anything about shaun leaving. i said that i heard he is. she was upset about that, he's a nice guy. i agreed, he's one of the good ones. i have no fucking clue who shaun is. 

i manage to lie my way through the conversation, mentally berating myself but also congratulating myself on my tremendous acting skills. we get to the point where i'm about to pay and what do you know, the eftpos is down.  part of my coping for anxiety is trying to make others as comfortable and happy as possible so instead of having her freak out over the system going down, i simply explain to her how to process the sale. information i only know because i was at the other store two hours ago! 

she looks at me and goes, ""well at least someone who works here knows what they're doing."" i laugh nervously. yeah...right. 

then she asks me for my staff card to scan for ""my"" staff discount. and of course i don't have a goddamned card. who do you think i am, an employee? luckily since i had only shoved my credit card into my phone case instead of bringing my whole purse i managed to come up with a lie about how i didn't have my full purse so i don't have my card. that's alright though, she can put it through on hers and i can sign it. 

i signed a name that definitely wasn't mine. is that illegal? probably not. i then picked up my bags and ran. didn't even say bye. i needed out of there. 

as i hurried away, i heard the guy on the register behind her turn around and go, ""did you know her?""

i don't think i can ever go back there. either i'd have to attempt to keep up the pretence or go back and own up to it and face the shame. so i think i'll take option three and avoid my neighbourhood grocery store like the plague. 

tl;dr: cashier at my local grocery store mistook me for a coworker. instead of correcting her my anxiety ridden brain decided to play along. i got in deep enough that i was teaching her to process sales. after she gave me her staff discount i fled the store and now don't ever want to show my face again.

edit: wow thanks for the silver! and because a few people have asked, yes i am in therapy. i have been on and off for almost ten years. i suffered from abuse for the majority of my life and while 99% of the time i'm perfectly functioning i do still have a compulsive need for people to like me because that it something i deem safe. hence my inability to rock the boat by telling her that she thinks i'm someone i'm not. that could end in an unsafe situation and in those moments it's not a risk i'm willing to take.

edit two: and some golds! damn if i knew you guys enjoyed anxiety fueled fuckups then i'd have been sharing my dumb stories ages ago.",4
"by eating a $6,300 piece of dove chocolate. two weeks ago, i was accepted into a research study for healthy individuals to monitor the affects of a drug on their system and how long it lasts in the body.  i prepared for weeks, making sure i followed all the rules in advance.  it required 6 stays of 4 days onsite, and the restrictions were pretty lengthy - but it paid $6,300.
in the restrictions, it stated to avoid excessive amounts of a specific chemical found in chocolate and coffee, within 48 hours of the first dose.

my first dose was on a tuesday, and sunday morning, on my flight home from a work conference, i had a single piece of dove chocolate at 10am central time.  not excessive, right?  wrong.
apparently they meant - no chocolate or coffee.

as i was sitting in the research center, getting ready to settle in for a few days, they asked the question about chocolate.  i told them the truth.  the assistant left to check with the director, and came back saying it was 47hrs from the time of my dose, so i was disqualified.  i gaped at him, and said ""wait! that was 10am ct, we are in mountain time, so it's actually 48 hours!""  he left to tell his director, and they both came back.  i was still disqualified.  apparently, the last dose was possible at 8:55am.  i missed the cutoff by 5 minutes.  they wouldn't budge, and i was sent packing.

$6,300.... gone. like that.  it still hurts.  enough so, that it has taken me two weeks to write this.
at least it was dove, and tasted good.  and the funny part? the inside of the wrapper said ""you can do anything, but you can't do everything."" - shirley k maryland

edit: as i keep getting asked: this one was http://prastudies.com but search your area for paid studies, as they only have 4 locations

edit 2 for clarification answers: 

sorry, i walked away for a couple of hours and this blew up. i'm trying to answer what i can.  but the common themes:

1) i'm a woman. (no that has no bearing on my post, but it was mentioned often in the comments, so i'm clearing it up)

2) i know, i could have lied... but i kind of have a thing about lying.  especially working in the medical industry as long as i did.  lying in medicine is a major no-no.  there is a lot more than money at stake.
also, i actually thought i was in the clear.  i figured the test drug was going to be a night time pill, not a first thing in the morning pill. not to mention, excessive to me isn't a small bite of chocolate.

3) i don't work for dove, or the study group. i'm a project manager. this is truly just me screwing up.  and yes - i own my mistake. 

4) i won't be taking legal action because i truly don't believe there is any to be had.  i ate the chocolate. that's on me.  just because i don't agree with the language to which i was told to avoid it, doesn't mean i didn't still make the mistake.  also - $6,300..although a lot of quick cash, is not a lot for litigation. no point.  i'd lose more than i'd gain. this way i'm also able to continue applying for other studies going forward.  they have new ones every week.

5) they were very clear about how compensation works, and i didn't reach the point of compensation.  

6) this is not about eating dove soap. which would have been really funny i think.  a few people mentioned this is called galaxy chocolate across the pond.

tl;dr - i ate a piece of dove chocolate 5 minutes too late, and it cost me $6,300 because it was a restricted food in a research study i had joined.

"by trying to show my turtle the view from my balcony.. so i was home alone one day with me and my wife's pet turtle and i was probably drunk or super bored and lonely because i was looking at the turtle in its tank and thought it would be a good idea to bring it to the balcony to see the view. we live on the 5th floor of an apartment building and while i was carrying my little friend in my hand i rested in on the railing with my hand still securely on it. but then out of nowhere, just as i was starting to relax, it started to flail around and i lost my grip of it and i watched as it fell down 5 floors and landed shell first on my 1st floor neighbour's head. the turtle was surprisingly unscathed but my neighbour had a pretty bad concussion and i ended up paying for his medical bills.

&#x200b;

tl;dr decided to show my turtle the view from my 5th floor balcony but dropped him on my neighbour's head.

edit: since some are asking, yes the neighbour is ok. it was pretty bad at the time but fortunately didn't have any lasting effects. also turtle shells are insane.

edit 2: well fuck me this exploded. to address some people rightfully telling me that i'm an irresponsible pet owner, well you'd be right. this sub has the words ""fucked up"" in it and that's exactly what i did.

edit 3: a lot of you guys are concerned for the neighbour in the long run and trust me i am just as, if not more, concerned because it was my fault. me and him are actually cool and have a laugh about it from time to time but i do feel super bad about it and unsurprisingly, i no longer intend on showing my turtle how many cars are refilling gas across the street anymore. this is probably gonna be the final edit so thank you to everyone who was concerned for my neighbour or my turtle. or both. as to all the people calling me a fucking idiot, i don't blame you. i've brought this upon myself.",4
"by overestimating my tolerance to weed by a longshot.. tl;dr i took too many edibles, tripped out.

obligatory it was yesterday yadda yadda yadda.

so to start off i would like to say that i smoke weed about 3-4 times a week. i smoke maybe a gram, or more with friends. i have never smoked so much that i lost control of myself, or couldn't function. i have never thrown up from smoking too much, so i would like to consider myself a heavy weight. however, i had never tried edibles.

i decided to make some at home, because i like cooking, and i decided to make an omelet with canabutter. the recipe said around 4 grams of high thc concentrated grams of weed. i grow my own, and pride myself on a cannabis plant with high thc content, but 4 grams for 1 whole cup of butter and half a cup of water?!?!? that seemed absurd, and i was eating w a friend, so i used 4 grams for 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of water, thinking i will just be careful with dosing. i invited a, as in one, friend over, (let's call him jason)and we made the omelet. i added about 2 tablespoons of the cannabutter, blended and cooked for a long amount of time i might add, or approximately half into the actual egg mixture (4 eggs and a couple table spoons of sour cream w some spices). i then added a very little bit to melt on the pan, but i thought it couldn't hurt so i added more. also, the whole time i was thinking my friend would help me finish it.

i made the omelet, we dug in, and then we quickly drove to a nearby chili's because we knew they were strong, and we didn't want to drive under the influence. i got there, and barely ordered our water when everything hit me all at once. i felt like the air became corn syrup. the waitress was standing right next to me, and then i blinked, and i swear on my mother she just teleported to the other side of the table. my friend was obviously also high as a kite. it's hard to explain how high i was, and then i played some games on the little ipad they had. i sat there, and i kept thinking about how i had to say something or else it would be awkward. then i started freaking out when one of my other friends got here(i'll go with clarissa), i had invited her prior but she does not partake in weed. i forgot my jason was there, because in my mind i only had one friend sitting down w me at chili's. then i turned an saw my jason, and he was just smiling. he said he felt like there were hooks in his cheeks holding his smile up, but it felt good. i asked clarissa whether or not she felt as if the service was taking forever, but she told me she just sat down. i felt like she was gaslighting me, because i could have sworn we were there for like a  couple hours. i said i needed to take a piss, so i started walking to the bathrooms. that is when i walked into the girl's restroom. luckily nobody was there, but i was so confused until i realized it was the women's restroom due to the lack of urinals. after washing my hands in what felt like water so hot it was freezing cold i went back to my table. as i sat down, both of my friends were gone. i thought, in my state, they had somehow gotten lost at the table, i honestly don't know how but i distinctly remember thinking that i had to find them or else they would be lost forever. i found my way back to our car, and they were in there. i started knocking and telling them to let me in, but for some reason they wouldn't. sick of their shit, i started slamming, saying,"" if you fuckers don't let me in i will break this glass."" then, to my intense horror i realized this was in fact not our car, but somebody else's. i went back inside and sat down, my friends were there. they said they just watched me walk up to the table, say,"" i gotta find them."" and then walk outside. i can confidently say i was high even the next morning, which freaked me out even more. safe to say i will follow recipes to the t from now on.

edit: now i'm kinda mad i used my throwaway account for this.

edit: i get it, i'm not a heavyweight, hence my overestimation by a long shot. this has turned into a dick length contest- ""you think you're a heavyweight? i smoke 2 oz a week,"" or, "" you think you're a heavy weight? you are fucking stupid you small child, little dick, cunt. i smoke an 1/8 a day, and smoke wax constantly you fucking pussy. i also fucked your girlfriend."" like jesus calm down.

edit: many people doubt this story due to me not describing how i made the cannabutter, all i can say is that this is the story of how i fucked up, not how i made cannabutter. if you must know, yes i decarbed it (55 minutes at 220, in between foil on a baking pan) , then blended, and cooked it in a pan till it browned, dark brown close to a burnt smell, but not. i then blended it again. i didn't have cheescloth to strain, so i didn't extract the weed, just blended it in.  the strain was sour diesal. hmu w anymore questions to ""debunk"" me, i'd be happy to answer.",4
"by ripping my foreskin apart with a ceiling fan. mandatory not today but 20 years ago. 

i am 16 and horny. we didnt yet have the internet and this was still the days of searching nearby woods for scattered magazines held together by many long rains. it was also the days of waiting for your mom to go to the grocery store and using your free time to try to find literally anything new in the house to have sex with. this was one of those days. 

my mom left for the grocery store and i had an idea: duct tape a toilet paper roll filled with wet toilet paper to my penis. make sure it's really tight. then, create a rope from duct tape and wrap it around the blade of the ceiling fan. sit on one side of the ceiling fan and as the blades spin, it will pull and release the tube. brilliant. 

all starts well as i sit on a desk chair below the fan. a bit slow, but working so i turn it up. i start to notice that since there is no swivel, the duct tape is twisting and shortening. its pulling violently on my pubes and skin. i cant get the fucking thing off. fuck. i stand up to buy myself time. shut off the fan: pull the string and wait. oh fuck - still going. i'm on my tippy toes and my pubes are ripping. i pull the string and the fan begins to slow, but it's still twisting. i slam my hand into the fan to stop it. the fan breaks out of the ceiling, but i'm free.

as i unpackage my pleasure tube, i find i'd ripped a fist full of pubes out. my foreskin was twisted like an indian sunburn, checkered with blood and tears and the head of my penis is a ghostly grey.

it took 24 hours for the penis head to turn from mayonnaise to plum. my penis basically moulted over the next 3 weeks growing a new layer of penis over the old penis. i still have a long white scar down the shaft that has no feeling. 

good times. 

tl;dr: duct taped my penis to a ceiling fan and ripped my pubes and foreskin apart.

edit: changed some words.

edit: i want to be clear how this was supposed to work. i am sitting off center of the fan on a chair with my penis taped to the edge of one fan blade. the tape is slack. as the blade moves away, the take becomes taught and rips my dick right off. ",4
"by asking my wife to initiate sex. this just happened a few days ago. i've told my wife that i wished she would initiate sex more often, and last thursday she decided to oblige. i was sitting on the couch watching tv when she came out of the bedroom looking sexy the way she does. she grabbed my hands and pulled me up and started kissing me, taking a few steps back towards the doorway to go to the bedroom. we stopped a little and started undressing each other, and when it was my turn to get her pants off i dropped down real quick to get them off asap.

the next thing i felt wasn't joy in getting my wife naked, but searing pain! it turns out that i was too close to the corner of an endtable. i immediately stood up and clenched my cheeks while my wife, god bless her soul, was laughing hysterically trying to squeeze out the words, ""you took off part of your butt!""  

i ended up leaving a nice sized chunk of skin on the corner of the table. fortunately it missed my poop chute, but i have a nice inch or so long gouge near my butt bone. that hurts, in addition to the bruising of the buttocks from hitting the table so hard. my wife continued to be double\-over laughing while i was trying to stick kleenex in my crack to stop the bleeding. 4 days later and showers still suck, and i need to be careful when i'm sitting down.

tl;dr asked my wife to initiate sex, ended up taking off part of my butt on a table",4
"by eating the green paste. this happened yesterday. i got sushi with this girl after finally getting the courage to ask her out. (to those out there going through the struggle of feeling like you can't talk to someone you like, just do it. it's nowhere near as big a deal as you're thinking. don't be too proud to ask your friends for advice either.) 

anyway, this is the first time in years that i've had sushi. everything's going well as we're just talking about school until i'm so focused on what she's saying that i pick up the tasty-looking green paste with my chopsticks without any thought to what it is. 

after i throw it in my mouth and start chewing, she pauses and asks, ""did you just eat that whole thing of wasabi?"" 

i stop chewing as the spiciness kicks in, and i realize that i'm dumb as fuck. i figured it would've been gross if i just spit it out into a napkin right in-front of her so i keep chewing slowly instead. that doesn't help, so i grab the salmon with my sticks and start eating it along with the wasabi so that the taste isn't so bad. this doesn't help at all either and she can see me struggling to maintain.

""drink your tea."" she suggests.

""ah yes! liquids! they exist!"" i think to myself. 

after this only somewhat helps, i just smile, point towards the restroom, and nod my head in hopes that i at least look cute while dying on the inside. 

the door's fucking locked. 

after this i just swallow everything left, walk back to the table, and live with the flames inside my nose. the rest of the lunch was enjoyable though. will probably jokingly ask her if she wants to go for some wasabi next time.

tl;dr: wasabi. never again.

edit: i saw cars 2 once around the time it came out but hardly remembered any of it. i just watched the mater scene on youtube though and honestly i could still see myself making the same mistake had my memory of the movie been better. 

i also wanted to say many of the comments have been pretty informing as well as heartwarming. also, those of you who've tricked your family and friends into eating wasabi are straight up evil haha.",4
"by fucking myself with a stick full of maggots.. nsfl? if you're eating something then i'd suggest not reading this.

you ever seen those stories on the reddit museum of filth? like, the crusty cum shoebox or the rainbow dash figure that was boiled in a jar of cum, and realised 'why is there no female version of this?'. well, sit down because i'm about to tell you the story of how i inadvertently fucked myself... with a stick full of maggots.

&#x200b;

so, i have this pool diving stick that i use to fuck myself. i live with my parents so i can't really get an actual toy. now, this pool toy has two holes on the 'shaft' to allow water to fill in and out of it so it can sink to the bottom of the pool. this also allows it to fill with my girl juices when i use it. the problem? the fluid gets stuck in there since it's relatively more viscous than water. so i've had this thing for about 6 months. i try my best to clean it out by running it under the tap and rinsing it out every couple of weeks but i can never really get the solidly dry stuff. this, combined with the fact that i always just sort of shoved it down the side of my bed, or stuffed it in my bedside cabinet once i was done with it made for a pretty nasty smell. it wasn't usually that obvious unless you got close, but earlier today, once i had finished fucking myself, i put it in my drawer and sat up in my bed. i noticed that not only did it smelled significantly worse than usual, maybe due to the summer heat, but also 'down there' also felt like it was on fire. not enough to be painful, but enough for me to notice it.

&#x200b;

here's where the interesting part starts. i decide. 'hey, it's currently 4am, everyone is asleep, i can go and cut this thing open.' sort of like a fucked up episode of 'what's inside'. so i reach into my drawer, grab my phone and make my way downstairs into the kitchen where i clear out the sink and put this thing down in it. i use a pocket knife to start cutting it open, starting from one of the holes on the side. i'm scared to open it, but i understand that i must, and i put down the pocket knife and gently tease apart the two sides of the incision i made. 

&#x200b;

i. am. **horrified.** dozens of little maggots squirming around inside. i started gagging, until the realisation set in. 'i just stuck this thing inside of me. i may have maggots crawling around inside of my vagina right now.' the fact that they were maggots... doesn't that mean they had been there for a while? how long does it take fly eggs to hatch? in my state of panic, i snapped a quick photo (already knew that i was going to post that thing on 4chan), and rinsed out the entire thing with water, before cutting it into another 3 pieces and thoroughly rinsing them out with bleach and double wrapping them in a plastic bag and throwing it in the bin. i return to my room, disgusted, and make a 4chan post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/c6uwi5/femanon_embraces_her_inner_neckbeard/) i didn't know what to do after that, except wait for my family to wake up so i could have a shower without worrying about disturbing them. i have my shower and take a nap. that's the end.",4
"mishandling my daughters first period. i am divorced and have my two girls every other weekend. one saturday morning, my oldest girl comes in to my room and she's on the speaker phone with her mom. i hear mom say wake him up and then i wake up and address my child.

""daddy, i have my period"", she says. me: um ok. i get up. get dressed and point at my 9 y/o and say you're in charge. i'll be right back. i go to the store and faced with a sea of pads, i pick up a box of pads and a chocolate bar. my neighborhood cashier asks me if i found everything ok. i say yes.

i return home and give my daughter the bag. she asks what the chocolate is for and i confidently reply - to make you happier. i leave her to her business assuming mom has groomed her in some way for this moment.

for backup, i call up a gf and told her about what was happening and she asked specifically what i bought for her. depends undergarments and chocolate. i bought her elderly diapers. 



tl;dr my daughter has first period and i buy her elderly undergarments.",4
"by wearing the wrong underwear to my kids field trip.. everything is in the tl;dr.


this happened yesterday but i'm feeling the repercussions today. 

it started with me getting dressed and just throwing on lace underwear vs cotton. i was just staying home all day so it wasn't a big deal because after my kid leaves for school i walk around naked anyways. 

my kid reminds me that i have volunteered for his field trip and here's a list of kids that i would be watching. 

i forgot so... shit! i don't have a lunch for him or i so i threw jeans on to go run to get a lunch. i figured i could change when i got back no biggie. however... my husband text me asking for me to get some things from the store that had to be picked up immediately. 

i had no time to change and made it to the field trip 10 min late. fine, it's fine. i'll be ok. it's 75degrees, i'm in jeans, lace undies, vagina freshly shaved from the night before. i didn't think much of it. 

there's a lot of walking on this field trip though. i'm keeping up with the 8-9 year olds and i feel my underwear pull up between the lips of my vagina. so half my vagina is rubbing the lace and jeans while i walk. 

i can't fix it at any point and at this age i couldn't just adjust and lie about tucking in my shirt etc. this is the age boobs and ""lady parts"" are a big deal. 

*i did adjust at one point but my lady meat just fell out right away. 

so for three hours my vagina is rubbing against uncomfortable fabric. it's hot so my natural discharge and sweat are making it worse. i can't adjust because the bathrooms are too far away for me to leave the kids and none of the little terds had to go! 

i got home and half my vagina was rubbed raw. my husband said it looked swollen or like a big ingrown hair was forming. 

tl;dr- i shaved my vagina so had no hair buffer when my lady meat fell out of lace undies and chaffed during a three hour walk-a-thon field trip. my vagina lips are swollen and it hurts to be a functioning human.",4
"i accidentally proposed to my girlfriend waking up from appendix surgery. not really a fuck up, more just an unexpected suprise. so on friday i woke up at 7:30 a.m. with abdominal pain. my girlfriend of 7 years told me to stop moving around so much and went to work. i was rolling around for about 3 hours until i realized that my pain was getting more localized in my right lower quadrant area. since i work in the medical field i knew right away it was going to be an expensive day. so i grabbed my phone charger and went to the hospital. was immediately checked into the emergency room, got a ct scan and was told by the doctor that i needed my appendix out that day. so i was admitted into the hospital, my parents and girlfriend came. they were by my side as i went into the operating room. when i came out of surgery and was in pacu, both my girlfriend and my parents were there waiting for me. working in the medical field i knew that people my age (30 years old) say some crazy things from anesthesia but i didn't realize how crazy it was going to affect my life. when i started coming to, the drugs/anesthesia affected my judgment and i made a life-altering decision. i looked at my girlfriend, pointed to her instead, ""i want to marry you!"" right in front of both of my parents. she was in shock, so she turned to my parents and asked him if i was being serious or if it was just the drugs talking. they reassured her that i was serious because i had ""mentioned"" marriage to them in the past. so she said, ""of course i will"" and my parents said,"" welcome to the family"", then they all hugged. so yesterday i purchased her an engagement ring and the wedding planning has begun. so i guess the moral of the story is, sometimes it takes having less guts to have guts to do something?

tl;dr got appendix out, proposed on drugs, i'm engaged

edit: holy shit, front page? really? haha. a little background story, i was joking around in the comments. she waited until i was 100 percent first to make sure i really wanted to do it. i have discussed with my parents multiple times that i wanted to marry her also. my parents aren't grandbaby crazy, we don't want kids. i love my girlfriend and coming out of surgery made me realize how fragile and short life really is. no more fooling around. thanks for the gold and front page!",4
"looking after a drunk friend (nsfw). so this actually happened today. well, tonight, i mean. i've just gotten out of scrubbing myself in the shower and am ready to talk about tonight's efforts.

so i went out for dinner alone tonight. i figured that i could go catch a set of my friend's band playing and have dinner and a few quiet drinks. once out, i run into two female friends who were on the sauce. i had a few mojitos, they had a good dozen shots each. we're having a good night, i decide to head further uptown with them as they're keen for the dancing and my buddy djs at the club they were wanting to go to.

once we start walking though, things change. all of a sudden, one of the girls - let's call her amy - has all the alcohol hit her. she's barely able to stand, i end up giving her a piggyback ride the three or so blocks to the cab rank. you'd think her friend she went out with - we'll call her mary - would see this and want to put her in a cab, right? nope, she's been getting more and more pissed that i've been paying attention just to amy and wants amy to just go to the clubs with her. straight away. not after she's had a few minutes rest. right now.

luckily, we're at the cab rank at this point, mary storms off to go clubbing by herself, leaving me with an amy that can't even stand up straight. i get her in the cab and get in after her, ignoring all the glares and catcalls i'm getting from everyone around that think i'm going to take her home and molest her (welcome to australia, where if you're an ugly guy with a drunk girl, everyone immediately assumes you're about to take advantage of her).

as soon as the cab takes off, she falls asleep on my shoulder. 'excellent' i think, 'this should be easy, i'll get her to her house, then her boyfriend can look after her and i'll head back out'. within thirty seconds, she starts throwing up in her sleep. all over the cab, all over me, in my hair, in my mouth. the cabbie is justifiably furious. i hand him the cleaning fee of $150 he is demanding in order to keep driving, then when we finally get to her house he kicks us out, not before demanding another $50 for the fare (even though the meter said it was a $12.70 fare).

amy jumps out and flops face-down into the dirt before i can even get out of my side of the car. then she starts puking again. as i'm desperately trying to get her onto her side and keep her airways clear, she starts yelling at me to get her shoes off because she can't walk with them on.

which is when her boyfriend (that i've never met) opens the door and comes downstairs to see me hunched over his paralytic girlfriend, trying to take her shoes off while she's kicking and screaming to get them off so she can go inside.

luckily this guy takes a few seconds, realises what's going on and understands i'm not trying to assault his girlfriend and gets me to help carry her inside and get her into the bathtub. at this point i'm still wearing his girlfriend's vomit like the world's shittiest brand of beard oil, but once she's in the bathroom, i'm out on the street. dude does not want me around, which i suppose is fair enough. i mean, if a strange man showed up on the doorstep with my drunk girlfriend i'd be pretty pissed about the situation too.

but either way, i'm now out on the street, covered in vomit and in a strange part of town that i don't know. after wandering around lost for twenty minutes, i finally found a lift home and got a well-deserved shower. and now i'm finishing typing this story up for all you fine folks.

tl;dr - helped a drunk friend, got treated like a date-rapist, had to pay cleaning fees after she vomited all over the cab and myself, got turfed out in the middle of the night in a strange part of town still covered in said vomit.

edit: wow, i did not expect this to blow up like this. i'm at work at the moment, but i'll read what everyone has said when i get home tonight. 

but if i could ask everyone to do one small favour for me, it's go and do something nice for someone today please. betting nice feels good.  :)

2nd edit: thank you for the gold, kind strangers!

3rd edit: now that i'm home i can actually read through the thread and wow, there's a lot here. for all those who have given kind words, thank you so much, it's super appreciated. for everyone asking why i posted the story, it was really only because i've read so many stories on here that have made me laugh, shocked me or made me feel for the people writing them, i honestly just hoped that maybe one or two people might have gotten a little chuckle out of it before it got deleted by the mods/faded into reddit history. it certainly wasn't to big up myself or try to shame anyone. it has been interesting to read all the different responses here though.

and for the people who wanted to know how the vomit got in my mouth, that was when we were in the cab sitting next to each other, she put her hand over her mouth while vomiting and some of it splashed/squeezed out the side, right onto my face as i was apologizing to the taxi driver. absolutely a fluke shot, i guess if dude perfect ever want to do vomit videos she could get a job with them, haha.

for the people asking about lyft/uber, for the most part in australia they are only in the capital cities. i live in a regional town in queensland of about 60,000 people, neither of those companies are expanding here any time soon unfortunately.

i spoke to both the girls briefly today and they're certainly feeling more than a little embarrassed (and hungover). amy has offered to transfer what she can now and will pay me back the rest on thursday when she's paid. she's a good egg.",4
"by enraging the parents of my girlfriend by pretending not to know what a potato is.. let me tell you that i have made a bad mistake this evening. 

my girlfriend (who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time) said i am ""invited to dinner"" with her and her parents. i was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. but i knew it must be done. 

i met them nicely, i should tell you, and it started off in a good way. the idea slapped my mind that i should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing. 

when i saw that baked potatoes were served i got the idea that it would be very good if i pretended i did not know what potatoes was. that would be funny.

well let me tell you: backfired on my face. i'll tell you how. 

so first when the potato became on my plate, i acted very interesting. i showed an expression on my face so as to seem that i was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. they did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. so i asked ""this looks very interesting. what is this?"" 

they stared at me and the mother said ""it's a baked potato.""  and i was saying ""oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?"" 

and she was like ""a potato."" 

and i was like ""a 'potato', oh interesting. never heard of a potato, looks pretty good."" 

and then they didn't see i was clowning, but thought i really did not know what is a potato. so i knew i would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if i admitted to making a bad joke, so what i did was to act as if it was not a joke but i committed to the act of pretending i didn't know what a potato is. 

they asked me, very incredulous, did i really not know what a potato is? that i never heard of a potato. i went with it and told them, yes, i did not ever even hear of a potato. not only had i never eaten a potato i had never heard the word potato. 

this went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my ""fucked up antics"", and then the more insistent i was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking i did know what a potato was.

well let me tell you i had to commit 100% at this point. when i would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. at one point he said something like ""enough is enough. you're fucking with us. admit it.""  and i said ""sir, before today i never heard of a potato. i still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. i don't know what to tell you."" 

well let me tell you he got very annoyed. i decided to take a bite of the potato, and when i did i made a high pitched noise and said ""taste's very strange!"" 

that is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying ""what are you doing?"" and my girlfriend went to some other room. 

finally the father said i should ""get the fuck out of his house"" and i said it was irrational to treat me like this just because i never heard of a potato before. well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. 

now in text messages i have been telling my girlfriend i really don't know what a potato is. the only way i can ever get out of this is for them to buy that i don't know what a potato is. 

i wish i never started it but i can't go back. i think she will break up with me anyway. ",4
"by losing weight and hanging out the washing.. so this actually happened maybe ten minutes ago.

bit of context. my neighbours are extreme curtain twitchers. our back gardens are currently open to each other since a fence blew down and neither of us has the money to replace it just yet.

i'm a big guy, about 6ft1 (186cm) and i've been heavy for some time but when the scales touched 25 stone (350 lbs, 160kg ) i figured it was time to do something. so i've been eating better and losing some weight. i haven't lost much but it's enough to make my clothes' waistbands irritatingly unable to stay put.

today i'm lounging in some loose comfortable pants (soft material made for lounging or sleeping - decorated with dangermouse for anyone who cares) which are quite old with little elastic left in the waist. the wife is out with the kids and i'm getting on with some work. i've already had a strange interaction with next door neighbour (check it out over on choosingbeggars if u like.)

this being britain, the sun quickly disappears and i hear the rain begin. ""oh no"" i think, ""the washing is out on the line and if it gets wet again i won't hear the end of it."" so i head out and go to bring in the washing, i reach up for the first piece and my slightly smaller than usual waist betrays me. my arms are in the air unclipping pegs and my pants slide down. now the unfortunate side is that i am also blessed with an arse and hips unable to keep pants up (thanks mam). i can't stop them without dropping washing on the now wet ground. 

you guessed it, those soft comfy pants are now heading for my knees, taking my also loose boxer shorts with them. my package is now floating free and easy in the late summer breeze.

i rapidly fold up the item of clothing and shove it in the bag, and go to yank my pants up, when i suddenly lock eyes with my neighbour. she's there at her window, twitching aside her blinds, ogling my junk. might have only been a fraction of a second but it felt like hours we looked at each other through that window for.

now this woman is in her sixties and lives next door with her son, both of whom i'm fairly sure have learning disabilities. we've had several strange interactions with them over the years, but i think her viewing my cold-shrivelled pecker dangling in her window is possibly the worst.

i'm sure the wife will howl with laughter when i tell her. 

tldr: lost weight recently causing my pants to fall down while collecting hung washing, exposing myself to a nosy neighbour.

edited to fix an autocorrect.

update: well this seems to have entertained far more people than i was expecting. thanks for the silvers. i find it amusing my first awards are for public indecency. just happy i could brighten so many people's day. i tried to reply to as many as i could but it's bed time now.

for those who are wondering, the wife laughed just as i suspected she would. many thanks for all the kind words for the weight loss, and the pointers to the belts (not that they go with lounge pants but work trousers or jeans are just as disobedient right now).

finally, i'm sorry i can't tell you where to get dangermouse pants these days. i bought mine from asda (uk version of walmart) around 4 or 5 years ago and haven't seen them anywhere since.",4
"by not hiding my sex bag. i had decided to reorganize my room some time ago and only made it about halfway through. my mom thought she would be nice and help clear out the clutter. amongst my crap was the sex bag. what's a sex bag? i'm not sure if anyone else has been so clever, but i decided it would be easiest to have all the sex equipment my so and i use in one central location, or one plastic grocery bag. you know, condoms, lube, wet wipes, etc.

i came home yesterday to find my room empty and sex bag relocated. she said nothing but it was clear she had seen and moved it. we're kind of even because she recently bought a vibrator on the family amazon prime account and accidentally used my credit cards. there is now an unspoken agreement between us to not mention it. my so and best friend had a good laugh at my embarrassment. just remember to hide your sex bags better.

"by accidentally getting my dog super, super high and incurring a $2000 vet bill before i figured out what happened.. so, before i start i want to acknowledge that i am a terrible terrible person and an irresponsible pet parent. i'm pretty much posting here because i expect reddit to tear me to pieces and i think i deserve it. everyone i tell this story to irl just laughs :(

this didn't actually happen today, it happened on friday. i was in my pool throwing balls for one of my dogs, while the other watched (he doesn't like the pool, only smelly ponds will do for swimming). his name is leo, and he is a one-year-old border collie. bouncy and adorable and loving.

he lays down by the side of the pool and i swim over to pet him. he stays lying down. this is not normal for leo. he is an excitable dog. every moment is play time. if i twitch at 3am it's omg play time now?! no leo go back to sleep. so i start calling his name and acting excited. stays lying down. barely opens his eyes. i start to worry, so i get out and walk back to the house. he can barely walk. stumbling and falling to the side. i start freaking out. i get him inside and he lies down on the floor and doesn't move. he's conscious, he hasn't collapsed, but all he'll do is open his eyes and look at me he won't get up willingly. so obviously at this point i'm freaking the fuck out. could be heatstroke, it was a warm day. but there were no signs of it, he had plenty of water and shade, and he wasn't vomiting at all. 

so i take him to my vet. they agree he's not right and want to admit him over night. but they don't have staff there overnight and i'm worrying my brains out, so i take him to the emergency vet about 40 mins away where they have 24 hour staff. i get him settled there, and then they call me and tell me they really can't work out what's wrong, all his tests are normal. not dehydrated, liver and kidney function are fine. heart rate's a bit slow but not terribly. but he won't wake up and if he's forced to walk he falls.

so they say they're really worried about him, and they want me to take him to the specialists about an hour away. i inwardly cry, because my other dog has had a stay there before and it's expensive. but a pet parent's gotta do what a pet parents gotta do. so off we go.

we get to the specialist. it's about midnight by this point. i'm exhausted and tearful with worry. they admit him and send me home. over the next few days, he has every test known to man. all normal. he has about 10 different neurological exams. normal. he seems to be slowly improving day by day. on monday they say i might as well take him home, he seems to be improving and they're waiting on some more tests results. basically, there's nothing they can do right now that i can't do at home.

over and over again they've asked if he could have gotten access to any toxins. and over and over again i say no. nothing. he's been with me all day. i can't think of anything he could have gotten into.

then on monday it hit me. i had been cleaning out the outside freezer, and caught him with his head in the trash bag. i shooed him away and thought nothing of it. it was just old food with freezer burn. nothing that could hurt him. then i remember. i used to store edibles in that freezer. strong edibles. my first batch before i figured out doses. one chocolate would knock me on my ass for a day. my usual dose was 1/4 a chocolate.

he must have eaten one. the poor little fucker was high as a kite for three days.

happy to say it's been five days now and he's right as rain. currently demanding i throw balls for him in spite of a three hour walk this morning.

but ... fuck. i feel fucking terrible. i poisoned my dog :( poor little dude.

"by not checking my shorts before putting them on.. background - my lady love (ll) and i live in a house built in the early 1900's with mostly original everything, including the sliding no screen having windows.  we typically only crack the windows or put in temporary screens when fully open due to not wanting the cat to get out.  further, while sleeping i'm typically in the buff unless we have visitors over - story time!

talk about an amazing weekend... the northwest weather has been treating us well lately.  saturday we went golfing, rode bikes to go eat and play some pinball, then basically enjoyed each other's presence for the remainder of the day.  sunday morning was starting off no different.  looking forward to a quick walk and talk over some caffeine then commencing with our normal costco run and likely some yard work, etc.

time to get up!  after handling some normal morning routines i head to the bedroom while ll finishes her routine in the bathroom.  i try to respect the neighbors by putting on some clothes while walking around downstairs with the blinds open.  the first thing i see are my adidas basketball shorts from the early years (these things are over 15 years old and still going strong - love em!).  i pick them up, put them on, then hop on the bed and decide to take a tour of reddit.... here we go.....

not 10 seconds later i feel that initial sensation you get when an itch creeps up, but on the base of the head of my dick.  (this all feels like slow motion)  i reach down to itch it and from the time i start moving my hand to the time i reached my dick the feeling went from itch to fire..  so instead of itching i pulled my dick out to observe for any visual signs of concern.  i didn't really see anything... the pain is increasing!!

at this point i throw my shorts off and as soon they hit the ground i hear ""bzzzzzzzzzzzzzbbzbzz"".   

me: ""babe!!!!""  

ll runs in asking what's wrong. 

me:  ""i think a bee or wasp stung my dick!""

ll:  ""wth do you mean a bee or wasp stung your dick!?!""

i pointed at the buzzing shorts.  after regaining a bit of my composure i hammer fisted the shorts and confirmed that yes, yes in-fact a wasp was in my shorts and stung my dick.  

let me say one thing, i consider myself a fairly intelligent person but ll out does me here and in many other areas.. it's one of the main reasons i adore this lady.  either way, aside from being a smarty pants ll doesn't handle high stress situations very well.  at this point my eyes are bugged out and she can tell i'm a bit concerned about my dick.  she grabs her phone and googles ""wasp sting dick"".  really.... anyways, she ends up finding stories about other people's dick's getting stung and is laughing... she's lost god damn site of the mission.  

me:  ""babe.... maybe just look up wasp sting treatment""

ll:  ""ohhhhhh yeahhhhhhh - sorry""

wasp treatment - clean with soap, treat with vinegar for 15 min, and then ice.

cleaning with soap - check!  ll brings me a glass of white wine vinegar....

ll: ""to soak your dick....""

i have to walk into the office and close the door because i'm so damn embarrassed that i'm soaking my dick in a good drinking cup full of vinegar.  15 minutes pass and i go shower.  pain is all but gone and there is no swelling.

as i sit here typing this up i can still smell the vinegar on my finger and can only imagine how bad my dick smells.  this little bastard isn't going to ruin my day; i have his corpse in a sandwich baggy and he will be going with us to costco and our other adventures.  this is just in case my dick swells to the size of a grapefruit or something.  

well, thanks for listening and don't forget to check your shorts!

tl;dr - put my shorts on without checking and got my dick stung by a wasp.",4
"by seeing how fast i could go before a grasshopper slid off my windshield. today i was sitting at a local redlight i know all too well when bam! what do i see? a poor, unsuspecting grasshopper staring back at me from the other side of the glass. i shoot him a quick flick clicking the windshield in the process but it only ends in a throbbing fingernail. grasshopper unphased.

time for plan b. as the light turns green, i survey the surroundings and giddily determine that the coast is clear, passionately pushing the pedal plum into the floorboard, revving my v4 for all she's worth, vrooom! 10mph...15mph....my new buddy isn't budging. as several more seconds pass and 20 turns into 25..30..35..40! oh crap. blue lights. i stoically pull over, glaring at the grasshopper one last time while awaiting my fate. he smirks back with those squinty little eyes.

uh, yes sir, i do know it's a 25 mph school zone. why was i speeding? well, tbh i was seeing how fast i could go before that grasshopper would slide off. cop follows my gaze to the grasshopper... looks back at me. back at the smirking grasshopper. 4 seconds of suspenseful anticipation pass and as i'm frantically trying to come up with a better excuse, the officer interrupts my thoughts by dying with laughter. i nervously chuckle back and gratefully press onward with my business.

tl;dr got pulled over because a grasshopper made me do it. wouldn't leave no matter how fast i went ",4
"by applying for jobs with the windows 10 mail app for a year.. finally, i get to post one of these! and bonus, it happened today! this is pretty much the only bright side to the whole thing, sadly.

because i am human, i enjoy money, and i decided quite a while ago that i wanted more of it, so i started applying for other jobs. also, because i live in the 21st century, and you can't just wander into a building and instantly become the manager anymore, i've been doing all of these applications online. so, being the good little applicant that i am, i made sure my cv was perfect and up-to-date, and made sure to write a personalised cover letter for every single job i applied for. i thought i was doing a pretty good job, except for the fact that over the past few months, i haven't even been getting any rejections any more, much less positive replies or interviews.

this continued on for several months, and all the while, my self-esteem started to plummet. a whole bunch of idiots from my high school have decent jobs! i see them on facebook! how come i can't get one? last week, trying to be a little less direct in my approach, i decided to email a whole bunch of recruitment agencies too...and even they didn't reply. what? i could be making you money, guys! don't just ignore me! what are you, every girl i ever knew until age 17?

the fact that they didn't reply stirred up my curiosity. my cv is saved as a word document, but i use an alternative program. maybe the formatting is getting messed up and making me look unprofessional, and i can't see it on my pc? so, i decided to email my girlfriend to test it...using the windows 10 mail app. as i have been since probably last july.

i sent her an email with the cv attached, and the subject ""test"". this is what she received.(http://i.imgur.com/0vgvady.jpg) no attachments or anything. i then decided to try using the browser version of gmail, which i haven't done in a long time. it worked perfectly.

7 fucking months, microsoft. 7 goddamn shitty fucking months since i've had a job interview. eat a fucking bouquet of dicks.

"by sending nudes and getting cyber-blackmailed. so i'm 21 years old with a platinum edition v card. i have been trying online dating since i am somewhat of an introvert. i had only ever had 2 dates with girls i met online and they were nice, but it didn't work out. oh well. about 2 hours ago at the time of writing this i met a girl on pof who had her kik username in her profile saying to contact here there because she doesn't use pof much. i messaged her expecting another bot but to my surprise, it was a real woman. we talked for a bit and she gave off a really flirty vibe. made me believe she was into me. this is where things started escalating... quickly...

after talking for a bit we were flirting a little and she asked me if i was horny. i jokingly said ""always lol wbu?"" to which she replied ""lol same here."" a minute later she sent me a back-to-the-mirror nude (with the kik camera so i knew it was real), and asked for one back, specifically asking for my ""face and dick,"" and that she'd pose however i wanted if i did. i agreed, and sent it. she replied ""you're so hot <3"" and i said she was too (because she was). she sent me a full frontal next and then said, ""so what do you want to see now?"" i gave my suggestion. this is where my heart sank.

the next 3 pictures she sends me are pictures of my family and i. she found me online. she showed me my full list of contacts on facebook and this immediately transformed from a late night sexy chat session to full on cyber blackmail. she said that unless i cooperated with her then she would send the pictures i had sent her to everyone on my contacts list. she then showed me screenshots of her doing it to someone else to prove she wasn't messing around. my family and i are christians, and we were a very close family. i couldn't even bear the thought of them seeing the shameful things i had been sending and saying. i was trapped. or at least i thought i was.

in defeat asked her what she wanted. and she told me that i was going to sign up to her websites. i asked how many and she said don't worry about it. just focus on this first one. she sends me a link saying, ""make sure you register through the link i sent you."" i said ok let me just get on my pc, but she told me to do it on mobile. i wasn't about to argue. i clicked the link, and it was a deep web hookup site that most of us have never heard of. one of those sites where they use your cc info for your ""free"" registration for age verification. here's where i started to actually think with my \*\*head\*\* and not with my ""head.""

i managed to convince her that i was working on the site and that fraud detection was blocking my card from the site (because that does happen) and for her to wait. she said to hurry up. i spent this time screen shooting everything we had said and sent to each other, including the photos of her. i was speed researching what to do in this situation legally, all while trying to figure out how i was going to explain nude pictures of me to my family, because there was no way i was putting my card on the deep web. i gathered all the information i could on her and told her that i wasn't doing it. she said ""ok. goodnight."" a minute later, she sends me a picture of her sending my nudes to my dad over facebook im.

i try to collect myself for a minute, but i can't. it's 3 a.m., but this was an emergency, so i called my mom. no answer. i leave her a voicemail explaining my situation and hung up. i called my dad. thank god almighty he picked up. i explained my situation to him trying my best not to burst into tears because i could only think of how disappointed my parents were going to be with me for the rest of my life. i underestimated them. my mom was there too and they said how i should proceed with taking my personal stuff off the web, and that they were not going to hold this over my head. they comforted me when i expected them to berate me for being so stupid. they showed me only love and understanding when i expected the opposite, and i almost burst into tears.

i am so blessed to have such a loving family. i won't be touching online dating again after this is all over.

tl;dr: i shared nudes with a girl and was cyber blackmailed. my sanity was saved by the love and understanding of my family.",4
"by probably ruining a girl's life, forever, via capture the flag.. today i fucked up. there's a girl in my ecology class. let's call her ""madge"". madge is your go-getting try-hard holier-than-thou know-it-all with an unchanging facial expression i can only describe as ""cat trying to shit a peach pit"". one of those constant-frowners, and constant-downers. 

i even tried to get along with madge at the start; i'd sit by her and try to engage her (read: humor her) with conversations in relevant topics about ecology, such as the thrilling handedness of apes or edge-of-your-seat songbird plumage complexity, but just trying to be civil was a futile endeavour. expecting madge to be civil with you because you were civil with her is like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn't eat it. madge was born to be an asshole.

everything you said to her was met with a ""pffft"", or a dramatic roll of the eyes, and a quick retort such as ""well, if you'd actually *read* carter et al. 2007, you would have known that..."" she had to be better and smarter than everyone, at everything, all the time. and boy, that shit got real old, real quick. so i stopped sitting by her. and began to loathe her. with a pre-occupied disposition. i thought about her twice today before even writing this, that's how much i don't like her.

fast forward to the first capture the flag game of the year. being a freshman, i thought i'd attend as a way to get out of my residence room and meet some people. the first game was at about 8:00pm, the campus was already dark, and i showed up just wearing shorts and a t-shirt. out of 150+ people (who knew capture the flag was so popular?) i ended up being possibly the most under-dressed person there. camouflage, ghillie suits, face-paint, and black morph costumes were just some of the norm. this was like capture the flag olympics. 

teams were divided into short sleeve vs. long sleeve, and the ""flags"" were two bicycle lights. i began to mingle with fellow short-sleeves... and that's when i saw her. madge. black boots, black pants, black turtleneck, black scarf, black cap, black gloves. she was going all call of duty for this game -- of course. why wouldn't she be a try-hard at capture the flag too? and i just knew i'd have to tag her the fuck out. this was my chance to prove i was better at something.

the first few rounds, us short-sleeves did terribly because no one stayed behind to defend, so we lost 3 rounds promptly. each time they blew the whistle, i could hear madge laughing. i could hear it. so i switched to defense. to prevent ""camping"", there was a 50 meter buffer around each ""flag"". conveniently for me, there was a group of hedges 50 meters away from my flag. so i hid in the hedges.

each time anyone from the other team tried to sneak up to our flag, i'd jump out of the hedges, startle the hell out of them, and that would give me the time i needed to run up and tag them out. i'd probably tagged out 8-10 people in about 15 minutes, when the stars aligned, and i saw her. madge. walking through the shadows along the side of a building, headed straight for our flag, thinking she was so sneaky with all her matching black gear. this was it. it was *my time to shine*.

but i was too excitable. i bounded from the hedges like sea biscuit while she was still a good 40-50 feet away. so i yelled ""aaaaarrgh!"" to try to emphasize the startling effect. she shrieked in surprise, but without missing a beat, she spun around 180 degrees and headed back for her ""side"" at a dead sprint. i then realized that if she got to her side before i caught her, she'd be ""out of play"" and i couldn't tag her out -- that was an impossible embarrassment, i couldn't allow it. i took off too, at a dead sprint. like gimli, i'm not so much for long runs, but dangerous across short distances. i was gaining on her, and now confidently puffed up, with a laugh i shouted ""you can run if you want, i'll just catch you when you're tired!""

the chase lasted probably 100-150 feet before she tripped on a tree root and fell pretty hard, but made no attempt to get back up. as i got closer, i realized she had stooped to a whole new low - playing the crying game, surely exaggerating an injury that would thus make my ""tagging"" of her distasteful. but then as i got closer still, i realized she was *really* crying, like *hysterically* crying. i was still mad, so as i got up to her i said ""crying won't fucking help"", at which point she rolled on to her back and looked up at me and shouted ""get the fuck away!"". i leaned down to make eye contact and said ""it's just a fucking game"", to which she cocked an eyebrow and said ""what the fuck are you talking about?!""

and then it hit me.

i did not recognize this girl.

*this was not madge.*

this was some girl walking to the bus station after a night class.

horrified, mouth hanging open, the rolodex of my mind spun as i suddenly imagined what it must have been like from her perspective: a large, strange, bearded, sweaty, under-dressed man jumped out of the bushes screaming ""aaarrrrrrrgh!"", and when she ran, he ran too, screaming ""you can run if you want, i'll just catch you when you're tired"", and when he saw her crying, said ""crying won't fucking help"".

i wanted to apologize, i wanted to introduce myself, i wanted to explain, but all i could get out was ""hey... sorry -- it was, it's just... hi, i'm... hey, you know, capture the flag?... please don't call the police, this was all a misunderstanding"" and then i ran away hoping she hadn't seen enough of my face to create a composite sketch for campus security.

i never ended up tagging her, or madge for that matter, and i never went back to capture the flag after that (i hear it may be getting cancelled) but i probably caused some seriously deep-seated anxieties about night classes that will haunt that poor girl forever.

dear night class girl, if you're a redditor, i am so sorry. i'm actually a pretty nice guy, really.

tl;dr - today i fucked up by wanting to get back at a snooty know-it-all from ecology class by chasing her down at a night game of capture the flag only to realize i'd chased down (and probably subsequently scarred) some girl from night class who wasn't even playing.

**edit:** wow, thanks for the reddit gold, guys - i'd say ""you surprised me and popped my gold cherry"" but that expression would seem to be in poor taste after my story. 

**edit:** i never realized how much i made it sound like she broke her neck at first. holy shit. also, i laughed my ass off at how many people say there's sexual tension between me and madge. fucking madge.      ... but maybe there is tension. maybe i am in love with her... holy shit my whole life has been a lie! jk lol i really still hate her.

"by bringing my sunscreen on a disneyland ride. (actually two weekends ago.)

so i was in nyc for the us open and this hospital had a booth handing out free small bottles of sunscreen! great, because as a man without a purse i think most of the sizes in the store are annoying to carry. also, it came with a little belt loop metal ring thing, so i could just attach it to my pants and look super cool.

couple days later i'm at disneyland with my sunscreen attached. when i got onto the thunder mountain ride, i didn't realize the sunscreen bottle was being squeezed between my leg and the safety bar until after it was over and it basically looked like i enjoyed the ride way too much. all over my crotch and the seat.

i didn't have the integrity to make eye contact with any of the employees or check if the people behind me got into the ride. i just booked it out of there and even after washing off my shorts i had a massive grease stain on my crotch all day.

"by thinking my new headset was broken for 6 months.. i bought a new razer kraken headset about 6-7 months ago, and at the time i didn't realise that there was a volume wheel. so i started to use it when i realised that it felt so quiet, so i unplugged them and put my shitty sony headphones back in. 

a couple of days later i plugged the headphones back in, to see if anything had changed, nothing. so i searched it up on the razer forums, there were fixes but nothing worked. so i tried to use it in game when i bent over to get a can of coke of the ground, when i accidentally turned up the volume wheel, not knowing i had done this, i thought it was awesome. but about an hour later, somehow i accidentally turned it back down, and i thought it had broken itself again.

skip ahead six months or so, and i plug them in again because why not, and i realise there's a volume wheel. i turn it up, working. good as new. and i spent the rest of the day feeling like the biggest idiot.

"by letting brain go automatic at the gym.. obligatory this-happened-last-week disclosure.

when i go to the gym, i put in my earphones and let the music absorb me. it eases the rest of the workout because it all feels like one swift process, and my brain goes on automatic, reflexively doing everything without strong conscious focus from me. that's usually not an issue, but, well...

it was time for my chest workout and i spotted a pair of benches lined up together, with the heads right against one another. one of them was free, and the other was occupied by a dude. now, this man was something. he looked like he was the sole supreme warrior of all the lands of pakistan. biceps and triceps bulging so much they look like they aboutta spill onto the ground and start lifting weights themselves. likely eats the equivalent of a hindu holy cow in his daily protein shakes.

fully absorbed by sia's chanting in my ears, i walk over. routinely, i remove the clamps and weights of the previous user on my bar and start searching for some 5kg weights. i take a few steps around, eyes scanning the floor and many racks for them, and my eyes finally set on a nice, jungle-green pair sitting on a rack. dutifully, i start removing the clamp on the rack as to reach the 5kg weight, with only a small, nagging voice in the back of my head wondering, *""why is there a clamp on this rack?""* and began to pull out the weight.

and then, it happened.

the enchanting harmony of sia's voice was penetrated by a booming, **hey!**

my hands freeze, and my neck cranes upwards to see commander pakistan himself lying down on his bench, looking ready to start his bench press with his hands gripping the bar above him, which just so happened to line up perfectly with the rack i was dealing wi— oh. that's when it dawned on me. the ""rack"" i was pulling weights off was, in fact, the bar he was using, and i was about to casually give this guy a serious injury had he lifted the bar, ignorant to my oblivious meddling.

i ripped out my earphones, threw my hands back, and immediately started to apologize. initially, i saw only trickles of smoke toot out the ears of our south asian demi-god—indicating he was only slightly pissed; later he seemed to find it funny, even cordially giving me tips for my workout. very chill guy.

but damn, boys and girls. my automatism could've seriously injured someone, and boy did i fu.

"by having a really high pain tolerance.. so bonus points because this actually happened today but the story starts about a week and a half ago. 

day one: i am lactose intolerant, and i had a stomach ache, no big deal i probably ate something i shouldn't have. no harm done.

day 4: stomach ache is still there. i'm a medical professional, i realized that my abdomen on my right lower side was what hurt. wrote it off as having too much ice cream.

day 6: i thought to myself it could be appendicitis, but i shrugged it off because appendicitis is supposed to be super painful right? this was like 4/10. 

day 7:  i realized i had a lump near my anus, i thought huh that's not good, probably just a hemorrhoid, i've had a few before no biggie.

day 9: this hemorrhoid is the most  painful one i've ever had, 6/10 i'll pick up some cream and advil long lasting relief capsules from target should be able to push right through.


day 11:  i start my vacation tomorrow and am going out of town, (i work in a hospital for context) well that hemorrhoid is really starting to hurt at this point, like a 7/10. so i go work thinking okay i can get a doctor to look at the hemorrhoid and give me some ointment or steroids. 

well i'm not having a vacation now, because i'll be in the hospital for a few days. apparently my appendix ruptured a week ago and i just figured it was a stomach ache. turns out that hemorrhoid was actually pain from the appendix ruptured radiating. the doctor told me that if i didn't come to the hospital within the next couple of days i'd be dead. 

tldr; having a high pain tolerance finally has a downside, didn't realize my appendix blew up until way too late. ruined my vacation.

sorry for format i'm on mobile, i'm also on dilaudid and morphine (one then the other) so please go easy on me. credit to my girlfriend who begged me to go to the hospital before vacation, i was going to hold off till after a 2 week vacation that i would have died on.


update: so i had a few people question why i felt pain by my anus and how was a lumped formed? so i talked to a surgeon who finally spend the time explaining it, when my appendix ruptured it caused everything else to inflame. the lump i was feeling was pus caused by the colon and gravity causes it to go down.



update 2: apparently i have crohn's disease :/ lots of pain at the moment. i'll update once everything is for sure.",4
"by grunting while getting a blowjob. so i'll start by saying that this happened years ago while i was still a teenager in high school.

i was dating a lovely lass, we'll call her amanda, for just over two months. her family went on a yearly trip to a roller coaster theme park.  it was roughly three hours away.  they invited me along and offered to pay for everything.  honestly it was a great time.

 we left for our trip at around 2:30-3:00a.m. so we slept sitting in the back seat for most of the ride.  the park was a blast. short lines, decent weather.  there from open to close. afterwards we stayed the night in a holiday inn and left in the morning to return home. 

we were riding in amanda's dad's company car. it was a white 2005 cadillac sedan.  it was roomy but still not so much as to lay down unimpeded while sharing the back seat. amanda's parents were in the front. her dad was driving and she decided she was ready to nap. she put her head in my lap facing me and curled up in the rest of the bench style seat. 

she rested awhile but i guess she got bored and decided to play a road trip game to pass the time.  i wasn't aware we were going to play.  amanda started sneakily caressing my manhood with the hand under her ""snoozing"" head. i responded physiologically rather soon, as teenage boys will do, and quickly outgrew my pants.  

now, of course, i was nervous. i could see her parents and was occasionally engaging in small talk. through the rearview mirror they could check back and see my face but not much lower. amanda was wearing a hoodie with hood up and was laying mostly still.  all of this only added to the excitement though.  the risk was a reward to my adolescent mind and i sincerely doubted any repercussions.  

anyways, my pants had seemingly shrunk and amanda, having noticed my discomfort, took it upon herself to free me of their constraint.  now feeling the fresh air was a relief but risk increased exponentially and so did the thrill.  amanda must've felt exactly the same way.  so with thrill increased the obvious solution was to hide my exposed member in her mouth. i was not against this one bit. however i did have to bite my lip to stifle any verbal agreement to her action. 

we may have been young, and maybe because i was young, but amanda was a goddess from the lips in. every move she made was the exact right move.  there's something alpha and strange about seeing the back of someone's head while exploring the back of their daughter's head.  

so there i am.  trying to look natural in case they use the rearview mirror.  biting my lip, eyes wide open, mostly holding my breath.  looking natural.  there she is. looking asleep.  head slowly bobbing.  wet, soft, occasional, gagging noises.  normal sleep stuff. i'm starting to get close.  like three minutes in.  severe lasting power for my teenage self. 

we had developed little signals for this situation.  the orgasm situation.  not the blown near parents situation.  worked for both thankfully.  little double tap on her shoulder to alert her of incoming baby babies. lucky for me she was of the habit of consuming these salty potentials. which also was advantageous to this situation.  

here's the fuck up.  i'm starting to climax.  trying to summon lady gaga's best poker face. holding my breath and turning red. i imagine my eyes rolled up into my skull for a brief moment because everything went black. i uttered a single soft grunt. the pivotal fuck up was less than a syllable. i re-focused on the mirror to find her father quizzically looking at me.  in less than two seconds, i'm not even through my throes, i fucked this entirely enjoyable situation up. with less than a syllable. 

i saw realization come across his eyes. followed by anger. i hear a mutter of, ""wtf?"" i try to pull her head up just a bit. she slams back down in an attempt to contain catastrophe. however some little bit of catastrophe escaped.  a dime sized drop of milk gooey catastrophe landed just behind her hood. in plain sight of dad. 

risk or danger tend to make sexual events that much more exciting.  it makes them feel explosively more intense.  getting caught does not feel that way.  it's like coming to the brink of orgasm and then getting shot in the nutsack with a bb gun after the first gush. 

that little dime sized bit of full confirmation meant that i had to find my own way home.  no yelling. no berating. just, ""get out."" and i did just that. 

tl;dr

i got head in the back of a car that was being driven by the girl's parents and was caught just as i finished.

"by going on a date thinking it was a job interview. by sitting through an entire date thinking it's a job interview

so this happened in the past 24hrs. 
i'm a 19 year old male making my way through college, and also work at a restaurant to make ends meet. now you could consider me pretty smart except when it comes to social interactions, i can almost never pick up on little hints such as flirting. 

so yesterday was a pretty slow day at the restaurant and this middle aged lady (35-40) came in, she was the only customer we'd had all day, and as such i decided i'd be extra friendly and have a real conversation with her.

it's worth noting that she's very very attractive for her age, and she was very well kept as well.
during the conversation she mentions that she runs a property management/realtor business, and that she had just spent the day interviewing people for an assistant position she had open. but she hadn't found anyone worth hiring yet, then proceeds to ask me if i knew anyone looking for a job. 

now i'm happy with my job, the money is decent (could be better ofc) but i'd always wanted a desk job. so i told her i was actually thinking of looking for another job. she then proceeds to say that ""i look like the perfect young man for the job"" and that she would like to talk about it more when i wasn't at work. so we made plans to meet the next morning for coffee. 

now here's where my idiocy really becomes clear. 

im not usually a morning person and the idea of an early morning interview had me nervous, so i made sure i woke up nice and early and got dressed looking real spiffy if i may say so.

i show up to the cafe dressed formally with my resume in hand. and as soon as she spots me she greets me with a long deep hug. this is when i should've realized this wasn't a standard job interview. but clueless as i am i just figured oh shes friendly. 

we sat down and the conversation never once broached the subject of my skills, qualifications, or employment history. instead she mainly steered the conversation towards personal stuff like what are my hobbies, shared stories about her life etc... 

this whole time i'm thinking, oh she already knows where i work, and she's probably just looking for someone whose personality matches her's. because of course no one wants an assistant who doesn't get them. duh. 

now by the time we were wrapping up, 2 hours had past, and the whole time i'm thinking oh this interview is going really well. then as we stood up to leave the cafe, she gave me one more hug, and said she ""really did enjoy our date"" and asked if i'd be interested in coming over tonight for dinner. 

i froze for a second, did she just say date?!?

panicking as if the job was still on the line i quickly said ""sure that sounds great boss"" with two thumbs up and a dumb smile on my face.

i have no idea what i'm going to do...


edit: to answer all your questions, no i didn't sleep with her, yes she's very hot, turns out she's actually 52, no i won't be taking the job, yes i went over but because i didn't want to be a dick, i ended up explaining the misunderstanding she ""apologized"" and i left, she's tried texting me a couple times through the night, i still haven't responded.

"by offering doritos to a military police officer.. this happened about 3 hours ago... be me, 29 years old male, living in probably the most corrupted country in the world (venezuela).  so just to give you some background, venezuela is in a very difficult situation, political and economical,  the majority of us want to get rid of this corrupted government and we have elections in a fee days so tension is palpable in the streets, police and military are corrupted as fuck (you can buy weapons such as grenades or sub machine guns to them,  etc etc) basically hate is in the air. so, i was in a traffic jam, one of the many we have daily when the hunger hit me, i had a big bag of doritos in my car so i decided to eat, i have a gastric bypass and can't eat that much, i was eating with my window open when a motorcycle with 2 military officers (low rank) stand beside me waiting for their turn to pass, i see the guy in the back literally drooling looking at the doritos so ""why not? i won't eat this much"" i offer him the bag and he didn't hesitate to take it with a very big smile and thanking me.... 20 seconds later the shit storm!!!! the driver next to me gets out of his car screaming ""you fu*king thieves! let the guy alone he have done nothing to you""  (he thought i was being black mailed and i got asked for money inside the bag wich is one of many ways for them to get paid black mailing you),  i get out of the car to explain that it wasn't money but hell no,  the military officer that was driving told me in not a such a pleasant way to stay inside the car that he could handle it....  he gets down the bike and goes to the guy that was screaming baton in hand when all of a sudden no less than 20 people are surrounding him screaming ""thief!!!! oppressor!!! go to hell""  and start punching him. military #2 gets downy to help his friend and getting punched and screamed he managed to get military #1 in the bike and proceed to drive as fast as he could... everyone get to their cars and guy #1 gets to me doritos in hand ""here's your money"".....  now i have back my doritos in my car and sadness in my heart for how deep this society has fallen...

"by drilling my 6 year old in the face, hail mary style.. ever throw something and know the very instant it left your hand that the throw was good..? sensational even?

&#x200b;

last week while being lazy, trying to nap like a good ""dad on duty"" should, i experienced just that. i heard a scream come from my 4 year old's room.. i slothily carried myself to the commotion to find him in a pool of tears, screaming that his older brother had thrown a toy through the window from outside and hit him in the face.

*""pretty good throw""* i thought to myself as i peeked out the window, my adrenal glands starting to kick some dust off.

""child's name"" i yell, my smug little 6 year old is jogging across our field, trying to act inconspicuous.

**""do not. throw toys. at your brother!""**

the following actions i took were inexplicable. i grabbed the small hard (hard) plastic butterfly, perhaps out of frustration, or dad-mode protection, and beamed it back out the window, in the general direction of my running 6 year old. surely without the intent of hitting him, perhaps just to show my frustration? a million year old instinct to assert my dominance? i could never make a shot like that. not in a thousand tries. he was at least 40 meters away, running perpendicular to me, his smug, older brother face looking in my direction, as if i didn't know what he had done. i would never be able to beam a moving smugface like that, too many variables.

*by god* as it rolled off the tip of my finger. i knew. it was *good*.

i knew before it left my hand, i knew mid-stroke, hell; i knew before breakfast yesterday. my son was getting drilled.

&#x200b;

before that toy left my fingers, i saw police, handcuffs, search warrants. i saw my courtroom, a stern judge and an unforgiving jury. no posted bail. no commissary. a life sentence. supervised visits in 20 years if i'm lucky. i saw my whole life pass me in an instant, i looked through the crowd for a friendly face, none to be found. not even my best friend, my wife, was there to support me. i felt that throw for a lifetime.

&#x200b;

fast forward a half a stroke and i knew. *jesus i* ***knew. it. is. good.***

&#x200b;

the smell of the turf, the cheering crowd, the stadium lights. last 10 seconds of the game, 3 points down on the 10 yard line. i spent all season playing catch on the sideline, waiting for the starter to get injured. now was my shot. a hail mary, 80 yard play is our only chance. i beam the ball with all my might and i knew. i feel the outer body euphoria when you just *know.* the ball sails to its target, the crowd knows now too, they go wild, game over! home team wins the championship!

&#x200b;

he knows as well. he knows better than i do. his life is over. in that split instant we had a conversation, he and i:

*why dad, why?*

***because. you don't. throw toys. at your brother.***

*but dad, i promise i'm sorry okay? please don't do it daddy...!*

***it's too late for that son. i already pulled the trigger. you're done and you know it.***

his bottom lip trembles as he realizes i'm right. no more second chances. game over. dad wins. he's taking that plastic butterfly to the forehead, dead center, and nothing can change it.

&#x200b;

3/4 throw and i'm in the vip room later that evening, feet kicked up, sipping top shelf champagne, surrounded by teammates, close friends and women on either side. my post game press conference is playing on the tv, along with the highlight reel. i laugh at how stupid i look in a suit. who cares. i am the mvp. i'll be damned if i spend another season on the sidelines. they shall rue the day they sidelined me. it crosses my mind that i may have made the best throw i*n history. i knew.*

a mile of airtime and wap. dead center, kill shot. chris kyle slaps me on the back. smugface wails and drops to the ground. dead.

""do not. throw toys. at your brother.""

the flag is draped over me as i make my exit, and return to my throne to nap.

&#x200b;

suddenly several security guards come in through the beaded doorway, along with two police officers. all official and serious looking.

the head of security approaches me, deep concern consumes his face. he hastily presents a cell phone to me, a hand over the receiver portion, to mask our words.

&#x200b;

""hey kid, remember that toy you threw?""

""***how could i forget... the whole world remembers!""***

""well.. your wife is on the phone, and she is not happy....""

&#x200b;

i take the phone, although fear filled the room, i walked not in fear, she would understand. she too would love the mvp.

&#x200b;

""*are you out of your friggin mind?! what did you do to zandipus?!""*

""***babe, babe, babe.. let me just say; i have an amazing story to tell you....""***

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

tl;dr - threw a dense plastic toy a ridiculous distance in the direction of my kid.. gave his face a schoolin.

&#x200b;

edit: sorry if you don't appreciate the writing style. i wanted to create something that captured that special moment, i think this post has more context than anything i've ever written or read.

&#x200b;

edit 2 / update: due to popular demand, here's the rundown of the aftermath. it smoked him straight in the forehead, he dropped, he cried, and i felt terrible. i told my wife and she was really not too upset. it was the gray area between freak accident and awful parenting. i showed her this post and she laughed all the way through. she thought it was great. of all the positive and negative feedback this received, hers was absolutely the most important to me. 

anyways to the english majors and writers out there, i think you have to grasp that it's not a build up to climax, or even a carefully formulated story-line. more so a magnification of the euphoria felt when you make a decent throw. i wrote this in 30 minutes tops, without an agenda or writing staff. i had no clue it would grab so many experienced ears. i would go back and change it had i known it would blow up. can't really do that now, as a major edit feels unethical. thank you all for the kind words and positive feedback. i'll try harder next time. 

also, i am not a writer.

"by accidentally shared nude photos of my gf and me to her very religious parents. throwaway, blablabla here goes. this is only about 2 hours ago, situation still developing. any advice is welcome.

context: so i've been dating this amazing woman for almost 4 years. went to the same uni, graduated together, lost virginities together, and we've been having an amazing relationship both in physical and emotional sense. i came from a secular family and she comes from a very religious family, though she's having doubts about religions as of late. my parents have been very good to my gf, but her parents don't like me very much because of racial and political reasons and because they know i'm not really a religious person. but still, my gf stuck with me ever since even though her parents doesn't ever stop badmouthing me (if you want to know my gf's parents' behavior, try reading up r/raisedbynarcissists and r/justnomil).

i've collected a fair amount of porn photo collection, particularly the artsy ones (metart, x-art etc) and have been wanting to photograph my gf in a similar sense. due to her having discovered her sexual sides, she agrees and actually enjoys having to pose according to my whims.

it's been about 2 years since we've been doing this and so far nothing slips by - we're very careful about the risks of our photos leaking out. that is until today.

my gf have been using this beater old phone, and she recently switched to a newer mid-range phone. she gave her old phone to her little sister who's still living with her parents. 

so we booked an amazing airbnb on our days off, and started taking photos with my gf's new phone. then i started editing the pictures in google photos, not realizing what i've been doing. then we relaxed, cooked some french fries and watched godfather 2. then my gf got a call from my parents, sounding furious, and my gf started crying. her parents demanded why does she have very explicit pictures with me, whom they disapprove since day one. her parents told my gf that gf's little sister got our nude photos, and forwarded it to them.

in a panic, we begin searching our social media posts, fearing that we shared our photos by mistake. instagram? nope, our friends didn't see anything in our posts or instastory. whatsapp/facebook? nope, we didn't post anything, nothing at all. then a bulb turned off in my head, and i looked to gf's google photo settings and gf's google account setting in the web. to my absolute horror, her old phone, which have been given to her little sister, still have access to every data that my gf have, including passwords, 2-factor authentication, emails, and worst, google photo back up and sync photos. 

what gf didn't realize is she forgot to log off her google account in her old phone. in order for her photos to be always backed-up, she turned on the synchronization in her google photos app in both phones. if you're familiar with google photos, or if you work in it, you know where this is going.

you see, every time i take a picture with the new phone, those pictures shows up in the old phone now belonging to gf's little sister. so now, her parents are furious with her and me, suspecting that i've just been using her for sexual purposes and trying to get her pregnant, and now they're coming to my gf's place (which is 4 hours apart from their home) demanding explanations. now, i love this girl to death, so i've been preparing mentally to talk with her parents about all this. i guess the only silver lining is that our photos didn't leak out to our friends/colleagues/public. wish me luck guys.

tldr: google photos sync accidentally shared my gf's explicit photo in her phone with her little sister's phone, who told her parents. now her parents is coming to town and i've been preparing to face the nuclear fallout.

"by lying about an allergy at a restaurant and ending up in the emergency room. *i've posted this on amitheasshole and everyone on that thread kept telling me to post here so be aware because i don't want you to read this again!*


i met this girl on tinder and we really hit it off. i asked her out on a date to a cozy restaurant in our small town (gainesville, fl). 

i had to take the bus there (my moped broke down last week which is another story of its own) and she lived close the restaurant so it was convenient. 

the date was going ok. it was kind of awkward at first because we just talked about the cold weather for 5 minutes -- so i decided to break the tension. a while ago, i heard about a life pro-tip where  if you order french fries at a restaurant  without salt, they have to make a fresh batch for you. i've been to this restaurant before and the guac is really good on some days and ok on other days. 

when the waitress came in, we ordered chips and guac. i then asked the waitress, ""does the guac have onions?"" to which she responded, ""yes, it does"".  i then proceeded to tell her, ""i have an extremely severe allergy to onions, can we get guac with no onions?"" i told her i have an extremely severe allergy so she doesn't just take the guac they currently have and remove the onions; this forces them to make a fresh batch from scratch. after the waitress left, my date asked me, ""are you really allergic?"" to which i said ""no :d, but this way, we get fresh guac"". she was pretty impressed like ""damn, i'm stealing this one"". when the guac came in, i asked her to give us onions on the side for my date. 

the rest of the date went well. we ordered some drinks first and then food later. what i forgot to do when i was ordering food was to tell her not to put any onions in my food. when i got my dish, i took about 2-3 bites and the waitress came running to me frantically saying that there are onions in the food!! she thought it was her fault for not mentioning it to the chefs. i didnt know how to react so i just kind of dropped the food from my mouth and into the plate. her superior walks in during this time and he's asking if everything is ok so i tell him that i forgot to mention not to put onions and that i have a severe allergy. 

the first thing the manager does is apologize profusely and then ask if he should call an ambulance.  

(side note: i don't have any allergies at all and neither does anyone in my family or any of my friends. i have no idea what a severe allergic response looks like, but i know that it like swells up your face and for some reason, i thought it makes you cough a lot, i don't know why i thought that.) 

cutscene to now: i start kind of coughing, but assure him that everything is going to be fine. i tell him, ""i barely got any onions in the bite"". my date at this time went from kind of giggling a bit (when the waitress came in) to just straight up serious after all the attention just turned to us. i told them not to worry about calling an ambulance, and that i'm okay enough to go to the emergency room myself. i asked for the check but they insisted on me not paying. (not like we ate anyway) but i still left a $20 for the waitress and assured her and the manager that it was only my fault and not the waitresses fault at all. 

after leaving, my date was half-wtf and half-laughing at the stupidity of this whole thing. i shot my shot and asked her if she'd just like to grab pizza over at her place, but she said she has to study. now it is important to note that the bus stop where i grab my bus to go home is right opposite the restaurant. i'm sitting there looking at cats fetching stuff on reddit when the supervisor pulls up in his car at the stop. he thinks that i am taking the bus to the emergency room.  

he kept insisting that he drop me to the emergency room. he felt responsible and didnt want anything to happen to me. i finally gave up and told him , ""okay"". in my head, i thought i'd just let him drop me there and then i'll take an uber back home. however, we get there and he wants to come in to make sure everything is ok.  i'm like hey man, trust me, im okay. nothing is going to happen to me. you can leave. it was so awkward. we were parked and he kept asking if i'm sure and i'm like yes i'm sure don't worry, please leave you dont have to come in with me. 

at the end he said he'd just walk me in, use the restroom and leave. we walk in the emergency room and i'm the only person there. great. i had to walk to the nurse and tell her that i might be having a slight allergic reaction. supervisor uses the restroom and asks again if everything is fine and i'm like yes, everything is going to be okay. ""thank you so much for everything."" he gives me his number and tells me to inform him once i'm out. 

here i am. a healthy 25 year old adult. having to pay $500 to visit a fucking emergency room for no fucking reason: http://imgur.com/tfu3k5g
another nurse came up to me to take my vitals and the doctor asked what was wrong and i had to sheepishly tell him, ""i think i might have been having an allergic reaction"". he says, ""are you allergic to anything?"" and i go ""no"". 

he gave me a benadryl and sent me out. i then spent another $25 to uber home. i told what happened to my friend and she said i was the worst kind of asshole. i learned my lesson and will never pretend to have an allergy again. 

tl;dr: pretended to have an allergy to get fresh guac to impress my date. got served the food i was fake allergic to, and was forced to visit the er.

"by mentally scarring my female co-worker nsfw. this happened last week but am still brooding over it 24/7 so hoping getting it off my chest may help...

so anyway, work in quite a large office building. one of those offices shared by multiple companies. we have normal male and females bathrooms but also one unisex bathroom which only has a single toilet and the unspoken rule is that it is female only. i believe in equality so disregard this rule regularly.

i always check to make sure the coast is clear and press my ear against the door before exiting to make sure i don't hear any footsteps in the corridor.

so one of my regular uses of this bathroom is to expel any unwanted gas. my office room is mostly women so being a gentlemen i never pass in that confined space. i go to the unisex bathroom, blow my trumpet and return with no one the wiser.

i sensed a disturbance from the depths so headed for the bathroom as usual. i was on the edge of erupting so had to sprint walk with every muscle clenched. in haste, i forgot to lock the door behind me.

now when i expel i also like to pull down my pants and underwear because i am always mindful of the smell clinging to the fabric of my clothes and hanging around with you for most of the day. probably paranoia but better safe than sorry. i pull down my pants and launch. was a great one. a perfect b flat minor.

i peered over my shoulder because it felt a little harder to pass than usual. sitting on the floor was a little poo nugget. not too large, maybe the size of a medium strawberry.

that's when my life changed forever. i heard the door handle jiggle before it swung open.

there i was, naked from the waist down looking over my shoulder at a piece of my own shit.

it was a small asian woman. she looked at me, then at the poo and then back at me. pale as a ghost. she quickly shut the door as i heard her heels scurry back down the corridor.

she's not with my company but i still recognized her from the break room. for a week now i haven't left my office. i don't want to see her and feel like she's told everyone and they won't stop staring at me. i like this job but part of me wants to skip town and never return. this is what you get for being chivalrous!

tl;dr a female co-worker walked in on me in the unisex toilet just as i had accidentally pooped on the floor after trying to pass gas. ",4
"by getting my work raided by the swat team.. so today about 5 minutes before my shift started, i was looking at the desk in the back and realized a small circular object that looked like an alien. it had two eyes, then a mouth that was pretty small at the bottom of it. stupid me, not knowing what the fuck it was decides to press both of the buttons to see if it did anything or what it was, and the mouth part of the object lit up red for a second. holding it in my hand, my manager walks past and i say:


 ""hey kyle, what's this thing?""


his eyes go into panic mode and says ""whatever you do, do not press that button."" 


i'm like ""well what is it?"" 


""it's the silent alarm, put it back."" 


i just think oh fuck. ""umm, i kinda pressed it like 2 minutes ago."" 


""wait are you being serious?""


""yeah, fuck.""


he goes and tells my other manager and they're like well shit, they know the cops are gonna show up any second since even if we called them they are required to come anyways. to add to this, before they come in they are supposed to call the store to check to see if it was a false alarm or if we didn't answer there was actually an emergency. well guess what, our phone system was down today so we couldn't receive calls. 


a few minutes later as i'm working, all of my coworkers and managers start looking outside like holy shit. i'm like ""what?"" turns out the whole perimeter was being surrounded by law enforcement. nothing happens for a couple more minutes until a whole fleet of cops flood the building. one of them starts talking with my managers while the others start searching the whole restaurant. everyone in the building eating was like ""what the actual fuck is going on."" after the whole situation was explained everything was resolved and they all left, but boy was it a fuck up on my part. lesson learned? don't push random buttons at work. 


to add even more to this, two of the cops who raided the place earlier came in a few hours later to get something to eat. i obviously gave them their food for free and they were really happy about that. one of them asks me ""so who was the fucker who set off the alarm?"" i was just like ""umm, that would be me officer"" and start explaining the story of how it happened. they were both laughing, said it was fine and that it happens all the time (surprisingly). they were just happy they got some free dinner, and i'm glad i could make their night a little better :)


tldr: pressed a random button at work that ended up being the silent alarm, swat team surrounded the perimeter and raided the building, came back and got some free food later. 


edit: you guys are probably right in saying it wasn't the swat team, i didn't know any better but i remember there being maybe 5 cops inside and more outside very heavily armed (way more armed than i've seen normal cops). either way it was defiantly a spectacle to watch.


edit 2: here's a picture of the alarm that i clicked - https://imgur.com/a/26qjv you can see how it kinda looks like an alien/toy. credit to /u/screamingfurby for finding that pic, i was going to just take a picture of it at work tomorrow but now you guys don't have to wait. ",4
"by having one leg.. so, i've been missing my leg for four years now. i've adapted quite well. i get around just fine with a prosthetic.

however, when i'm at home in my small apartment, i prefer to crawl short distances instead of going through the hassle of putting my prosthetic on. it's jut more convenient that way.

so last night we had some company over to watch scary movies, and i read everyone a few short submissions to /r/nosleep. everyone was pretty spooked before we went to bed. two friends of mine slept on the couch, and one of them was someone we have never had over before. so this individual had never seen me crawl without my leg on. to describe it, i kind of move like a very slow cheetah who's missing a hind leg. like a tri-pod crawl, if that makes sense. so, i suppose it can be unsettling if you're not expecting it. 

in the middle of the night/early morning, i decide to leave my room for a drink. i didn't turn the hall light on so i wouldn't disturb my sleeping guests. there's just enough light coming from the light above the sink to guide me where i needed to go. as i'm turning the corner to enter the kitchen, i see a figure and i hear ""oh shit what the fuck"", next thing i know, i'm getting kicked in the face. 
i suppose my friend recognized my foul mouth screaming back at him, because then he turned the light on and started apologizing profusely. 

tl;dr: i crawled through my apartment without my prosthetic leg, my friend thought i was a demon and started kicking me in the face.  


edit: a lot of people are asking why i don't just hop. well, in the accident that took my leg, i also maintained compound fractures in all the long bones in my remaining leg, causing the my femur, tibia, and fibula too all be replaced by titanium rods. hopping on such a leg causes too much stress and pain to my remaining knee cap. 
even without those injuries though, it's usually not recommended for any amputee to hop as a frequent mode of transport, even for short distances. ",4
"by accidentally complimenting a patients penis. this happened yesterday and im still horrified and laughing about it. im an ultrasound tech. i had a patient come in for an ultrasound because he has some swelling in one of his testicles. the normal procedure is i leave the room, he takes off his pants and underwear and lays on the exam table and covers up with a sheet. i come back in the room and place a towel over his groin while pulling down the sheet. he remains covered. i place another towel over his legs below the testicles. this keeps only the testicles exposed during the procedure. 


everything good so far. the scan involves checking each testicle as well as the surrounding area. for the most part this is just place and, get image, repeat. as im working, i can see he is slightly uncomfortable and keeps moving. it's not uncommon for men to get an erection. typically i ignore it but this guy is shifting enough that im not able to get images. i say ""don't worry about it. it's normal but i need you to hold still.""


he settles down and i continue. the towel is bulging enough that i can tell he still has the erection. i need images of the urethra so i am checking his shaft also. yep still hard. ok so this guy is hot! i have an attractive man laying on the table with no pants and an erection covered by nothing more than a bulging towel while my hand is rubbing a wand along the length of his erection. no big deal im a professional. i finish and start to put the machine away but between his moving and my nervousness i don't realize that the cord is under the edge of the towel. the towel starts to slide off as i pull so i reach down to stop it. im reaching between the bed and the ultrasound machine and lose my balance. i have a hold of the towel as i start to fall and rip it off. a blob of what i hope is lube from the ultrasound catapults up and hits me in the face as im bent over. not thinking, i use the towel that is already in my hand to wipe myself off. as im wiping my face on this guy's loin cloth i get a good view of him. after a moment i realize that im just staring at his extremely large and very erect penis. he is completely exposed but afraid to cover himself because i already got onto him for moving earlier. i start to apologize. i meant to say something along the lines of ""oh my god im so sorry"". instead what comes out is ""wow impressive"". i mentioned im professional right?


i lay the towel back over him, fumble to put the machine away and tell him to get dressed and open the door when he is done. he tries to tell me it's no big deal when he was leaving but i was so embarrassed that i couldn't even make eye contact.


edit: i'm not sure why this became so popular. there is a lot of mix between 'you made his day' and 'you should be fired'. i admit it was a mistake and i didn't intend to say something. i hope i didn't make him uncomfortable with my comment. i reported it to my supervisor though and was (am) willing to accept the consequences. i admit it was a mistake on my part. yes i'm female. no i wasn't trying to brag that women get away with abuse. yes i'm human and make mistakes. yes i apologized to the man several times for both my comment and for my clumsiness. he wasn't upset when he left the office but if he files a complaint then i will understand and i will live with it. no i did not ask him out. no i will not call him from his file. i have to get ready for work now. i will either reply to more comments or delete this post entirely later. i wasn't trying to create unwanted attention for this man or make light of the situation. i was still horrified by it when i posted so thank you to those that supported me because you helped me relax over the situation but i don't consider that permission to do it again. thank you strangers for the gold/silver/platinum.


edit2: quick update over lunch break because this has taken off so much. i expected 20 people to read it and along. my supervisor pulled me off one of my appointments earlier and called me into his office where other hospital personnel were waiting. i knew what was coming next. after i reported the incident my supervisor filed a report. this kicked off a whole process which included someone reaching out to the patient proactively for damage control. the good news is that the guy isn't upset. he had no clue why they were calling him and they said he started laughing when they explained. he was apparently apologizing to them and thought it was a waste of their time. he said and this is the best part that if he has to come back he hopes i'll be there. :) the bad part is i had to sign some forms for the hospital and was reminded that i need to be more careful. i feel i got lucky because this could have been much worse. 


tl;dr i saw a patients penis and rather than apologize i told him it was impressive.",4
"by creating a dick-shaped island and getting suspended.. when i was in 8th grade science class we had to draw and create our own land mass in order to demonstrate our understanding of wind patterns, low and high pressures, etc. i thought of the idea to make the island in the shape of a dick. our group drew it out. of course we were smart enough to make it resemble a dick but not entirely, we made sure to make it curvy on the sides, edges where the balls were, stuff like that... but it clearly was a dick. we added tornadoes near the balls to look like pubes, added futures like 'seamen lake' and 'crabs port'. we finished and wrote the amazing title, ""penn island"", or pennis land. we wrote it in big, bold, letters at the top and turned it in. a couple days later our science teacher called my group up to his desk... uh oh... but, we we were not in trouble. instead he said something along the lines of, ""i would like to put this out in the hall, this is really great work"". amazed, we all in unison agreed. for months our penn island was out in the hall, everyone saw it, everyone laughed and giggled. but the teachers never noticed until one day a parent called the school saying her daughter had told her about penn island. eventually he called our group up after class and told us about it. then out of no where, he started crying... he apologized for letting us get into trouble, he explained how its his job to keep kids from getting in trouble. he apologized to us. he said it was his fault. to this day i still feel bad for him, it was never his fault. he was a good guy. the funny part was when we played dumb with him and he had to explain to us why ""seamen port"" was inappropriate.

oh yeah, i ended up getting suspended for a day (the vice principal said i was very clever (one of my proudest moments)). only me though, since my asshole group members made a plan to blame it all on me... fuck them. 

tl;dr i drew an island in the shape of a dick for a project and it sat in the hall for months without anyone noticing, eventually a parent found out... leading to my suspension.

edit: no, i don't have a picture of it. but here is what it basically looked like. the shaded part was brown, and the rest of penn island was green. the original was on a 4ft x 4ft paper poster haha. (yes, those mini islands at the top are exactly what you think)

"by giving the cat a dutch oven. so this happened this morning and i'm going to post this on an alt account because people know my main one lmao.

this morning, like every morning, i took a shower. i woke up kinda late, and was real hungry, so i went straight from the shower to the kitchen to make myself a sandwich.

i was wearing only my towel because i'm a lazy shit and no one's home. as i'm grabbing the sandwich shit, the house cat is rubbing up against my legs. now, a note on this cat - i hate it. i hate it so much. it isn't cuddly, its real bitey, and it also fucking hates me back just as much. and now, because food is involved, it wants to be my friend. fuck you, housecat. fuck you.

i get this idea in my head that it would be hilarious to hotbox the cat with a fart. i can trap it under the towel since it's right there under me and she will literally not know what is about to be unleashed. i put my sandwich shit down and i commit to the plan, because i'm a fucking retard.

so i squat down a bit, because i want a nice seal using the beach towel as sort of shower curtain against the floor. i want this shit hermetic. fuck you, cat.

in position, i'm giggling, mostly naked in the kitchen, about to fart on a cat. i release the hounds. nothing happens. i try harder because at this point i am committed.

something happens.

the cat is now covered in a thin film of watery liquid shit. aghast at this development, cat decides to go batshit and panic. cat claws the everliving shit out of my ballsack and streaks off around the house. i had to chase it down and throw a poop-towel over it to calm it down, and then quickly take it to the bathroom to both bathe the cat (which it hates) and peroxide my torn up balls (which i hate)

e- the cat was given my sandwich as recompense  
e2- a lot of people are real mad and acting like i specifically woke up this morning with the malicious intend to shit on the cat. this was not the case. i misjudged a harmless fart. please stop threatening me with violence, lmao. i am already suffering the instant karma of a blended nutsack.  

>lizards reply corner!
alright, i'm getting a lot of ""wow this didnt habpen u lier"" stuff. so here we go. stuff goes direct to my mail thingy and im gettin real tired of answering individual people.

q: why do u own a cat if u h8 it  
a: i don't. it is my housemates cat.  
q: how did the cat stay under towel so long jet fuel cant melt steal beams  
a: have you... have you seen a cat begging? or a cat shoving themselves into a small place? cats are basically liquid. i can't pretend to know what goes on in the mind of madness.  
q: y do evry1 but me shart!!! its a lie  
a: its not like this is a common thing. when it does happen, i'm gonna post it, because its hilarious. other people also find it funny and post it, so it gets upvoted on sites like this, and you are inundated in sharting posts, i guess? so you see it all the time and think everyones lying about it, and to be fair, maybe some are. but yeah, you'll see it a lot. baader-meinhoff(https://psmag.com/social-justice/theres-a-name-for-that-the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon-59670)

"by embarrassing myself in front of the whole school. it's been awhile since i've graduated but i still haven't been able to live this down. it was the annual talent show for our high school. every student had to attend the show as an audience including me so i thought it might be a great opportunity for me to show the whole school that i am a funny rebellious kid and they should l love me. 

i spent weeks planning it, i would run up the stage and tell my very own written joke. it all seemed so great in my head. everyone would be bored out of their minds at the performance and i would save the day by making everyone laugh and cheer. then the time came. it was a normal average singing performance by one of the senior girl. crowd was quiet, so i assumed they were bored. i got up from the crowd, ran up the fucking stage like kanye west, stole the mic from the poor girl who just wanted to sing. and at the top of my fucking lungs i shouted. ""hello everyone, i am shake..spear"" while doing masturbation gesture. nobody laughed.nobody cheered. i got suspended for a 2 days and detention for a whole month. and 6 years of hell. 

tl:dr i delivered a bad pun in front of my whole school resulting in suspension and detention.  ",4
"by convincing my entire apartment building a velociraptor was on the loose. this fu happened about 6 years ago, but i still think about it to this day. 

i was a student studying at a big university that had some large, luxury apartment buildings nearby for students to live in after their freshman year. in my building, there were around 400 apartments across 8 floors. i lived in one of these apartments with three roommates. modern gym, stainless steel appliances-- nice place. 

the fu starts with me not wanting to drink my face off for once on a saturday and wake up the next morning feeling like a train wreck, and instead wanting to have a ""wholesome"" night of fun. so instead of going out, i decided to post signs around the building that a dinosaur, specifically a velociraptor, was on the loose. harmless, right?

i spent some time putting this flyer(https://imgur.com/igbtdiw) together, purposely making it ridiculous by adding phrases like ""look out for the velociraptor mating call"" and ""ask security for repellent""-- i figured people would laugh about it. then i walked down to the apartment building's lobby to use their free printing and make about a hundred copies. finally, starting at about 9 pm, i spent the next two hours posting the sign on various doors around the building. 

for better or worse, it was a saturday, and people were getting drunk. about halfway through my adventure, as i was getting into the elevator to change floors, i saw a girl dressed to go out, makeup done, on the phone with someone, tears streaking her mascara as she struggled to convey to someone that there ""had been a velola-raptor attack and that she didn't know what to do."" me at the time thought this was really funny and kept going, and ultimately, after posting my hundred flyers, i went back to my apartment, watched some tv, and went to bed. that sunday i spent most of my time doing homework and not leaving my room.

on monday while in class my roommates' group text lit up with ""does anyone know what this(https://imgur.com/snosyew) is? it was a pile of 4 ""notices of lease violation"" suggesting someone had caused a ""disturbance on the property"" and that there would be a fine. me being fairly young, i got spooked, bounced from class, and biked to my apartment to take care of it.

i grabbed the notices and went to the leasing office. i'll shorten it immensely,  but the conversation can be summarized as such:

me: ""hi, i got these notices at my apartment today about causing a disturbance. i was wondering what it's about?""

apartment agent: ""oh, so it's you."" calls out to someone outside his office: ""get in here ""other apartment agent,"" it's the dinosaur boy!""

oaa, a guy trying too hard to be serious: ""do you know what you did last night?""

me: ""yeah, i just posted some funny and clearly harmless signs around that there was a dinosaur on the loose. also it was just me, so don't include my roommates here.""

oaa: ""okay, just you, but it was neither funny nor harmless. do you know how many calls security got? i had parents calling in demanding to know about the situation. we had students asking if there was a bunker to hide in.""

me, a little bewildered: ""uh, the sign said velociraptor. dinosaur. clearly extinct. it was just a joke. how did people take that seriously?""

oaa: ""look, *i know* velociraptors have been dead for over 10,000 years, but you caused a disturbance, and i still have to fine you.

*10,000 years*. fuck. there would be no winning with this guy. i asked him what the fine was ($100), ran back up to write a check, and paid it. (note: they apparently knew it was someone in my apartment who posted the signs by following security footage).

to this day i wonder how many fully functioning adults at prestigious universities think velociraptors are real, that they aren't dinosaurs but are instead a vicious reptile that people illicitly keep as pets or that you can go see at the zoo. i also occasionally wonder about the panic i caused, thinking about the girl who was likely on the phone with her parents, and all her parents probably heard were ""someone died -- on the loose -- don't know what to do."" 

i still laugh about it.

tl;dr: posted signs around my building saying that a velociraptor killed someone and was on the run. freaked out my drunk building and management got involved. got fined $100.",4
"when my husband walked in on me naked with 7 emergency service men. i'm 6 months pregnant, barely showing and randomly woke up one day last week unable to move. at first, i'm terrified that i'm paralysed. then i realise it's really severe sciatic pain and i genuinely cannot walk/get up or really breathe too deeply.

i have no signal in my room but i do have wifi, so i call my husband who calls emergency services for me. within 20 minutes, 2 firefighters turn up knocking on the door. my husband is a good hour or more away still and they have to break into a window in the bedroom (big french windows). they try to move me, realise they can't and call another two firefighters from the truck outside. even with four of them trying to gently move me up and off the bed, it's not possible. i am in just too much pain and screaming every time they try. they also have no medication. 

my cleaner turns up. idiot me forgot she was due and i could've saved the window, oh well. fu number one. 

in my area, there is a shortage of ambulances so firefighters get called first. they decide we need to wait for the doctor. the doctor takes around an hour to arrive and brings 2 colleagues. they can't numb me, because i'm pregnant and it is only achievable to move me by extremely slowly moving me bit by bit.

of course, at this moment my husband arrives, with an extremely puzzled expression, walking through the smashed french doors. i am at first confused, why does he look so befuddled by this situation, starring his ailing wife? 

oh, yes, probably because i am absolutely buck naked as i cannot move to get dressed, legs akimbo as they are being slowly moved one by one into a better position, surrounded by 7 not unattractive tall german men, 2 of whom are *actively holding my legs open to help me*. it slowly dawns on me i am basically in a porno. and this suddenly becomes really fucking funny to me, so i laugh. and as i laugh, the pain goes all the way from my left big toe to my right middle finger like an electric shock and i pass out. fu number 2. my final image of this scene was my poor cleaner giving me a sympathetic look from the inner doorway and trying not to cross herself looking at my naked state of being. deeply catholic woman. i would rather my entire family see me like this than her. 

turns out later, when i come to, i've really caused my back quite some problems by passing out in this delicate position and i'll be bed-ridden for a few weeks. without decent pain medication because of my developing crotch goblin. i bet the emergency service workers are going to get some mileage out of this one.

tl;dr thought i was paralysed, emergency services had to move me naked, husband walks in and observed 7 men tending to his naked wife, i laugh and do more damage than was there in the first place. 

edit: some people asking why i didn't get covered with a blanket. i'd guess in the half sitting half lying position i was in, a blanket would have slipped off and been really inconvenient for the doctor having to delicately move me. i didn't even notice my nakedness until husband showed up, the pain was way worse than the embarrassment.

"meta so many ""tifu"" are becoming humblebrags now. the nsfw tag is becoming equivalent to clickbait.. most front page i see involve sex. /r/circlejerk makes allusions to this with ""by putting my penis into my girlfriend's vagina""

more and more i see which just seem to be people either wanting to say they've had sex, or making blatantly fake stories with plot holes. i get the weekend rule, which is fantastic, but what happened to this subreddit? before i had this account, it was my first subreddit to browse. now it just seems to be kids acting like my example below.

but since this is tifu, i must provide a tifu:

by being so *fucking* better than you. i also had sex. with a girl. in her vagina. the upper one. she came. then her sister heard us having sex and insisted she join because im so good. then my already 12 inch penis grew 4 more inches, before i became president of the world.

"by having a conversation with my mom about sex. the fu was yesterday. i made a post on whisper about how i thought it was weird when guys left only their socks on during sex. my location was on when i posted, so people in my home town could see it under local. 

i get a message from the post from another chick, we start talking about it and describing our experiences with dudes getting naked for sex but leaving their socks on, including a funny little sex story about her and her ex husband. 

i come from my bedroom to the living room, where my mom currently is, as i send a message to the chick. that's when i heard the distinct whisper notification sound from her phone like 4 seconds after

at first i thought ""well that's a coincidence"", but in case it wasn't, i asked casually ""ooh who's texting you, cute guy?"" following ""no some lady i are talking about sex"" (my mom is very blunt about these things, but she probably said that to make me leave her alone anyway). 

that's when it hit me for real. oof, just had a conversation about my parents having sex. yea, my dad leaves his socks on... thinking about deleting whisper now.

tldr: accidentally had a convo with my mom about her and my dads' sex life on whisper

edit: well i don't find socks-on-only during sex all that weird anymore, i guess it just looked weird on the one guy. was probably the socks he was wearing actually

"by stabbing my husband while we were both horny. hey all,

happened 2 fridays ago not today but you know, formatting rules.

so my (f27) husband (m29) is a stay-at-home dad while i am a working wife. every morning, before i leave for work, my husband polishes my shoes.

since he has a submissive fetish, and i get some kinky pleasure out of this as well, what usually happens is that i would stand two steps up from the ground floor while my husband would kiss my feet and suck my toes. he would put my socks and shoes on, and then polish my shoes while i am wearing them, then, he would prostrate at the bottom of the steps while i would literally (albeit lightly) step on his head out the door.

&#x200b;

that, i had an event to get after work so i decided to spice things up and wear some high heels to work. in fact, i got them kind of sharpened as i was trying to imitate esme squalor (couldn't literally use knifes as heels as that wouldn't be practical).

so anyway, my husband kissed my feet, sucked my toes, put on my heels and started polishing them. he prostrated as usual, and not wanting to place my heels on his head, i thought i would aim for his shoulder blade. unfortunately i missed and ending up stabbing the back of his neck

he started bleeding so i called 911 and he was taken to the er. i told the doctors that we were having a fight in which i stabbed him with my heel.

so they called the police and i was arrested for domestic abuse until my husband was discharged from the hospital and able to convince the officers what really happened. he was extremely embarrassed to do so, and the police kept telling him that men can be abused as well, etc... neither my husband or i have ever been this publicly embarrassed. i'm just glad that i wasn't literally using knives for heals

&#x200b;

**tl;dr. accidently stabbed my husband during our morning sexual ritual. he got hospitalized and i got arrested**

**edit 1: we are not a bdsm couple. yes he shines by shoes and prostrates to me. but i do not go around torturing him. it's not a bdsm type of submission fetish. more of a ""i wear the pants"" kind of submission**

**edit 2: i had stiletto heals. i wanted to be like esme and use a stiletto knife as a heal but that would also be impractical. so i decided to sharpen my heals instead. just like how one would sharpen anything else. by squaring out the corners and making them pointer. and moving the bottom square in so the part touching the floor is sharp edges. got a cobbler (yes they do still exist) to do it**

**edit 3: i do not have pictures of the heels. the police seized them and won't give it back**

**edit 4: if i made this up for karma, then why would i use a throwaway?**

**edit 5: since everyone is asking about the kids; they are sleeping. my husband and i wake up at 5, and am out the door by 6**",4
"by moving in next door to a drug dealer. i posted this in r/casualuk yesterday and it went down pretty well, and a couple of posters convinced me to post it here. apologies if this is overkill and you've already read it! and honestly, i don't know if it qualifies as a tifu, so i am sure the mods will decide. be gentle, mods...  anyway, a very english break-in story is pasted below... 
  
i may have over-egged the detail, so this story is quite long. the detail is pretty accurate, cos i made notes immediately after the event, and i've tried really hard to be honest and not embellish too much!
  
on the first day of moving into my new house back in april of 2015, my neighbour came to introduce himself - and it wasn't long before i deduced that he was in the drug-dealing business. i initially thought that wasn't so bad, i like a smoke from time to time and having him next door could be useful. even if i went back in time right now to warn myself, there's no way i could convey how wrong i was... 
  
now 2015 was otherwise known as the worst year of my life. it certainly wasn't what back to the future had let me to expect. 
  
after losing my dad to cancer, my sister having a miscarriage and my bbq exploding on my birthday gathering, i was beginning to think my luck would have to turn soon. it was august, the summer was ending and nothing bad had happened for two whole months…
  
i'd been up late watching it follows, and not being much of a horror fan, i was suitably creeped out. and slightly high. my girlfriend had come home late from a work function and had gone straight to bed, and at about 12.30am i went up there too.
  
it's probably worth explaining that this house has three floors. the ground floor has an entrance, spare room and stairs, the first floor is the kitchen and living room, and the top floor is the bedroom and bathroom. it's one of three houses in a little mews in a leafy sussex village.
  
i went to bed and was soon drifting off. about 15 minutes later i heard some banging. i didn't pay it much mind, assuming that watching a horror movie before bed had made me oversensitive. so i started to go back to sleep. the next memory i have is of shouting. lots of shouting. the bedroom door burst open, and a group of large figures stormed in, brandishing crowbars.
  
i remember screaming in that way you try to in a dream, when nothing comes out. i also recall spinning around slightly so as to block my girlfriend, an incredibly sweet and innocent creature who had barely witnessed a crime in her life. i thrust out my legs, kicking one of them in the crown jewels firmly. this led the ring leader to crack me on the legs with a crowbar, telling me in no uncertain terms to not do that again.
  
so now there are at least four men lined up alongside my side of the bed. maybe five. hard to tell, i didn't get to put my glasses on. my girlfriend is screaming, they're all shouting, and i'm incredibly confused. the ringleader then demands that i give him the bag of money.
  
""what money!?"" i asked.
  
""give us the fucking bag of money, we know you've got the bag of money!"" the ringleader repeats. several times.
  
""i don't have a bag of money,"" i explained. it's hard to remember the order of events, but i do know one thing for sure - tom cruise popped into my head.
  
the previous night i was watching mission: impossible 3. i do like that film, and i had it on in the background while i did the washing up. i remember pondering the scene where ethan hunt's wife has a gun to her head. ""i want to give you what you want, but you've got to do what's right!"" exclaimed hunt. hmmm. i wonder if the screenwriter had researched this dialogue. is this what you are supposed to say in a hostage crisis?
  
well, it apparently sewed a seed, because i found myself repeating those words.
  
""i don't have a bag of money. i want to get you what you want, but you have to do what's right and leave this poor girl alone,"" are the words that came, strangely confidently, out of my mouth.
  
""yeah? well we know you sold drugs to my daughter!"" said the one i considered to be the sidekick.
  
""nah nah nah, it was my sister,"" said the ringleader in correction.
  
this exchange told me two things - one, they did not have a particularly good grasp of what their plan was, and two, they were after my neighbour.
  
for my neighbour is a drug-dealing maniac. a weird guy from essex. he's in his mid-30s, about 5'8"" with light blonde hair and eyebrows to match. he's skinny and zany, usually hopping from one foot to the other as he tries to keep his excessive energy in check. he smokes weed from 7am, and boxes on his outdoor punchbag whenever the weed isn't enough to keep his energy in check.
  
sometimes he can be seen in the communal car park making things. like the time he made a wooden triangle(https://i.imgur.com/2e6fguw.jpg). or he juggles balls with his dogs, or he shadow boxes. you know, the usual things you expect to see your neighbour doing at literally any hour of the day or night. 
  
still, realising that the intruders were in the wrong house, i wasn't entirely keen on sending them next door. as much as i disliked my neighbour, i didn't think he deserved a group of masked men storming in. so i continued to try and talk these people out of the house.
  
""i'm not a drug dealer, so i've no idea what you're talking about. there's a couple of macbooks downstairs, sixty quid in my wallet, an imac… whatever you want, just take it and go mate.""
  
hearing this offer, the ringleader realised i was being compliant. and if i was willing to give up a few grands worth of computers, why wouldn't i just give him the bag of money he was seeking? slowly, the cogs turned.
  
""is this number 27?"" he demanded to know.
  
""the whole area is.""
  
""yeah but is this number two, twenty seven acacia avenue?""
  
""no, it's number one.""
  
""we've got the wrong house!""
  
the realisation was startling. they all shouted. one guy had been searching every room, cupboard and drawer. he had given up already. one or two of the others went down stairs to get him, leaving me and my gf with the ringleader and his sidekick, a guy i suspected was far darker in soul than the guy doing all the talking.
  
""right, you can't call the cops or we'll come back. we know where you live!"" the sidekick said.
  
emboldened by the realisation that these guys were morons, i laughed. ""you seriously think i won't call the cops? best i can do is give you a thirty second head start.""
  
he didn't like that, so he took my phone. good, i thought. i'll track that fucker. sadly, i later discovered, he threw it behind my sofa on his way out of the house.
  
the ringleader then apologised. he said they were looking for someone else, and there had been a mix up. i said something along the lines of ""well i am glad we sorted that out."" at which point he shook my hand, told me he hoped my gf would be ok, and forced the sidekick to leave with him.
  
i picked up the bed and jammed it against the door, and enveloped my traumatised girlfriend in a big hug and told her it was over. which it almost was.
  
little did we know, the morons had decided to try again, this time knocking my neighbour's door in and storming his house. but he was in the kitchen, so they went flying past him, up to the bedroom where they found his girlfriend. my neighbour, being the kind of guy he is, then jumped out of the window, abandoned his gf, ran to my front door and stormed into my home.
  
""the-go-kid! the-go-kid! there are people in my house!"" he screamed.
  
""no shit,"" i responded. ""why do you think my fucking door is wide open?""
    
i went out to meet him while talking to the police on my gf's phone. he grabbed a knife from my kitchen, the phone from my hand, and went after them. i decided i was done, went back to enjoy the barricade of the bedroom.
  
it took the police a while to turn up, because the genius neighbour of mine told them they had guns, so we had to wait for armed response. eventually, my gf and i cautiously walked down to the living room. the police eventually arrived, but they knew it was too late. so they stood outside our houses having a chat and a bit of a laugh. it's likely to be the only time i tell four men with machine guns to shut the fuck up.
  
the rest of the night was a mess of police as they took statements, searched for evidence and quizzed my neighbour about, yes, the bag of money. they were convinced they could bust him for something, as they had wanted to for some time. turns out he had broken his foot when he leapt from the window, and so he was carted off in an ambulance. as the stretcher went past me in the car park, he tried to talk to me.
  
""go kid! i just want to say one thing mate! i just want to say one thing!"" he screamed.
  
""neighbour, you're not physically capable of saying just one thing.""
  
the police, who knew him all too well, erupted in laughter. this humiliation would haunt him for some time.
  
eventually i heard that my neighbour had claimed it was all because of an instagram picture he had posted on facebook, and he thought he knew the ringleader. a scumbag he'd recently connected with on fb. he gave the police two weeks to charge the guy. to the credit of the police, they arrested him but didn't have the evidence to charge him.
  
about a month later, my neighbour beckoned me into his garage where he remonstrated with me for blaming him for the ordeal. ""they terrorised us too!"" he said. he then told me he had taken matters into his own hands, dealing with the ringleader himself, putting him in some sort of box and, i presume, torturing him. he tried to show me some sort of video evidence but i refused to look at it. ""we have to look after our women!"" he said.
  
he then said that he was aware i had reacted like a pussy when the guys got into my room. a bit bemused by this, i asked him if it was more gutless to scream or to jump out a window and leave my partner behind. this enraged him, and we haven't spoken a single word to each other since.
  
the only stuff that was stolen was money from our wallets and my leatherman (it had 'that's not a knife' engraved in it). nobody was ever charged with the break-in and eventually life went back to normal, albeit with a very expensive new front door. i moved house this year, so i can only hope i never see my neighbour's face again.
  
 i know some people find this story entirely unbelievable, but it would appear i've got back-up on that front(https://ol.reddit.com/r/casualuk/comments/9ey4pe/i_endured_the_most_english_home_invasion_ever/e5tap79/) as one of the responding officers is on reddit and confirmed the story's validity on my original post! 
  
tl:dr - masked men broke in, stormed my bedroom, realised they got the wrong house, said sorry and broke into next door instead. also, my neighbour is a knob.
  
edit: i've been encouraged to post this bit of info as well - 
  
the police called it a 'scum on scum' attack, and when those inadvertently mess with innocent bystanders, the scumbags are usually apologetic. they even said ""don't be surprised if you get an anonymous bunch of flowers"". we didn't, but judging by some of the messages i have received, it really is something that happens.

on this day, i had to get giant industrial plastic bags (imagine thickness of painters plastic) for our collection center. these bags are huge, and come in rolls of around 50. probably one lb per bag.
so these rolls are stored in an storage area at the top of the hangar bay, about 30-40 feet off the deck.
i made sure the area was clear of people, and dropped it down from there like i had a million times before.
this is where things fucked up. it went rogue. went sideways, broke a sprinkler activation switch off the wall.
when i came down, the sprinkler system went off. this isn't normal sea water though. this is a hangar bay to handle jets and fuel. we had to have something to smother liquid fires, which is afff (aqueous film forming foam). this stuff is great for smothering liquid fires, but is highly corrosive and is stupid expensive. around 1.5k per gallon. usually it mixes with salt water before leaving the sprinklers, but today the sea water was shut off to this part of the ship. as such, it dumped pure afff. around 600 gallons. it also landed on some expensive pieces of equipment, and downed them for repair.
all in all, i cost the navy approximately 1.5 million in wasted afff and repairs to equipment.

tl;dr broke a sprinkler activator off the wall being dumb, dumping expensive firefighting liquid that is corrosive onto expensive equipment.

edit: have had a lot of people asking about punishment. somehow i got a slap on the wrist. i went to my division officer and told her everything that transpired, somehow she got me off the hook. honestly the most surprising thing that happened in my five years of navy.

edit 2: holy cow, thanks for my first silver.

edit 3: confession: in the interest of full disclosure, the only reason i fessed up was because i had heard my cmc (command master chief) was out for blood. wanted whoever did it in drb that day, and had security video footage. after i fessed up, i found out that the god damn security camera didnt see shit. it cutoff three feet to the right of my crime.",4
"by having my mom clean up my gallons of dried cum under the side of my bed.. ok so this actually happened 8 years ago. i was 16 and was just getting into the habit of watching porn on my phone in bed on the iphone 3gs at the time. now keep in mind that my parents are very religious and conservative, and i grew up in what you'd say a privileged household as well.  

almost every night right before going to bed, i'd watch porn for about half an hour whilst slowly stroking my dick. just as i'm about to cum, i'd tilt my body sideways, dick aimed at the wall on my right, and shoot straight down there. i was in the mentality where ""if it's under the rug no one will find out"" similar to when you drop chips on the floor. 

anyways, i kept doing this for about a year, and i never really bothered to look under the bed.  

one day, my room was messy and my mom was pissy. she walks in, yells at me for having a very untidy room then she says that's it, we're deep cleaning the room right now. she makes me go fetch cleaning stuff to help out. i remember being very pissed off because she interrupted what would be my afternoon fap session.   

so carpets removed, furniture moved around, and deep cleaning commences.  

when the bed was moved to the side, i almost shat my pants when i saw the horrific view of what was under.  

sticky, yellowish, dried cum which was tainted down the wall, and into a massive puddle that had about a 10mm thickness, and you can actually see ants, and small roaches whom have been caught up and died right in that puddle. 

now my mom casually asks ""what's this?""  

in panic, i told her that i was having ice cream in bed one day and that i spilled it to the side, and forgot to tell her about it.  

she got x100 angrier at this point, telling me how careless and dirty i am. nevertheless, she seemed to have bought it.  

several minutes later, she started scrubbing the puddle of cum while i was looking in shame. i felt like the biggest sack of shit on earth. feelings of disgust, shame, and guilt overwhelmed me. i vowed to not masturbate to the side wall anymore. 

anyhow, the nightmare didn't end there. after a few minutes of scrubbing, the now wet puddle of cum starts to emit odour. shortly after, the entire room smelled of cum. it was the most disgusting smell you could imagine. i was horrified and didn't know what my mom was thinking at the time. i was just playing dumb and was pretending to move around shit in the room to make it seem i was helping her, when secretly i was shitting my pants. 

at the end of it, she just said to me ""remember, god is always watching. he's very unhappy with you."" and left.  

religious me back then cried in the same night, and i was begging for god's forgiveness for weeks in end. 

not too long after however, i realised that i learnt my lesson, and that's when i started using tissues in bed.  

tldr; masturbated to the side of the bed for a year, mom wants to do a deep clean of the room, find cum puddle, tell her it's ice cream, she scrubs the whole thing making the entire room smell of cum. 

edit: fuck did this blow up. you guys made me aware of the coconut story and the cockroaches story, i found comfort in knowing there are more fucked up redditors out here. yes it is horrible what i did and disgusting, but i promise i'm a regular functioning adult in society now.",4
"by riding horses, having long hair and labia.. i am spooked and mortified right now. 

so i'm a female with rather long hair who rides horses - i have 3, compete regularly etc. 

anyway, yesterday i was happily riding my first of two horses for the day, when about half way through i thought i had a *front* wedgie. no big deal, pull/shuffle it out and move on, yeah? a little while later i felt it again and pulled it out again. 

i finished my ride, tacked up the second horse, then rode him. again i kept feeling this discomfort wedgie, they weren't even the right pants to give me a wedgie! 

anyway i shook it off as no biggie, finished the horses for the night, went home, showered, then went out to see some friends. 

this morning, i awoke at around 6.30am with intense labial pain. yep. so i grab a mirror and have a look and oh jeez it's a horror. there is a dark red lump. a big one. perhaps fingernail sized. at first i thought my clit was inflamed. nope, not that... std? googled them all. nope. a moment later i realise *there is a hair hanging off it*. yep. i think i have given myself a labial hair tourniquet.

with my hair length i often end up with hair on my clothing *edit: my hair is always tied back when i ride, the hair must have slithered into my pants beforehand* so i'm thinking the friction from riding caused the hair to get looped around. apparently showering means the hair gets looser and when it dries it tightens... so uh. i'm on my way to a &amp; e as i can't remove it myself. there is definitely a hair dangling down. maybe around 4 inches. i didn't notice anything last night. 

my hair is between waist and butt length.

i can't wait to have some doctors look at my poorly labia ): 

**edit**: just confirming its hair from my head that is looped around. 

**update 1**
doctor number one has looked at my foofie and referred me to a gynaecologist on a ward. she agrees it's a hair tourniquet... they need specialist equipment and numbing things. it's rather swollen. f my luck. 

**update 2**
the nurses at gynaecology managed to untie and cut the hair after some fiddling about. they'd never had a case like it before... so it's pretty rare my fellow gals. still be careful and vaginalant. they said i definitely did the best thing going to them rather than trying to do it myself, i'm blonde as well so it was almost invisible! plus the swelling made it difficult to see. 

also i must've caught it quick, none of the tissue has died or anything but i need to keep an eye on it. feeling a bit bruised. 

**update 3**
thank you for gold omg, at least i got something good out of this hahaha, trying to respond to comments but sorry if i lose track <3 

**update 4**
clarifying location for some confused redditors! it was to the right then lower of the urethra and the ball was almost spherical and the size of a fingernail. it was a human head hair, and though it first became caught while riding the real fu was when i showered and didn't notice the hair that must have been caught, then it became further tangled through the night and evening. i finished riding at around 7.30pm. 

**update 5** 
we have made the front page... brilliant... 😂

**update 6** 
(removed - there are pictures similar to my case but there are concerns about the medical file due to the potential age of the case study)

**update 7** 
i've gotta get on with my life for a few hours, but i'll make a point of responding to comments directed at me this evening. lots of love fellows. 

**tl;dr**: horse riding friction caused (what i think is) labial hair tourniquet and now doctors can look at my labia!!

"by orgasming so hard i broke my vagina.. by orgasming so hard i broke my vagina

happened a couple of days ago, as is tradition. throwaway because some irl folks know my normal handle on here.


so a couple of months ago my doctor put me on a new ssri to help with my chronic depression. it didn't work that well and made me super-dazed, and on top of that my sex drive dried up to a level that can only be described as ""sahara-like."" now, it's not like i'm in a relationship or anything, but i still enjoyed getting off at least a couple times a week, and found myself very wound up without my normal release.


i told my doctor that the medication just kind of put me in a fog, so she switched me to an snri and holy horniness my sex drive came back with a vengeance. after work one day, i came home and decided to treat myself to a round or two with my vibrator, to celebrate. well, it had been building up so long in me that i went to town and had one of the most intense orgasms of my life. i should note at this point that i didn't use lube, because i was so..worked up..i figured i didn't need it.


sounds great, right? eh..not so much, because right after finishing the deed, i realized i had a shooting pain in my vagina, like i had badly pulled a muscle. after spending a couple of minutes laying in state, praying to every god and deity out there to make the pain subside, i made the long, labored waddle to the toilet, only to realize i was dripping a lot of blood, too. 


before you ask, no, it was not shark week for me, so needless to say, i was surprised. upon further inspection, i realized that i not only pulled a muscle deep in my lady parts that had me walking funny for a day, i suffered a vaginal tear due to my..vigor..as well. however, it was a lot more blood than any little tears i had had in the past, and prior to this, i never tore from masturbating, so i was convinced i really badly injured myself, and may need stitches.


i called my ob's office and made an appointment, and i explained what happened, all while turning shade of purple that barney the dinosaur would envy. my doctor took a look and welp, i was right, i needed stitches, and instructed me that in the future during any particularly-intense sessions, i should probably use lube, just to be safe. ironically, now i now have to once again abstain from all sexual activity for a period of time, so i'm back to square one. 


needless to say, the whole experience was not what i was expecting, and has been something i would prefer to not experience, ever again.


tl;dr got super horny, overdid it during a solo session, and broke my vagina.

edit: thanks for all the lube tips, guys. just ordered (look up the drum of lube on amazon, was apparently inadvertently linking to my wishlist, too) so i think i'm good to go for future sexytimes! (not really, but i did order a few different brands suggested and really appreciate it!) 

edit 2: been getting a lot of questions about my antidepressants. i was on celexa and am not on cymbalta. feel free to pm me if you have any further questions, happy to have helped some folks out 😀. sorry if it takes me a while to respond, been getting a ton of questions and i want to make sure i answer them all, thoroughly!

edit 3: gold! holy crap, thank you, internet stranger! who knew my most read post would ever be about injuring my vajayjay...i'll take this opportunity to throw out a lube, lube, and lube some more! also, know if you pull a muscle while orgasming, the pain is intense but it should only last a day or so.",4
"by hilariously ruining sex with my girlfriend. for background: i'm (30s/m) in a 7+ year relationship with my gf (30s/f). we've been having a bit of a dry spell lately, so the gf decided to spice things up by buying a remote controlled vibrator. when i came home from work yesterday, she surprised me at the door by handing me the remote control and telling me she had it inserted, and to play around with it however i wanted. we then had a lovely dinner of different fancy cheeses and meats with bread. while we ate i would occasionally reach under the table and push the button to change settings. by the end of dinner we were both quite aroused, and she hopped on my lap and started grinding against me, ready to move things to the bedroom...

aaaaand this is where things began to go wrong. i work a high pressure job with long hours and hadn't had time to eat anything at work all day that day. i had eaten voraciously during dinner, and probably ate a good half a pound of various cheeses. i started to feel a little nauseous while she was grinding up on me, and said i might need a moment to digest. she wasn't having any of it, and insisted we head to the bedroom. so i figured fuck it, we'll just do it live.

in the bedroom she lays down and asks me to hop on top. meanwhile, the vibrating insertable is going full tilt. the noise it was making was an alternating ""waaahhh-eeeeee"" pause. ""waaahhh-eeeeee"" pause. ""waaahhh-eeeeee"" pause.. but this thing is like 90% buried inside her, so the sound is coming out a little muffled and distorted. and i swear all i could think of at that moment was how it sounded exactly, spot on, like the robot from the movie wall-e screaming for help, terrified, buried alive. i burst out laughing as she looks at me in bewilderment. this kills the mood and causes the nausea i was feeling moments before to hit a crescendo. after i explain both what i was laughing about and why i suddenly looked so sick, she starts laughing, which makes it even harder for me to stop laughing, nausea getting worse every second.

finally we both calm down. she steps out to give me a moment to get over the sick stomach feeling and for her to remove the toy. a few minutes pass, then she comes back in. im on my back still feeling profoundly queasy, but tell her i'm ready to go! she hops on top, starts making out with me, then starts going at it in cowgirl. as the thrusting gets more and more intense, she was getting really close to orgasm as i was getting closer and closer to throwing up. finally as she was jjjjust about ready, she brought her face close to mine during one particularly violent thrust, causing one of the foulest burps i've ever had to escape. i taste cheese mixed with shame as she throws herself off of me, yelling, gagging, and laughing hysterically at me. i feel terrible but can't help but laugh, which only makes the nausea worse. at that moment i was about as close to throwing up as you can get without actually doing it. she leaves the room still laughing but utterly disappointed. i just lay there aroused, sick to my stomach, and frustrated at myself for eating like a goldfish during dinner.

there were no further attempts at sex that night.

tl;dr  wall-e combined with too much cheese ruined sexy times",4
"by having to sign my mortage in cat heads over 30 times.. in 2015 i had to renew my license and thought it would be funny to do cat heads as my signature, so i did. for the past 3 years i just forgot about it unless i had to show my id and they pointed it out. they would laugh and say, ""haha i can't believe they let you do that!"" and i would be like, ""yeah, yeah, yeah, let me in the bar now."" i have always signed my name with my regular signature/scribble, not cat heads. this hasn't been a problem until today when i had to sign my mortgage papers. the signing agent looked at my id and shook his head, he was not amused. i tried to explain that 2015 brad never imagined he'd own a house. so the dude has to call the title company headquarters and explain the situation all while my real estate agent is laughing her ass off. i had to sign 3 cat heads over 30 times today.

"by knocking out my date. so yesterday was valentine's day and i've been seeing a girl who used to wrestle when she was younger. i was a wrestler for 10 years and we both knew this. so we get drunk last night and start messing around on the couch. we're just using moves on each other and i'm winning. 

we do this for a while and it's all fun and games until she says ""i bet i can beat you from the standing position."" we are both pretty trashed at this point so we stand up in her living room and start facing off. we tie up with each other and instinct kicks in so i sprawl and slam her head into the hardwood floor. i spin around behind her and then i realize she isn't moving.

at this point i realize that i fucked up badly. she comes to and she has a huge black and blue knot over her eye brow. i'm feeling like a gigantic piece of shit and after a couple of seconds she laughs and says it's okay. 

so the tl;dr here is that i got trashed on wine with a girl. we wrestled. i knocked her tf out on a hardwood floor. now she has a lump like a pachycephalosaurus on her head.

"by getting the bomb squad called to my local park and getting a statewide manhunt put into place.. before you read. i. know. it. was. dumb. thats. why. im. here. enjoy the godamn story ""karen"" is in the comments if you want both sides of the story.

nvmd they left

so. this all started yesterday, i had left work early because i felt like shit and didnt want to work with a cold. i didnt know what to do with all this free time i've just been granted so i figured,""hey let's make a rocket."" i've seen the king of randoms video on how to make a rocket engine out of pvc pipe and household ingredients so i thought i'd give it a go. i picked up all the stuff i needed and made my way to the park(wide, open, and well ventilated area).

 first mistake, i was supposed to use 3/4 pvc. i used an inch and a half. second mistake, karen was sitting in the corner of the park hidden from view.(you'll see how she plays into this)

 so my buddy and i spend about an hour or so constructing this failed abortion of a rocket, adding much more fuel than necessary and packing too tight. the time comes where this bad boys ready to fly and we start taking precautions; we alerted everyone in the area, and even gathered a small crowd to watch the rocket.

 however, we completely missed karen as she was fucking hiding in her car on the far end. so we light the godamn thing and instead of launching it just smokes. like a lot. like so fucking much it looked like there was a forest fire, i cant put into words how much smoke this foot long ""rocket"" was producing. we soon realized it's a dud and we leave it be so it will run out of fuel. just our luck a group of track kids come out of the woods to run laps( on the track the rocket is chilling on) and they just stop and stare, clearly concerned. we realized our mistake and attempted to put it out except it just wouldn't. fucking. stop. eventually a kid from our crowd yeeted it into a nearby field and it eventually died down. we attempted to clean up the mess but nothing was cooperating. the rocket had eaten a hole into the pavement and there was molten plastic everywhere. we picked up what we could and left hoping that would be the end of it.(it was apprently fucking not) 
so my buddy and i are sitting in mcdonalds talking over the situation when a large black police unit drove by. not too suspicion but they're not common to our area, and this had plating all around it. we joked about it being a bomb squad and eventually forgot about it. fast forward to the next morning i get a call from my brother claiming someone planted a pipebomb at our park. they had pictures of our cars and had a statewide search in place. apparently karen had to get her titties in a bunch and made a post on facebook about the ordeal, claiming ""two men were seen planting a incendiary device at the local park"" 

asap, i hauled ass down to the local police station to clear things up. fhey called up the bomb squad to check to see if it looked more like a bomb or a rocket and we took the time to go over my abominations. they were very understanding, and eventually got everything cooled down. all that came from it was a ticket for disturbance of the peace and a warning to not make godamn rockets in public parks. i'm terrible at retelling things so let me know if my storytelling needs work .

tl;dr i made a really shitty rocket and karen called a bomb squad.

edit: pic on my profile of the failed rocket
edit: a word

info:, i know it was stupid, that's why i'm here. i've been depressed as fuck and i make stupid shit as an attempt at a hobby and to distract myself. even the cops were pissed at ""karen"" for blowing the whole thing out of proportion.

"by eating a 7 million scoville unit hot sauce infused spaghetti and going down on my wife.. i had a large group of people over that were hungry and were self-proclaimed, ""chili-heads."" i doubted their true understanding of the level of hot sauce i had and gave them a stern warning of what was to come. yet, one girl, with venezuelan heritage claimed she could take any level of heat. well, i cooked up a batch of spaghetti and put a liberal amount of ""the source"" hot sauce - google it to see just how hot this compares to most ""spicy"" things. i served my guests, with another strong warning that it was going to be hell for some, but alas they were all willing. i too would partake in dinner as well, as my palate had become accustom to this sauce and it wasn't too bad for me anymore and was a prerequisite for them to do it as well.

&#x200b;

fast forward about 5 to 10 minutes and everyone is losing their collective shit. people holding their mouths under the sink, pounding beer to soothe the pain, and our miss venezuela in a ball on the ground crying. i consoled her the best i could and offered some remedy techniques. all the while, i'm quietly laughing with my now wife (she didn't partake, smart).

&#x200b;

i wait another 2 hours to make sure no one needs to go to the hospital... we're good, most have have calmed down and are feeling a little better, including a much more humbled venezuelan girl. myself, i consume a bunch of crackers and wash my mouth out with plenty of water and booze. now, high on endorphins and, well, booze. i'm feeling like i want to get into some sexy times. my wife and i retire upstairs where we immediately start getting naughty.

&#x200b;

i go down on her and she's enjoying it, well initially. she starts to make weird noises and i ask if everything's ok, to which she replies, ""it, it just feels weird,"" but insists that i continue. another 5 minutes pass and she completely stops me, ""ok, something wrong it just feels really weird."" i comply and think nothing of it in my inebriated state, so we transition to having sex. of course, i'm enjoying myself and getting into it, man it's really sensitive right now - i think to myself, i'm tingling with excitement! huh, wait, it's now starting to burn a little. my mind's racing what could be wrong, then it hits me. ""oh shit, the fucking source!"" i exclaimed to her. we both jump off and start paying close attention to our genitals. pain building and for some reason, my johnson is starting to really hurt. i'm pacing back and forth, holding my sneaky pete in front of the fan, doing anything i can to relieve the pain. my wife clutching her vaheyhey like she's about to give birth.

&#x200b;

10 minutes pass and i'm finding absolutely no relief, but my wife for some reason is taking it like a champ. i start to panic, as i'm really burning up, downstairs. i run into the bathroom and start slashing water from the sink on my nixon. brief relief, followed by immediate pain. fuck. finally i say screw this shit: i fill up the sink to the brim and lay face first on the counter with my twig and berries fully submerged in this life-saving water. i stay in that position for a good 20 minutes. finally i retract my stanley steamer from this holy water. ahhhhhhhh, the pain has finally subsided enough to return to bed. i regaled my wife of my fateful bathroom story and we laugh for a good 20 minutes. needless to say, we waited a good day for the fire to completely snuff out until we got frisky again.

tl:dr. ate one of the hottest hot sauces in the world, went down on my wife then had sex. dick burned like hell and plunged my meat into a sink to relieve the pain.

"by slapping a girl so hard she is now deaf in one ear.  

a year or so a go i met a pretty but very shy girl on tinder, we dated, got along and then struck up a casual sexual relationship. we both had stressful jobs with long hours and just used each other to have aggressive ""stress"" sex as she called it. one day she messaged me at 1 am, she told she was very turned on and wanted me to come over. now i am a man, if a pretty girl asks me for sex i am going to pathetically come running. so up i got, had a quick shower and cycled through a wet and cold london night to her apartment (i wasn't going to pay the £35 or so for an uber). once i arrived she just wanted to fuck, she apparently had a massive argument with her ex and a long horrible day at work. so we proceeded to have sex, she usually liked it rough and liked a gentle face slap, but that night she asked me to do it harder, then harder and then even harder. her face was red and she was very evidently liking it but i was nervous, i enjoy rough sex but i was hitting her rather hard and i didn't want to bruise her face nor do any damage.

then she grabbed my head and pulled me down and bit my lip hard and said ""fucking hit me"", so i did as she asked...

after sex we were cuddling and she said her ears were ringing but she had a great time and she was in a good mood so we showered and went to bed. in the morning she woke me up by shaking me rather hard, the pillow where her head had rested throughout the night had a brown coloured, bloody discharge stain on it and she said she couldn't hear out of her ear.

i was mortified, offered to take her to hospital or that i would spend the day with her to make sure she was alright etc. i was scared there might be worse problems than the suspected burst ear drum and deep down i was scared she might hold it against me.

she went to a doctor and said she had ""fallen over"" when they asked how it happened, we stopped talking a while after that and she got a boyfriend. fast forward one year and i messaged her to ask how her ear was. she still can't hear out of it and apparently it can't be fixed :( . she was lovely about it all and said it wasn't my fault and that i shouldn't feel guilty which did make me feel a little better.

&#x200b;

**great sex though.**  

edit: for clarity i wasn't aiming for her ear and i don't think i even hit her ear, i think i still made contact with her cheek. anyway i still feel awful about it and isn't something i want to do ever again.

while at the local headshop (preparing for april 20) there was a really attractive red haired girl with quite possibly one of the most radiantly attractive smiles i have ever seen in my life standing in line waiting to be helped. as she was waiting, her phone went off and her ringer was r2d2. me, wanting to strike up conversation, told her that was an awesome ringtone, to which she replied that she is a huge star wars fan, which is awesome because i am too! we make small talk, definitely mentioning the new trailer that just was released and whatnot. we were hitting it off well, and we turned out to have so many things in common: we are both huge fans of lotr, super into gaming, specifically old nintendo console gaming and pc gaming, and obviously smoking (we were at a head shop so that is obvious). then, the absolute kicker of the whole situation was that she browses reddit! everything about this girl is 10/10 and when she walked out the door i thought my friend i was with was gonna kill me for not asking for her number. i've fucked up a lot in my life, theres no doubt about that; but i think this might be one of those fuck ups that haunt me forever.


tl;dr: saw pretty girl who is also fellow redditor, hit it off super well, didnt ask for phone number.



edit: didn't expect this to blow up at all...
for those wondering, i'm from southern louisiana, i'm not gonna go any more specific than that location. i'm pretty sure that if she reads this, she would know who i am. even the guy working in the store was telling me how i fucked up not getting your number...
also, for those taking me so literally on calling her perfect, yes i know i only met her for 5 min, i didn't mean that's she's literally perfect, she just seems like a cool person and i'd like to get to know her better if the opportunity were to arise.
also, thanks for the gold strangers!

edit 2: so to clear some things up,
yes i go to lsu. no, i actually was not at the ra shop surprisingly enough; my buddy and i were at a 24 hour smoke shop just off campus, those of you familiar with lsu should know what im talking about.

edit 3: just logged back on after spending the day celebrating. there really isn't anything to update, no hits yet. celebrated a lot before writing this so... more updates later

edit 4: so, after celebrating for a full 24 hours... people have sent me pictures of random redheads apparently who go to lsu, so far no matches. that being said... i didnt make this post to find her, i made this post because i was at a solid 6 and just felt like putting it somewhere. also, to the people saying we were gonna date/fuck/etc., no, i just wanted her number to see where things would have gone had i not been a little bitch about it. and if she did/does have a boyfriend, who cares, she could have been a great friend, who knows.",4
"by trying to teach my daughters about savings, now i may need a chocolate coins bailout. well, not exactly today. this started back in june, but it's only just now that i realize how deep i am and the evil little mogul i have created.

i'm a single dad from mexico. and every opportunity i get to teach my daughters (5 and 3) something i try to take it. and it works amazing if you put a fun little twist into it, which usually means sugar or pepperoni pizza.

now, my daughters get an allowance from me. it's a small amount, enough to get a little something from the school's cafeteria (privately owned) and then some to ""save"", which they never do of course. one night i was doing some shopping since they were staying with me for the whole month of june, and being the awesome dad that i am i needed to get the cutest unicorn pajamas i could find, marshmallows and whatever bag that contained the word ""candy"" on it in the whole store. that's when i saw chocolate coins, you know these ones(https://i.imgur.com/gvflt3t.png). so i immediately thought i could turn this into a learning experience while at the same time being their hero for giving them chocolate.

here's my thought. i'll give each of them 5 chocolate coins every monday. they can either eat them or save them as they wish. but whatever amount of coins they had remaining by next monday morning i'd take as ""savings"" and i'd give them their 5 new ones for the week plus 50% of the total amount as a bonus. so if one of them had 2 coins remaining then she'd get 5 more on monday morning, making it 7, i'd take that and add 50% more (3.5, rounds up to 4) so that girl would then have 2 + 5 + 4 = 11 coins. by just saving 2! but they wouldn't get any bonus if they saved just 1 or none. here's where people who are good at math are starting to get where this is going... but it's even worse.

the little one ate all of her coins that very first monday. i don't think she even took the wrapper off. the big one lasted until friday. weekends are rough man, you need your chocolate coins to relax. next monday i give them their 5 coins but this time they only got to eat 2 maximum a day (i needed to step in with some regulations, sue me!). by tuesday my parents come visit and the kids want to go with them and spend the night, so of course i said yes and off they went, leaving their coins behind. one night turned into 5 actually, and they came back on sunday to their 4 and 3 coins each.

""thank god my parents helped me or this would've never even worked"", i thought. they'll finally reap some rewards and maybe learn the lesson here. the big one eats only 1 coin and keeps 3. the little one eats her maximum amount allowed, of course, and keeps 1. next morning they get a big surprise.

big one gets 5 coins, saved 2, gets 4 as a bonus, so ends up with 11.

little one gets her 5 coins, saved 1, no bonus. ends up with 6.

i then saw it. my older daughter's eyes turned black and i swear i could see sweatshops filled with 5 year olds working for her while she laughs maniacally. she's up to something, i just know! and boy was i right.

that monday they started a bit of summer school. they get to see their classmates for 2 hours a day and do some random activity, the big one brings her coins for some reason, and at some point i swear i saw her smirk at me on the mirror, as if she was warning me i'd get stabbed 20 times from behind with a plastic retractile knife to cut fake vegetables with.

we get there, dropped them off and left to do some shopping. when i came back for them i noticed my daughter's coin bag was empty (remember, 2 a day max) so i asked her what happened. she smiles and says ""i sold them"", ""what do you mean you sold them?"", ""yup, they gave me real coins for them"". i was proud. i have an entrepreneur! (or the reincarnation of genghis khan, not sure yet). i asked how much she got and it comes out exactly at $44 pesos, $4 for every coin. which is about $2.2 us dollars. she actually made a profit. i buy the coins bags at the candy shop and they cost me almost exactly $1 peso per coin, she got $4 each!. here's where it all goes down hill.

we get home and she asks if we can go to the store. little convenience store owned by the neighborhood's grandpa. i agree and we go. she gives the old man her whole $44 pesos and asks for nothing but chocolate coins. grandpa has to make a profit off the damn things of course, so he sells them at $2 pesos each. that means my daughter sold 11 coins and with that money she's getting 22, double the amount! i just hope she doesn't find out i outsource my product or i'll be in trouble.

i'm so proud of her, she's making a profit and she's even outsmarting me. by friday she has already sold 96 coins, all the while eating her 2 coins a day and even keeping some money since she's only investing on 20 coins a day at grandpa's store (parents noticed and some didn't like the little shits buying 400% price inflated chocolate from her, but she kept some regulars).

yesterday was a monday. my daughter had 274 coins. i gave her 5. and 50% of that total was 140 more. she has 419 now. she doesn't even need to buy coins anymore, i'm her provider and i'm doing it for free... i need a bailout.

tl;dr - i thought about teaching my daughters the importance of savings, but i instead learned some people will take advantage of everybody, and some are happy just eating some chocolate.

"by not disconnecting from the bluetooth. i live with four roommates in college and we often throw big parties. tonight they had a ton of people over from their high school some of which i knew, some of which i didn't. i decided to chat for a few minutes, then turn in early for bed. 

i was talking to this one girl (amanda)(not her real name) who i'd met a few times before through my roommates. always thought she was cute, and especially tonight. we chatted for about an hour, and we really got along, i thought about asking her out. 

before i worked up the courage her friends arrived and she dipped to chat with them. i decided that'd be my cue to call it a night, and i went upstairs to bed. 

and, like many men out there on the internet, i often partake in a particular activity before sleeping, especially if i've been drinking, which i was. and i pulled up this girls ig for... inspiration. (call me a peeve, i don't care. i'm sure i'm about to be called everything by my friends)). she had a video showing herself jumping into a pool in a bikini. her friend counted down and then she jumped off the diving board. i watched it four or five times with the sound on low, and then switched over to a porn app that plays video. 

*but here's the thing.* as we were chatting, amanda borrowed my phone to connect to the houses bluetooth stereo and play one of her favorite songs. (i told you, our conversation had been going well.) and after that song was over i just put on a spotify playlist and didn't think anything more of it. 

except these videos were playing through the stereo now. so amanda's bikini video played 4 or 5 times, immediately followed by some pretty hardcore porn. i realized it after about 10 seconds into the second video, but everybody heard and stopped talking downstairs. and then about 10 seconds after that the conversation slowly picked up again.

so now i can just hope amanda doesn't recognize her own instagram video by audio. and that still doesn't really help me from the whole porn side of it. 

tdlr - didn't disconnect from the bluetooth and played girls ig and then porn over whole party. definitely ruined my chances with that girl, who i was chatting with. 



edit - gonna take some sleeping pills and chalk this one up to an l. gonna figure this shit out in the morning.

edit 2 - woke up to a bunch of texts, mostly people asking where i was, nobody directly asked me about the stereo thing. nothing from amanda.

edit 3 - casually asked my roommate about this morning as he was headed out the door. think i'm in the clear, at least with the general party - sounds like they figured it was one of my other roommates pulling a prank, which tbh this is in his wheelhouse for pranks. he denied it obviously but nobody believes him. think things are ok. i don't know what amanda thinks, since she took my phone and *shes* the one who connected to the bluetooth, and she's probably the only one who recognizes that video, if she even heard it. 

i have a general medium-grade anxiety from the whole thing but i guess if that's my punishment im ok.

edit 4 - she blocked me on ig.

edit 5 - aforementioned roommate found this post. he found it hilarious and told me to keep it up. we laughed about it for awhile. he's better connected to amanda and is going to try to ask around to see what she knows. nothing to lose at this point 🤷‍♂️

edit 6 - well, you guys aren't going to believe this one. turns out she was flattered, the ig block was an accident, and we have a date next week!!

lol, jk. she thinks i'm a fucking creep and probably won't be coming around anymore. told her friends, now that's my reputation with that whole group of people. leaving the post up cause i don't think i can fall any further and at least people are having fun here. i'm going to go for a walk.",4
"by whistling at my wife.. what you need to know:

my wife and i live on the 6th floor of a condo complex and the weather has been fantastic. lots of people are taking to the balconies to get some sun and relax.  we also have a small market just below where we do our grocery shopping.

here's the fuck up.

my wife needed a few things and i took this time to enjoy a beverage outside.  as i sat there drinking i noticed her come out of the store so i let out a short whistle.  think cartoon wolf with eyes bulging and tongue rolling out.  but she didn't hear it. so i upped my game, placed my fingers in my mouth and let out the loudest cat call i could muster.

wife didn't hear me, but the young lady sun tanning on her balcony did. looked at me in disgust and went inside.

i will now avoid the elevator and the balcony for eternity.

tldr: tried to whistle at my wife, unintentionally came off as creepy to my neighbor.",4
"by ordering a nsfw item through amazon and not turning off shipping notifications. i have been planning to surprise visit my girlfriend for a while recently and decided that i should buy some ""items"" off of amazon to spice things up in the bedroom.

now this normally wouldn't be a problem, except i have an amazon echo located in my parents house, along with one in my own house, but because my parents don't have their own amazon account, both echos are under my account...

~~so when one gets a notification, so does the other one...~~

so my father texted me that, ""alexa is glowing"" and trailed off. i didn't think much of it until when i got home and my echo was blinking yellow. i asked alexa for the notification, and she gave a very descriptive narration of the ""sexy"" item that had been delivered today...

and it dawned on me, that alexa ~~gave~~ _almost gave_ that same notification to my parents...

&#x200b;

needless to say, i have now disabled shipping notifications and will look into getting them their own amazon account.

&#x200b;

tl;dr

i ordered an intimate bedroom item through amazon and my parent got to hear the lovely description of the item courtesy of alexa, embarrassing me indefinitely.

&#x200b;

edit: thanks for the gold and silver strangers! i didn't expect this to get as much attention like it did.

i answered what the items were in a comment down below but here it is:

""word for word, syllable for syllable as slow and enunciated as could be ""deksias crotchless bodystocking open cup crotchless bodysuit sexy lingerie nightie"" and ""svakom powerful vibrating cock ring vibrator - waterproof rechargeable penis ring - svakom tyler full silicone clitorial vibrators vibes stimulators for female - sex toy for male or couples, black"" - as she just said the entirety of the title of the product on amazon smh. and there you have my search history, don't go too wild with it ;)""

thanks to everyone that let me know that because i heard it, the other one didn't. i'm fairly unfamiliar with how the devices work as a unit so i'm glad that they probably didn't hear what the item was. that's gonna save me a lot of embarrassment! i crossed out the assumption i made about their device hearing it, but i was on edge for the rest of the night worried that they heard it.

let this be a warning to everyone to make sure they turn off their notifications in case they don't want anyone to hear them 😂",4
"by trimming my junk. so, this actually happened last night. yesterday was my wife's birthday and as a surprise i decided to trim the jungle that resided below for some sexy time fun. now, i'm one of those men who has a slight pot belly and over the years it has gotten bigger causing this task to be increasingly difficult. no big deal. despite limited visibility i can generally feel my way through the deforestation, or so i thought. i get about 90% of the way through my task and all that's left is the front of my berries. here is where i fuck up. usually i look down and stretch/flatten my saddlebags so i provide a flat surface for the electric trimmer to glide against. in my haste i was not looking very closely and assumed the lawn was flat. unfortunately, it was not. the electric trimmer grabbed hold of a fold of skin and thrashed it like a dog playing with a toy. i felt a burning pain and immediately withdrew. now, i have nicked myself before so i imagined it was just a slight cut. as i looked down i realized this was not a tiny cut. blood was dripping off my love sac at an alarming rate. as i dab the blood and reveal the damage i am in shock. i had about 1/8 inch wound i could probably fit a pencil eraser in. i walked over to my wife and told her something happened. as i revealed my mangled manhood she let out a gasp. no sexy time tonight. we bandaged my wounded soldier as best as we could and went to sleep. today it looks better. i think it will heal on its own without the need of an embarrassing doctor visit. guys, make sure the lawn is flat before driving the mower over it.

update: in line at urgent care. thanks to those who suggested i go see a doctor. i'll post another update after.

update 2: ok, fresh out of the docs office. 2 stitches in my sac, tetanus shot in arm, antibiotics prescribed. thanks for all the recommendations and kind words. my soldier will live to fight another day.

update 3: so after reading so many suggestions i ordered a new trimmer specifically designed for the task. my dad always says ""use the right tool for the job"". i will be throwing away the ballmuncher 2000 when i get home.

update 4: thank you all! i never imagined that posting something on reddit about my balls would be so popular! i appreciate all the suggestions and kind words. i am trying to keep up with all your comments. this has truly been an amazing experience!

update 5: it's been fun everyone! i am retiring for the night and wont be responding to any more comments today. thank you!

edit: for those wondering why i didn't use a guard... i was using a guard. the skin folded and went in between one of the prongs. this was my fuckup, i didn't stretch it flat.

edit: for those wondering what trimmer i ordered today to replce my old one: https://www.manscaped.com/products/lawn-mower-manscaping-2(https://www.manscaped.com/products/lawn-mower-manscaping-2)

edit: for those who think this is a marketing ad... i promise, it is not. if the new trimmer i bought is shit ill update this post with relevant information.

edit: spelling, formatting, clarification

update 5/2/19: so i healed up real nice. i have a little scar but nothing too significant. i finally got around to using my new trimmer. i have been avoiding it out of fear from the last encounter with the ballmuncher 2000. the lawn mower works...ok. it is not as fast as the ole ballmuncher, but it did get the job done. i think it's a bit slower because of the size of the blades. it's also possible i was going slower out of fear of slicing my sac open again. the new trimmer is significantly smaller and lighter than my old one. it is easier to handle and i don't have to fight a cord anymore. i like the non slip surface on the new trimmer, however i fear it will take a dive in the toilet one day and ill need to fish it out. not sure it will survive the plunge. is it worth $60? at this time i am not sure. if it lasts just as long as my first one, then sure. so far so good. if anything changes ill update this post again. thanks everyone!

"by pulling my butt plug off the wall and ripping the entire tile off with it a day before rent inspection. nsfw.. here it is (https://imgur.com/gallery/mjd8plc)

i wash and stick it to the tiled wall in our bathroom to dry because it's handy and it makes me laugh every time i walk into the bathroom. we have a rent inspection tomorrow so i pulled it off the wall to put it away and managed to rip the entire tile off the wall with it. i've propped the tile back against the wall as best as i could and have shoved a plant pot in front of it to try and hide it. worst part is my dad is a carpenter and i'm going to ask him to fix it but i don't know how i'm supposed to explain how the tile fell off. 

""hey dad i pulled my butt plug off the wall and ripped the entire tile off in the process lmao"" 

tl;dr i pulled my butt plug off the wall and ripped the tile off with it a day before rent inspection.

**edit** 
i know it's an easy fix to put a tile back on the wall, we just attached it back on temporarily - but i want it done properly (sealed and all) so i don't lose my bond when my lease is up. partner isn't a tradie. dad is. dad costs less than paying someone to come properly fix it 🤷🏼‍♀️",4
"by accidentally paying for a very unwanted happy ending. bit of backstory: i (21 m) got money for christmas from my parents with the expectation it would be for experiences (concerts, trips, parks, etc) rather than material things. i'm an incredibly non-confrontational and generally awkward guy. i know the story sounds kind of unlikely and all i can do is promise it's true and hopefully looking at it through that lens might make it a bit more believable. also this happened within the last 24 hours but not technically today.

so i decide to use a portion of the money to go and get a massage. i'm looking at the prices and most of them fall around $80-$100/hour, but in my cities chinatown the rates are much lower, many offering $50/hour. in the back of my head a flittering of ""happy endings"" appears but i figure i don't care if that's how they get a good portion of their money, i'm just in it for a massage. plus that's probably just locker room talk and doesn't happen much in real life. so i pick a place in chinatown pretty much by chance, just wherever opened earliest as i had plans to go after i got off from work (night shift).

i take the subway down and get off to walk the 5ish blocks to the place. it's raining pretty decently and it's unseasonably warm, feels like spring despite being mid january which puts me in a great mood. great way to go into this. i reach a certain street and realize i've gone too far. weird i didn't see the sign, whatever i'll just double back. get back to the street i originally turned off of onto this street and realize i must have missed it again. a quick google later and i got the exact address, it's about a block from me. finally find the place and realize why i missed it, there's no sign stating it's a massage place and no distinctive feature that would even prompt you to think it was open to the public. just a slate grey wall with a metal door and a small sign, about the size of my hand with the address on it. this is the first time i question whether i should just go to some other place, but the rain is starting to get through my light jacket and soak my clothes so whatever i go in. i land in a tiny little landing with a sign telling me to press the buzzer on the wall. i do and after a few seconds an elderly lady opens the door and motions me in. she speaks very little english but mentions how wet i am. i fumble through a quick introduction and she grabs a towel and hands it to me. i thank her and begin drying off, apparently not to her satisfaction as she takes the towel and begins to dry me off - a pretty uncomfortable experience. i look young for my age and she asks me how old i am. i say 21 and i can see the disbelief and note her drying me off is pretty belittling but i'm used to that kind of stuff so i brush it off. 

she leads me back to the massage room and i ask if i can use the restroom before it starts. she points me to a small restroom at the end of the hall. i'll spare that part but i notice there's listerine, tooth brushes, vaseline, etc. in the bathroom. by now i'm positive this place does happy ending type stuff but mostly unperturbed as i'm just looking for a massage. so i finish up and go back to the room and the elderly lady brings in my masseuse, a mid 30s lady wearing this horrendous lingerie. she speaks even less english than the elderly lady, like none at all. the elderly lady is talking to me but i can't figure out what she's trying to say. finally i realize she's asking for the money. i hand her $50 (the price she had mentioned when i called earlier) and she says ""plus tip one hundred"". i'm sort of taken aback like how are you gonna ask for a tip double the original price. i tell her i was told 50 over the phone, she is very insistent on the 100 tip. by this point i understand what's going down more or less and i just come out with it. i say ""i'm just looking for a massage, right, no"" and do the handjob motion. she makes no motion that she acknowledged me so i repeat the statement. she keeps pressuring me ""don't you think she deserve tip? why don't you want to give tip?"". being a pushover i cave and say ""i've got $100"" and offer that. after a little more arguing she agrees to that. at this point i figure $100 still isn't an absurd price for an hour massage. 

with the payment out of the way, they leave the room and tell me to strip. now i had gotten a massage once before and they had told me to strip and i did, only for her to return and tell me she didn't mean my underwear too so she left while i sheepishly put my underwear back on. this time i wasn't going to do the same thing. plus if there was any doubt, i hoped me keeping my underwear on would clarify i was just here for the massage. the masseuse comes back in and i'm laying on the bed with the towel over my back (what i had done last time i got a massage). she motions for me to stand back up so i do and she gives me a questioning look and motions pulling off my underwear. i, for the third time do the ""no handjob"" bit but she mentions a shower so i think maybe for hygiene reasons/ relaxation they expect you to shower first, hence the two towels so i wrap the one around me and follow her to the shower. i go in and to my (minor at this point) surprise she follows me in. pretty much before i can do anything she begins washing me and i'll admit it wasn't any more sexual than say a nurse washing someone and was pretty relaxing being showered so i just went with it and tried to get back into the mindset of relaxing. that finishes up and i follow her back into the original room. she motions for me to lie down and places the towel over my still naked back. finally the massage begins and it's actually pretty decent. this goes on for in what were for sure the best 10 minutes i spent there.

at one point the massage stops and i hear some ruffling so i open my eyes and turn my head to her taking her top off. i figure this is where i draw the line so i tell her ""no no no put your shirt back on i'm just here for the massage"" but she doesn't understand. i motion to pull her shirt back up and she seems completely unfazed. she goes over to a bottle of listerine and gargles it in her mouth. it is just about the most bizarre experience i've ever had so i'm going between just shock in watching it and panic of like ""i'm about to get arrested for soliciting a prostitute i didn't even want"". she literally comes over and pulls the towel up which at this point was just covering my junk and spits the listerine into her hands and begins to give me a handjob. at this point i'm at a crossroads, like i can either just let this happen or tell her to stop, but she doesn't seem to understand or care what i'm saying and i gently move to get up and she shushes me and like gently pushes me back down and starts making ridiculous, porn-level fake moaning noises. i come up with my brilliant escape plan. from her first touching my junk to now, only like 15 seconds had elapsed but in my mind it felt like a lot more had. i fake an orgasm which she entirely doesn't buy and i hardly even try to sell. she looks at me quizically and says ""ok...?"" and i say ""ok ok ok yes"" and finally am able to shoo her out. i wipe myself down with the towels to get the listerine off me, rush to get dressed and walk out of there. 

tl;dr: my parents give me money to go and get an accidental and entirely unwanted handjob in chinatown",4
"by explaining to my 9 year old what prostitution is. so this happened yesterday. wife is still a bit hairy eyed as we recover from it. i decided to let my 9 year old watch the original dukes of hazzard tv show lastnight. it was genuine, as he has a couple die cast general lee's and he seemed real interested in watching it. adult me thought "" heck yeah, i'm totally winning as a dad right now"". so, episode one, only a few minutes in boss hog and roscoe are talking, and the word prostitution comes up, thankfully it's subtitled so there was absolutely no chance of my son missing it. in that instant i saw the look of curious cross his face and i immediately ,in my mind was saying ""oh shit, oh shit, oh shit,oh shit"" as i was trying very quickly to come up with an explanation. then it happened , my innocent 9 year old little boy says ""dad, what's prostitution?"" to which i responded ""oh, it's just a form of business that some people choose to do""....fast forward 30 minutes to the dinner table. son looks at mother and says ""mom, i think when i get older i want to get into prostitution"" my face flushed red and i could feel her eyes burning a hole through my soul. now, if i am to correct this, i will need to explain a:sex and b:sex for money to my son. the only other option is to let him keep on thinking prostitution is a viable future plan.

"by asking a bartender if he had a handjob for me. 

so, a little context.

i live in spain. i am not from spain. in spanish, we have different words that mean the same depending the country. think of it as the cookie/biscuit of latin america and spain.

today, i went to this big event they had in my city. i had to walk a lot to get there, so i was thirsty when i arrived. i decided to get to the nearest bar/pub so i could get something to drink. i enter the bar and ask for a cold tea, and the bartender gives me the can and i pay.

here's when things go wrong.

i was going to walk more, so i thought it was more comfortable to drink from a straw.

now, here's the thing. in spain, ""paji**t**a"" means straw, and ""paji**ll**a"" means handjob. 

i get close to him, and i ask him:

- *wouldn't you have a handjob for me?*

the guy looks at me, confused and angry at the same time.

+ *do i have a what for you?*

i ask again, firmly:


- *a handjob, you know.*


the guy looks even more confused. he says, in a very confused tone

+ *no.*

minding my business, i thank him and get out of the bar. it wasn't until 30 minutes ago i heard a friend of mine using the correct word for straw, and it dawned on me.

i asked the bartender for a handjob without knowing. fuck. my. life.

"by spending $300 on laundry.. **this is super cluttered and it stresses me out so i made a new post for the update:**

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9kuza2/tifu_by_spending_300_on_laundry_update/?





for reference, i'm a 27 yr old chick who is not at all rich. i grew up middle class with a very simple family. right now, i'm traveling for work for a few weeks, so naturally i expected to do laundry at some point. i figured most hilton's have guest laundry so this shouldn't be a problem. 

as i'm checking in i ask the front desk, ""do you have guest laundry or like, quarter laundry nearby?"" 

he goes on to tell me they don't have quarter laundry but their hilton does have guest laundry. i'd just leave my shit with him and they'd have it done by that evening. 

me, being the simpleton i am, thinks it's complimentary. to be fair, he should have mentioned it cost a lot of money. i mean, based on my reaction alone, that should've been some indicator that i was not the type to drop hundos on fucking laundry. christ, i just asked where the local laundromat was. of course i don't have that sort of money. plus, after he said that, i literally jerked my head back and was like, ""really? how does that work?"" and proceeded to have a lengthy conversation on how nice it was they did that and how i never did anything like that before and felt so fancy. not once did he mention cost. even after i dropped off my huge bag of crumpled up laundry he didn't say a word. hindsight, of course it cost money. but to me, in that moment, it sounded like they just did complimentary laundry for their guests. i figured most people didn't use the service since they typically just stayed at the hotel a night or two. it was probably used mostly by few people like me who traveled for work. maybe i'm dumb, but still. he should have mentioned a cost. 

so i go about my day. get back to the hotel. get my laundry and thank the girl. the guy i had talked to before was gone now and it was a new person. as i'm leaving she says, ""i'll just add the cost to your room."" 

i'm taken aback but it happens so fast that i just smile and nod and go to my room. the entire walk up i'm replaying her words in my head. cost? what cost? it wasn't until i got to my room that i started to panic. i raced right back downstairs and asked what she meant by that. she explained that it cost money to do the laundry service. they charged by clothing item and my total was $300 and some change!! the real fucking kicker is that they didn't even wash nice clothes. among the laundry was my nasty cut off sleeves gym work out shirt and gym shorts, and my nasty hole-ridden work out socks. it was weird seeing those hung up like they were a goddamn ball gown. 

now, i was raised to be polite, so i made sure to tell her i'm not at all mad at her since it's not her fault, but what the fuck???  i'm proud to say i kept my composure the entire time, but i felt like crying. i still sort of do. she gave me the number to her manager, and i sent him an email yesterday afternoon. he works on monday, so i'm definitely going to stop in and see if there is anything they can do to wipe that charge or discount it. i travel a lot for work so i have a crap ton of hilton honors points. enough for a two night stay in a nice hotel. i'm hoping i can just trade that in or *something.* my job definitely doesn't cover that cost, and i most certainly don't have that kind of dough. not sure what i'm going to do. if anyone has any suggestions i'd be grateful for help. unless i'm completely fucked.... 

tl;dr - i thought guest laundry was complimentary. it is, in fact, not. got a $300 bill when i could've just spent five bucks in quarters doing my own damn laundry. 


**update**

this isn't a super exciting update, but i thought i'd keep you all in the loop. i received an e-mail early this morning from one of the managers at hilton in reply to the frantic e-mail i sent after the ""incident."" she is ""happy to work with me on the balance"" but i don't quite know what this means yet as the e-mail was pretty vague. could be anything from a full refund, to knocking ten dollars off, or a voucher, or something like that. she also asked me what amount i could pay towards the $300 bill. 

in my head, i was like *""uhhhh how bout free-fifty yo,""* but i realized that getting away with paying a reduced rate is more than fair and she was super generous to even offer that. realistically, if i can get this down to $50, i'd be happy. i mean, i'd be happy with anything at all, but 50 bones would allow me to rest easy at night. 

so i decided to reply. 

i thought about it, and instead of listing a number i'd contribute toward the total, i chose to give her a more detailed account of what had happened. you see, email number one was written when i was tweaking out on adrenaline after this all originally transpired. i didn't do a good job of explaining how i was mislead, or how i didn't fill out any forms, and instead sounded like some frantic teenage girl who'd just gotten her first speeding ticket. so i pretty much shared the story that i did with you all, but spiffed it up with some grown-up words. at the end, i said something along the lines of, ""in regards to how much i can pay toward the $300 bill--i was prepared to spend $5 in quarters for my laundry that afternoon (haha). i'm willing to work with you on the price, but i am unable to spend anywhere near $300 for laundry.""

that's good right?! i have no idea as i'm horrible at this sort of thing. i'm so bad at balancing politeness with sternness; i always lean toward to nice, so when i try to be stern i either am not stern enough or am like winston from new girl and take it too far. i hate complaining and causing problems!! but i hate being out $300 dollars more, so i bit the bullet. anyway, i sent that e-mail maybe five hours ago. my original plan was to go to the hotel this afternoon and sort this out, but since i'd received that e-mail, i thought i'd hold off to see if we could solve it that way. if i don't hear back by tomorrow afternoon, i will definitely go down there after work. i held off because i felt like marching down there hours after getting an e-mail was a bit aggressive. i'm in houston for the week (staying at a different hotel) so it's no trouble for me to make the trip.

anyway, that's what's up!! i'm hoping she just e-mails me this afternoon, and i can be done with all this drama. shout out to all the redditors who offered to help me pay the bill. that's insanely nice of you and it fills me with joy to know there are such kind strangers in this world. however, i could never accept payment from strangers for my own fuck up. 


thanks for all the support and advice!! i really appreciate it.

"by throwing my steak out a window. last night, my wife's boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner. on the drive over, my wife reiterated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression. 

i scoffed and arrogantly informed my silly wife that i always make good impressions. 

my wife's boss is a single lady in her fifties, so it was just the three of us. we chitchatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. she laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased.

soon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. as i began to cut into my steak, i was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was.

now,  i've had my fair share of rare steak. i prefer medium, but i can handle rare. this was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. i probably could've resuscitated the cow had i tried. instead, i sat there fidgeting with my knife and fork, worrying about how i was going to get away with not eating this steak. 

claim vegan-ism? no, i'd already feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak.

just then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. as i looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head.

i knew i had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. i committed. i grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window.

here's the big time fu.  the window wasn't open.  it was the cleanest fricking window you've ever seen in your life. that is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake.

my wife - who's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like i was an alien from another planet. this look then slowly morphed into more of a there-is-no-place-on-this-planet-you-can-ever-hide-from-me expression of demonic anger. 

my wife's boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. she took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look.

i just didn't know what to say. it felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. finally, the best i could manage was ""i... i'm so sorry. i am such a clutz... i don't know... i was just cutting it.. and... it...  ... it slipped... just ask my wife, i really am a clutz... right honey?... (no help coming from that direction) ... i will clean this up... i can't believe this... i am so sorry"" etc... etc...

both women continued to stare at me like i had escaped from the loony bin, as i smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin, dusted off the steak, and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation. i knew no one was buying the story.

i knew what i had to do. i sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak. 

i remained pretty quiet the rest of the evening. my wife's only two words to me since the incident are ""i'm fine"". 

tl;dr:  tried to sneakily throw my under-cooked steak through an open window... only to find out it wasn't open.

edit: thanks kind redditors (:

update: just got the first post-""i'm fine"" communication from my wife, via text, who is at work...

""good news, boss' name and i just had a good laugh over how much of a fucking idiot u are. i hope u know u will never live this down. love u you moron""",4
"by looking to make my job easier and getting 3/4 of my department laid-off instead. this just happened last week and i am still very upset. i work for a medium sized drilling company with about 200 employees. i am in accounts payable \(ap\). my job is laymen terms was to take all the invoices, organize them, archive them, and then pay them. usually we would process about 1000/month and they would range from 1 page to 50 sometimes. the scanning was the worst part though. we would print every single invoice, then scan it, then archive it. with our copier, i had to scan each invoice separately, then rename it on the shared folder to the date and then put it in the corresponding company folder. we had 4 people doing this.

a new hire came on about 3 months prior and told us about at her old company, they would just put a separator sheet with a barcode between each invoice and be able to scan a stack of invoices and it will auto separate the invoices into separate files which we can then go and manually rename and organize into the right folder. that sounded amazing to me. that would save a lot of time and reduce the most tedious part of my job.

here is the fuck up. i tell my boss about this technology and they call the copier company to inquire about it. a meeting is set up with myself, my boss, our it manager and their sales rep and software specialist. they ask a lot of questions about the process we currently have and what we want. i answer all of it and explain exactly what we need. they tried to pitch the idea of a more integrated system, but we told them that's not what we are looking for and they seemed to accept it. i come out of the meeting excited because they tell me they can do exactly that.

about 2 months go by and i haven't heard from any higher\-ups what is going on with the new software until one day i get called into my bosses office. i come to find out that the software company took the information i gave them and went to our cfo about integrating a new system to essentially automate 90&#37; of the ap process. i am also told that i'm being laid off due to this and i find out later they laid off 2 of my coworkers as well. so essentially this company that was suppose to help me ended up seeing a much bigger opportunity to sell a much more expensive software that screwed me but saves them 150k a year in salaries. fuck.

**tldr: i had my bosses reach out to a software company to look into simplifying one part of my job, but they used the information to sell another software that put me and 2 others out of a job.**


edit: wow! didn't expect this to get so popular. yes i should have kept my mouth shut, but at the same time the system we had in place was very inefficient and was bound to change. like i would start my morning taking the batch of signed documents from the day prior, grabbing the largest ones and scanning them while grabbing coffee or browsing reddit. it was a joke and also very very verrrrry boring. i'm mostly pissed at the it manager who i thought was a friend but i didn't even realize the project he was working on the last month was to have me out of a job.

also i don't hate my boss. his hands were tied by upper management. he also offered to get each of us an interview at our parent company and i have an interview next week. it might even pay more! this experience has definitely made me a little more aware of how easily replaceable you can be, and i think im going to take the advice of other commenters and be a bit more diligent about being irreplaceable in my next job.",4
"by busting a nut in the middle of my gym. i'm a pretty fit guy, but i've been toking a little too much lately and decided i need to occupy my time with more productive and healthy habits i.e. exercising.

so today i was in my school's gym (i go to a small d3 college on the west coast) doing my usual workout routine, and i got to the portion where i do two one-minute wall sits. the first one went fine, i felt a little shakier than normal but i'm sleep deprived so i figured that was why. 

the second wall sit, however, was significantly more difficult than i'm used to. there were 5 seconds left, i was boring holes into the clock with my eyes, and my legs were shaking like a senile chihuahua's. when the clock finally hit the one minute mark, i stood up, and came in my pants.

literally.

it was so bizarre. the trembling started in my groin where the majority of the pain was and then moved in between my legs, and i just came. my dick was.soft the whole time. 

so there i was, standing up, legs crossed, probably looking like a fucking creep.  luckily my compressions kept everything...contained...but i still got a weird look or two. 

i can never leave my dorm again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 

tl;dr i got super shaky during my workout and had a spontaneous orgasm in the middle of my gym in front of several people and now i can't be seen in public anymore

edit: i left out the fact that did actually orgasm- some people are under the impression that i literally squeezed the golden glue out of my balls. if that were the case, i'd be in the hospital not on reddit

"by joking with a date i was a serial killer.. so because of circumstances beyond my control this didn't happen today.

cue my first date with a girl i met on tinder, we meet up at a restaurant and get to talking. this are going great, she thinks i'm funnier in person (when does that ever happen?!), she actually invites me to the mall to hangout more with some of her friends when dinner is over.

so after the food arrives the conversation turns a little more towards how we met (pay close attention and you will spot my mistake). she states she's glad i'm normal and not some sort of serial killer.

now i could have just laughed... i could have but i was funny remember? i replied with ""oh thanks for thinking i'm normal! but i actually am a serial killer, bodies for days buried out at the farm.""

she laughed, i laughed, i thought i did great at making it sound sarcastic.

she excuses herself to the bathroom to do whatever girls do in bathrooms on dates. it was taking a questionably long time for her to return and i was slightly worried she bailed and stuck me with the bill, my luck right? wrong.

so unbelievably wrong, my luck was worse as police officers suddenly appear out of nowhere and tell me to keep both of my hands visible on the table.

at this point i'm confused, this must be a joke. i see my date coming with a staff member and get ready for ashton kutcher to appear, no such luck.

the police ask if it's me and she says ya, the cops get me to stand up and handcuff me and walk me out, not a single person seems to want to answer any of my questions.

i'm in the car and the police are outside talking to my date for a few minutes when they get into the car with me and ask me if i told my date i was a serial killer, areyoufuckingkiddingme...

i tell them yes but i was joking.

don't admit to police you told someone you were a serial killer.

so that derailed my plans, i spent the next 5-6 hours explaining myself over and over and over that i was kidding.

i guess eventually they either believed me or got tired of hearing me speak much to my lawyers disapproval (to me speaking) and let me go and reminded me that my jokes suck.

i'm not sure how date number two will go but i'm excited to find out, also a bright side is that i have no idea who paid for my food.

tl:dr: i made a joke i was a serial killer, date doesn't get sarcasm, i spend hours in the police station.",4
"by mowing the lawn after a hurricane. hey reddit. as is tradition, this didn't happen today, rather it happened monday. 

so hurricane dorian happened. and my old man called me up to assist him in removing all the shite and detritus that was distributed all the fuck over the lawn. now. we have a shit load of trees on the property. the amount of branches, leaves, sticks, and acorns was beyond reason. after a few beers of cleaning up i got a bright idea. 

i am a lazy man, fuck doing this by hand, where is the lawn mower. my father is also a lazy man at times, so in the years since his free slave labour moved out (see: me and my brother) he bought himself a nice ride on mower to facilitate ease of rum and coke consumption during lawn maintenance activites. due to this, the old mower which has the ability to bag up cuttings instead of disbursing them was tucked away in the shed covered in several years worth of tools, boxes, cobwebs, and various other pains in the ass.

got that bad bitch out and took a gander at it. it had seen better years, the frame was bent slightly, and the little rubber flap at the back that prevents small objects from exiting the rear of the mower at a high rate of speed was nowhere to be found. likely in the same spot as my common sense and a heaping pot of foreshadowing. 

god tried to warn me. no matter what i did the thing would not turn over, however. armed with hubris and a bottle of quick start spray i got it sputtering to life, and with a chuckle to my self about how clever i was, i set to mowing. 

now. the records show in halifax there were no serious injuries due to hurricane dorian. the records are wrong. for the fateful moment i set that lawn mower to the grass, one of those little acorns was propelled at warp 6 out of the back of the mower, off the tip of my steel toed boot, and pinged my left testicle like a newton's cradle of pain. 

everything was fine for a few blissful seconds. as my molson canadian soaked neurons attempted to process the incoming genital distress beacon before my world turned white. i'm sure i don't need to tell you this next part because i'm certain i screamed so loud they heard my 100% manly cries  on the international space station. 

i dropped like a sack of lead potatoes, wailing like a wounded hyena, and promptly evacuated the remaining inexpensive domestic lager from within my stomach, thankfully managing to miss my self. 

lucky for me i never intended on having kids.

tldr: went to mow the lawn, preformed a one man genital centric final destination sequal.

edit: holy fuck my inbox. i'm trying my best to upvote all you fucks but its like im the last chick in the bar and the house lights just came on

edit: so clearly a good chunk of you enjoyed this. this shit blew up faster than a homeschooled prom king. i've certainly got plenty of tales from a misspent and currently still on going youth. so stay tuned for more debauchery from a well spoken hunk of canadian white trash.",4
"by accidently fingering an 87 year old. i worked in a hospital as an auxilliary nurse around 10 years ago on a geriatric ward in the uk, one of the duties was moisturising broken skin etc on the patients legs/ arms etc or wherever was needed.one lady (who i shall call doris) had very dry skin on her upper thigh and needed a cream on her daily to keep it from getting worse.

as i was applying the cream to her upper thigh she shifted her body because of the pain, and my fingers slipped and one entered her vagina, i was shocked and took about half a second to remove it as was a bit taken aback, i apologised about 20 times.doris just looked at me with a big smile and said, ""don't worry dear, it happens"" then chuckled and said ""it's been a while""i must have washed my hands about 30 times and questioned my career choice, colleagues thought it was hilarious.next day an old man in a hoist shit on my converse and it soaked through to my sock... i realised i wasn't cut out for this job and handed my notice in there and then.

"by doing destroy dick december and actually destroying my dick.. so this happened last night into this morning. if you dont know what destroy dick december is, its when you fap/ejaculate for every day of the month for that specific date. anyway me being the fast ejaculator that i am, i actually took the challenge. i can make myself cum in under a minute the first time if i really want to and i normally do at least twice each ""session"". i am uncircumcised and could never get my skin back when i'm fully erect (will be relevant later)

i did no fap november so on the first day there was quite a load and a huge relief. everything went alright until about the 6th day where it was becoming really difficult to get myself to cum. took too long even though that i spaced it out throughout the day. but no worries i had a genius plan to solve this. make a masturbation machine for guys. you know you've seen those ones they make for the girls with a dildo strapped to a drill or something or the other. i had my idea i just needed to execute it.

on the 8th day (yesterday), i decided to take what prisoners called a ""fifi"" and improve upon it. i took a 2 liter soda bottle, cut the top 1/4 of it off and bent the rim inwards (should have bent it outwards and taped over it instead but im getting ahead of myself). i bore a hole in the cap with a screw from the inside of the cap and duct taped over it not to prevent any leaks. i then took a rubber latex glove, making sure the fingers were inside and taped it over the end of the bottle i had just cut. i pulled a few of the fingers through the actual bottle opening (where you normally pour from). then filled that baby up with some warm water and screwed it back up. i was proud of my contraption.

it was time to put her to the test. i took a drill and placed the screw in the part where you would normally put a drill bit, squirted some lotion in the glove, stuck my johnson in there and gave her a test run.it worked like a dream. i didnt have to wear my arm out spanking it anymore, i could even adjust the speed to make me cum faster. after the first session i thought i could make it better by having it fully automated instead of having to hold the trigger down. later that night when i was going for my 5th try. i got a zip tie and strapped it to the trigger and went to town. 

this try was pretty close to the last try since i woke up late that morning and had to start later. when i came i convulsed and lost all control while in orgasm, the drill still going at high speed had torn through the glove and the plastic end came in contact with my dick and sliced it right open. i was in a state of pain and pleasure.. i made a loud scream and my roommate came barging in to check on me. i dont remember the look on his face because i was in so much pain but i do remember him going ""what the fuck"" and pointing at my dick. i was bleeding badly and i can see part of my foreskin just hanging off of my penis. i was freaking the fuck out. roommate said i needed to go to the hospital but i was reluctant considering the situation. after i while i said fuck it and he drove me to the hospital.

when they finally saw me, the nurses cleaned me up and the doctors were debating over something or the other. after a few minutes they came back to me saying that because so much of my foreskin had been cut off (the right half had actually been clean cut off, probably still somewhere in my room). they thought it was best to just circumcise me and take off the rest. now a man in pain hearing that his dick will be cut off was just too much. i was flipping balls. since this post is kind of long already i'll spare all the fine details. they ended up convincing me to get the circumcision, procedure was rather short. came home with less of my dick that i had left with. had to clean up my blood bath and threw away my invention. dont  pull a macgyver like i did, old fashion way works and stick with it.

tl;dr made a masturbating machine that ended up slicing my dick and had to get circumcised.

edit: changed ""no fap december"" to ""november"". glad i decided to make a throwaway for this lol. no i didnt think i was going to make it all the way to day 31, i just wanted to see how far i can get. was hoping to make something out of it. no more fapping for me for a while anyway :/",4
"by being a good dad to my daughter. the was last night, not this morning.  

as i do most nights, i check on my kids just before turning in myself. my daughter seemed a little restless, but nothing out of the unusual. as i was leaving her room, though, i heard her mutter something. she often just says sweet things like, ""i love you, dad"" or sometimes she talks in her sleep. either way i usually listen in. so i paused at the door and asked, ""did you say something?"" another mutter and she rolled to her side. i knelt down beside her (she has been opting to sleep on the floor lately). this time she growled a bit and her dinner of hotdogs, carrot sticks, and orange juice made a quick exit onto her blankets, hair, and stuffed animal collection. i sat her up and was rubbing her back reassuringly and she finished coating the remaining blankets and sleeping bag with what seemed like an endless supply of orange liquidy pulp. an hour an a half later we were finally getting her back to bed after a shower and a few more sessions of upchuck/cleanup/rinse & repeat. the 3 other garbage bags of laundry that didn't immediately fit in the washing machine would have to wait until morning. 

""where's the proverbial fu?"" you're asking. it's right here. see, as a dad, i like to be prepared and protect and provide for my family should situations arise when i can make life a little more comfortable in hairy situations. i'm also fairly pragmatic in that if i can avoid or mitigate the effects of a disaster i will. that being said, i'm prepared for most emergencies. i've got several boxes of gear with duct tape, batteries, rope, tie downs, flashlights, toilet paper, etc.. they've come in handy before and undoubtedly they'll come in handy again. 

being an avid reader of all things reddit, i remember from a lifeprotip post that you can help vomiting kids find the target they're aiming for by placing a glow stick in the bottom of the garbage can. well, this summer's camping trip used up all the little kid glow stick bracelets. no worries, über dad has got you covered. i'll just dig into my disaster prep stash and break out the beefy, industrial glow sticks. now what i didn't realize was that these particular glow sticks had been subjected to some pretty intense west coast heat for the last few summers. the worst thing that could happen was they no longer worked. wrong.

heading through the living room i soon found out that the components inside the stick work great. the structural integrity of the plastic stick, however, had become brittle with age and temperature fluctuations. as i bent the glowstick, the plastic immediately burst spewing forth a shower of luminescent liquid. absolutely everywhere. it hit the ceiling, the walls, full bookcases, the shoe rack, the furniture, the carpet, and the blinds. everything within a 15 foot reach was coated in a bright, neon green spray pattern that would enthrall dexter morgan if he used luminol and blacklighting. for just an instant, i seriously felt like carl sagan leaving my comfortable living room and stepping into a magical place with ""billions and billions of stars."" then reality immediately crashed back in on me when i realized that not only did i spray luminous, oily glow juice everywhere, but also flung the broken, thin glass shards from the capsules inside those sticks. so began another hour plus round of cleaning and glass shard hunting at zero dark thirty.

tldr: read a lpt about putting glowsticks in sick buckets, ended up creating a mini-universe in my living room.

edit: thank you all for the kind words, support, and my most upvoted submission. you're all great! reading all the comments made my day after such a seemingly long night. and thank you to the golden guilded cherry popper for one of my comments below. not sure what to do with it, but the gesture is appreciated.

"by not remembering to breathe. *throwaway account, because i have no intention of memorializing this fuck up in my actual reddit history.*

this happened over the past weekend. 

so, there i am, masturbating in the shower. i was sharing a guest house with five other occupants. it wasn't a vacation. it was work accommodation. we were crew on an intense television series that was being filmed in various small town locations. lots of long days and late nights. the usual shit. 

it's 20:30pm. **fuck up time.**

it was the end of a long ass week. i had to purge. so, i smoked some weed with the crew/roomies, and then took a shower. i wasted no time getting down to nut busting business once i went nude. i didn't realize just how damn long it's been since i choked the chicken, until that first stroke. i damn near moaned. 

i up the speed. my hand is practically becoming a blur. i'm so deep in the moment, or you know, just too damn high to realize, that i'm actually holding my breath the entire time. my head's beginning to feel like it's spinning. i don't stop. i'm approaching the point of no return. it's close. i can feel it. just another stroke or two to unlock the jizz gates. at that moment, i pass the fuck out. 

i wake up within moments on the bathroom floor, bleeding. at the same time, the door swings open as two stoned colleagues of mine barge in to see if the crashing sound they heard wasn't all in their heads. for the record, it wasn't. when i collapsed, i fell, back first, through the fucking glass walls of the shower. 

thus, there i was, naked in front of the two dudes i work/live with, covered in minor cuts and a load of cum. 

what will no doubt scar us all forever was my damn dick remained rock hard and throbbing when i gained consciousness. which is how those motherfuckers found me on the floor. 

fuck you, life. **fuck. you.**

*fuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyoufuckyou.*

*edit: never expected this to blow up! appreciate all the awards, you wonderful people, much love!*
