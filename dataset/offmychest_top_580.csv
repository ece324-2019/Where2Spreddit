"i did it.. 7 years ago, when i was 24, my wife was killed in a horrible car accident, leaving me (in complete shock and grief) as a single father to our 2 kids (at the time they were 1 and 3 years old). i didn't have any post high school education and was working as a construction worker. before my wife passed away, we both worked full time and were able to rent a small but nice house. but as a single working parent, i could hardly make ends meet and had to move in to a tiny apartment. that christmas, when i didn't have enough money left over to get my kids the gifts they deserved, i really knew i had to do something. i started taking college classes at night while working 2 jobs, and after five long years, i graduated with a bs in mechanical engineering and got a job making 6 figures. i bought a nice house with a huge yard for my kids to play in, built them a treehouse, and have enough time off to spend plenty of time with them. last week, i took them on a camping trip in the mountains. it's not until now that i really let myself believe that i actually did it.

edit: thank you so much to everybody! i'm very overwhelmed by all the replies. i will try to answer as many as possible.",11
"i was having lunch with my friends for my birthday, i went to the bathroom and when i came back, everyone had left.... there was a small moment where i thought 'that's okay, they're busy and i really appreciate that they came and had lunch'. that was when i noticed the package with my name on it sitting on my chair. inside was a ransom note, a blacklight, and some random puzzle pieces. what followed was a four hour epic journey around the city, solving puzzles. this included a trip into a bar where the bartender said 'i've been expecting you', and handed me another set of locked boxes and puzzles as he poured me a whisky. eventually  it finished at some accommodation they had booked for the weekend, along with the final address of a bar where everyone was waiting for me. they designed everything themselves. i was so utterly overwhelmed and humbled by the extraordinary effort they went to for me. these people are funny, smart, kind, and generous and i always feel lucky that i know them at all, let alone get to call them my friends. the world is a much better place for having them in it. 

edit: i have been utterly remiss in telling you all how happy and stoked i am for how much you all liked the story of my delightful friends. i showed my said peeps who couldn't quite believe that anyone would think they were that interesting. ergo, thank you! my friends are your friends so should you need us, just shout.",11
"the 8 year old girl next door just broke my heart. some backstory:

i'm a 24 year old guy, i love tooling around on old cars, something i've done together with my dad since i was a kid, he was all too happy to have me carry it on.

so i work your typical 8 to 4-5 schedule, and quite often i'm in the garage after work fixing up this old mustang i've been on for the last two years or so. (a completely unrestored '65 mustang that my dad has had for years, to take on now that i'm out in the world, that was a special moment). 

so one day, i started leaving the garage door open, and its to the front so pretty much everyone can see what i'm doing, people stop by, chat, say hello, its great, i always love to chat it up, especially older folks that are happy to see a young guy getting his hands dirty working hard on a classic. 

so about a year ago during the summer, the neighbors mom asked if i could look after their little girl rachel, a quiet little girl that always seemed well behaved. i didn't mind, but i said i'm really committed to working on this car, if you feel good enough to let her over here while i'm working on the car, not a problem. 

turns out they're going through a divorce, the dad works the 3rd shift, the mom's got a part time gig, evening hours just aren't good for em. ok, so this starts, and it goes fine. she's quiet, usually reading books or watching the tv i brought out so she would be around me. i always made sure to be courteous, firm, and try out dad humor every now and then. well, she starts to come out of her shell after a while and it was a joy.

i still remember when she first asked about why i was working on the car:

""why are you working on that car when you have one thats newer and works?""

""well, this car is about 45 years older than the other one, its a classic. she'll be much prettier when i'm done with her. i've been sitting in the garage helping my pop since i was younger than you! i always wanted to be like him and so i'd sit and learn and eventually he let me help.""

""oh. whenever i see dad he's always sleeping.""

""well, he's working hard to provide for you, he's working a tough job."" 

she just kind of was quiet after that. but after two or three months, she started being cheerful when she came over, always asking questions about what i was doing specifically. this part and that, why it needed to be done, what made it work. i was glad to impart knowledge, i think everyone likes teaching a bit, especially something you're passionate about. 

i started teaching her about tools, how to recognize which ones you need, what they can do on a car or around the house. she started to light up, i got the sense that besides school.. she didn't have much of a parental figure. or anyone to teach her anything about life, or anything. 

one time my dad visited in his '66 gt convertible, and i took her for a ride in it. 

i'll always remember how she smiled, saying, ""is this what yours is going to be like?"" 

""should be, but mines a coupe so it won't be quite as nice.""

""nooo, yours will be much better! cause we've been doing it!""

my chin started to wobble and i just smiled and said you're right, it will be. 

she'd really started to grow on me, i mean, it would be impossible not to let her into your heart. a bright eyed smart little girl that just soaks up everything you teach her, wants to learn, and looks up to you like that.

it made me sad, because the times i saw her parents interact they were always snide or yelling at each other, when they were around that is. this spring i started noticing the mother leaving without a uniform, sometimes dressed to go out. i came to the conclusion she quit or wasn't working, but still taking advantage of me babysitting. which i didn't mind in the slightest. 

sometimes rachel would be quiet more when she came over, but i always waited until she would open up. she'd let out tidbits like, ""mommy woke me up late at night, she was acting funny."" or, ""she came home with someone that wasn't daddy"" or the like. it would pierce my heart, but i didn't know what to do except keep being a safe harbor for her of sorts. she started hugging me more often, squeezing me as hard as she could. i'd always get a lump in my throat. 

she's just wormed her way into my heart, how when i take a break and sit down, she'll climb all over me until i give her the proper attention, every now and then when she does some mannerism or phrase she picked up from me.. even just when i ask her to hand me a tool and she picks the proper one no problem.

we had some of the best times i can remember, just tinkering under my car, her with a raggedy old sweater of mine on with safety glasses so old dirt wouldn't fall in her eyes, watching me work, asking away. one time she nicked herself on the edge of the radiator support and i picked her up and went to bandage it up. 

i told her, ""most girls your age would cry if they got that little cut."" 

she said brightly, ""now my hands are gonna get all beat up like yours!""

i didn't even know what to say so i burst out laughing (plus another lump in the throat) and hugged her and said, ""you're the best little girl in the world you know that?"" 

then a few weeks ago, her mom came over and said they were going to get a divorce, and if i could still keep watching her during the week. i told her i was sorry and absolutely, she's a delight to have around. 

yesterday she was morose, and quiet unlike she had been in a long time. turns out her parents will be separating and they'll have to move soon. she started crying and hugged me, asking if it meant she won't be able to come over anymore. i started tearing up a bit and choked out, i don't know rachel, i don't know. i hope you can. i love you, you know that? you're the smartest, cutest, best little girl in the world and i love you.""

she just cried all the harder and said i love you too. 

she even asked if she could stay with me. again i said i don't know, but i don't think it's in the cards. 

when she left yesterday i just sat down with a bottle of jack and started crying. i just can't take it. that sweet beautiful little girl that wants to be just like me, giggles when she gets grease on her, tosses on my old dirty sweater when she comes over cause she wants to help. i just want to take her up in my arms and take away that pain. she doesn't deserve to have a shitty childhood growing up with a nonexistant father or a shitty mother. fuck i just can't deal with it. it fucking tears my heart apart.

tl;dr : start babysitting a little neighbor girl with shitty parents, we have the best time together over the past year, parents are divorcing, will move away soon. fuckin hell ",11
"being the dad she always wanted. it's currently 4:30am. i was sleeping in bed with my girlfriend when all of a sudden i heard the door creak open. i opened my eyes and saw my girlfriend's daughter in the doorway. she noticed i opened my eyes and silently tip toed to me. she told me she threw up in the trash can in her room and then said she doesn't feel good at all. 

i got up and she held my hand as i walked to her bedroom and saw the vomit in her trash can. i put my hand on her forehead and she was on fire. i tried to work quickly as possible to get rid of the trash bag and fill it with a new and clean one. she ran into the bathroom and began throwing up even more. i lightly taped the door and whispered to her, ""can i come in?"" she goes, ""yeah you can, dad.""

she was extremely sick in the bathroom. my heart hurt for her cause stuff like this really takes a toll on her. 

i went through the medicine cabinet to find flu medication. once i found some, i gave it to her. 

i brought a trash can into the living room and brought some pillows and blankets out. i put on spongebob but left the volume low. i told her to come lay down and i'll get her some water. she asked me to stay because she felt so sick and was scared to be alone. 

after i got her some water, we both laid on the couch together, cuddling and watching spongebob. 

she goes, ""my real dad never helps me like this when i'm sick."" 

i didn't really know what to say. i was furious with her bio dad. 

she eventually started drifting asleep. i felt my eyes get heavy too. then i heard her say, 

""i love you dad. thank you for taking care of me.""

would be lying if i didn't say i felt tears in my eyes. i love my girlfriend's kids as if they were my own. i love when they call me dad. 

i would sacrifice myself for my girlfriend and her kids. they've given me so much and i could never repay them. 

i'm such a lucky guy. 

i told her i love her too.

edit: thank you all for the kind words, and medals! i make it a goal to reply back to everyone that comments but i'm busy today with my girlfriend and her kids! so sorry if i reply late but i promise i will get back to ya. also my dms are open if anyone needs to chat! again, thank you a lot! much love to all of you. ❤️❤️❤️☺️",11
"i eavesdropped on my girlfriend and her daughter talking together about me.. my girlfriend just got her kids back from their dads today. i'm quite as excited to have them back as my girlfriend is. those kids mean the world to me and they have no idea what they've done for me, mentally and emotionally. 

i have a fantastic relationship with her two kids. they call me dad and never by my actual name. which i'm not complaining and it felt so natural and never made me feel awkward. 

their biological dad is a very sick narcissistic person and her kids are growing up to see that now. they want to be with me and their mom full time. i've had a bunch of times where both kids cried to me in real life and over text that they want to come back and not be with their dad. i've felt so helpless but now we're gonna fight for a custody change and make my girlfriend have the majority of custody. 

anyway, after saying my hellos to both kids when i got home, i went to take a shower. the bathroom is right beside our room and her and her daughter like to watch movies in our room, which i join in on a lot of the time too. after i shut the water off i heard them talking in the next room about me. her daughter was expressing how i felt more like a real dad to her then her actual dad and that i actually pay attention to her unlike he does. he's too busy paying attention to his girlfriend and her kids, she said. she also said i take time out of my day to play with her or take her out somewhere for shopping or to get a treat. her dad doesn't do any of that. she expressed how much she loved me and wanted to stay with us. my girlfriend reassured her that we're gonna fight for her. that she loves me too. her daughter than said how i'm so much better than her dads girlfriend. she doesn't like his girlfriend. then she said she wanted to stay here on father's day and spend time with me. 

i just melted.",11
"to people all around the world. to people all around the world, 

we, hongkongers just experienced a terrorist attack planned and executed by our hong kong police force. at about 10pm today, our police force rushed into our railway system in prince edward station, got in to the carriage and indifferently beat up all the people in it regardless they are protesters or simply passengers. they ignored the weapon guidelines and fired tear gas indoor in the carriage which is in fact lethal. also, they beat up innocent people causing them seriously wounded. some passengers kneeled before them asking them to stop but the response they got were beaten ever harder. meanwhile, the police haven't arrested the passengers after they got beaten up, showing that the only purpose of their brutality was to sort their anger to violence but not dispersing the crowd. 

we, hongkongers are experiencing a humanitarian crisis and we hope that people all over the world can help us in anyways you can think of. thank you and we will stay strong.

"you're not ugly. you just look like you.. i photograph a lot of people. almost everyone believes they are ugly. your grandmother. your child. your best friend. most models. most actors. maybe even you.

""oh, don't take my photo, i'll break your camera!"" laughs the 80-year-old grandfather. when he dies a few months later, his grandkids will treasure this reminder of his ""ugly mug.""

""please delete this,"" says a dear old friend. she looks beautiful. she looks like herself. she's been captured in a moment in which she is utterly comfortable in her skin. and she hates it.

""oh god,"" i said, because i had to get a professional headshot for work. ""i have a face like a slapped ham,"" i told the makeup artist i hired because i'm so hideous that i can't bear to have photos of me around. the selfie i took of ""the best it's ever going to get"" is my husband's iphone background.

you will never see yourself with the love that others have for you. that's what makes a person beautiful, not angles or contours. you will never be objective about your appearance. but fortunately for you, your friends and family are never objective, either: they're biased to see you through the way they smile when you walk into a room. they want every photo of you they can get their hands on, because each photo is tied to your memory.

you're the worst judge of your appearance. trust me. you look fine. the camera loves you. now take a picture.",11
"audrey i know you sneak into my room at night.. audrey when we found you, you were 1/2 dead and 100% feral. i'm glad you grew out of attacking everyone. only took 4 years. i'm glad you've learned to allow the occasional family friend to pet your head....only the head anywhere else and you bite and that took 8 years. i've accepted that you don't really like humans and are happy just doing your own thing. but can i tell you a secret? i know you come into my room at night and snuggle me. you're not exactly sly. first of all you weigh like 20lbs. you're a fat cat. so i can feel when you walk all over me. also girl you purr like a freight train when you're happy. and you tend to drool on my face when you stare at me. you always come in once you think i'm asleep and bail when i start to wake up. you're not as sly as you think you but that's okay. i love you very much and it makes me so happy you show me love in your own special way.

"there's an engagement ring hidden in my house right now.. my boyfriend and i were on our phones, looking through email. he was trying to find a confirmation for a thing we're doing tomorrow but couldn't. i grabbed it and went to type something in the search to bring it up, and i got a glance of an email from an engagement ring company with the subject ""order confirmation"" in his updates inbox. i froze. he froze. and then i proceeded to pretend like i hadn't seen it. 

so a few minutes later we're on the couch and we both just start kinda... giggling. and couldn't stop. and he was like ""why are we laughing?"" and i was like, ""i don't know"" and he was like ""...but you do know,"" which led to *more* laughter, cause we both obviously knew.

and then i asked if...it was here. he nodded. and then i asked if it was hidden. he nodded. and then i asked if we could play the hot or cold game, and he said ""absolutely not"" lmao.

so that's how my evening is going. i'm utterly giddy. and soooo impatient haha. i love him so much and this isn't a surprise because we regularly discuss the fact that we're going to be married as soon as it's financially possible, but having the actual ring *here* feels so cool. i can't wait to say yes.",11
"my 95 year old mom died this past week. she's from europe, lived during wwii time and loved to tell her story. i'm her only living child left and hardly anyone left for her. no big funeral. so i'm telling her story for her now. i think she would have loved that.. my mom just died. she was 95. she had such an incrediible life. but she had a small family, is from europe and has out lived most everyone in her life. i and my family is all she has left. she used to love to tell her story, especially of wwii days. if you started her talking about that she would light up. so here's her story, her sort of funeral. she would have loved to know so many people were listening. thanks for listening.

my mom was born in 1923 in saporoahje, ukraine. her dad was a professor and her mom had come from latvia to work near the university. mom had an older sister and a younger brother. she attended university for one year and wanted to be a doctor. but times were getting very hard. they had to turn over everything in their house and used to have to wait in line for a whole day for a baked potato ration. communism was taking over. mom's dad refused to become a communist. the soldiers were moving in and her parents, her and her sister fled. first to poland for a year and then onto germany. her brother was sent to latvia to be safe from being forced to be a soldier. she never found him again. my mom was the only sibling that had attended university and the only family member that also spoke german fluently and polish. she got a job in erding germany at an air force base to support her family  when it was still the luftwaffe training airfield. she was 18 or 19. she spoke such fluent german, the only one in her family to do so, and her father's parents were swedish so she had fair skin, very blond hair and blue eyes and they never suspected she was ukraine. my mom lived with a german family and they had taken her in as their very own. she had her family living at another location. she had made friends with other german women and one in particular was her best friend who had black hair and everyone called them salt and pepper. in 1945 the air force base was seized by the u.s. airforce and used as an air depot, air base and air station. she said her and her friends all thought americans would be very distinguished but when the they came, they would call out ""hey blondie"" and were not at all what they expected. at that time she met my dad who was an american air force soldier stationed there during wwii. for him it was love at first site. for her it wasn't bad but she didn't think anything of it. at one point she had agreed to meet him to get him off her back to and never planned to keep the date and hours later he was still waiting outside. from then on they were together. they attended lots of military dances together and she has often said that although it was war time, it was some of the best times of their lives. i'm told of a story where my dad had hitchhiked into some other town all day to buy my mom her very first christmas present. it didn't go without some nervous times. her and her girlfriends used to walk and often have to take cover when enemy planes flew over. one day she happened to be wearing a red dress when it happened so she was taken away from a table my mom and dad were at together, to be questioned if she was signaling the planes. their common language they both spoke was german and that's what they spoke to each other their first 5 years together. when she married him at 23 years old, her white dress was sewn out of white silk parachute. they married on christmas eve but by some old paperwork i found, states he wanted to be married on christmas day. my dad often bragged about how there was a bar made out ice that you could skate up to and their honeymoon was in garmisch and when it came time to settle the bill, the air force said it was on them. sometime during this whole time, her sister fell in love with a jewish man. they had 2 girls. he was killed in camp so my mom helped to hide those girls who were half jewish. those girls were never told their dad jewish was until they were old themselves as their mom had always been afraid people may be against jewish people again someday. mom was never clear to us the timeline on when this happened or where. when my dad's time in the military was done and he was honorable discharged, they were to leave on a ship to america with others. my mom was to leave ahead with other european wives, but friends bought her champagne the night before, that she had never drank before and thought it tasted good so drank quite a bit and was so sick the next day she missed the boat. literally. so my dad got her on the one he was on. they rode the ship for three weeks and the whole time my mom was sea sick. my dad couldn't stop eating.

they arrived in new york and then chicago and my mom couldn't believe how you could just buy things at the store. they were to make their final destination in japan as my dad was offered a civilian job on a military base there. but they stopped off in marshfield, wi, which was a small farming community, to see my dad's dad and his dad begged him not to leave and they never did. for years i grew up hearing how my mom never liked marshfield. she liked cities better. but to dad it was home and that's where he would like to stay.  my mom studied and took her citizenship test and became an american citizen in 1951. she was often quoted as saying america is the best place on earth. she just said it again to me last week. my mom, having seen how you could buy things at stores, wanted to get a job as soon as she arrived in marshfield. she got a job at a shoe factory that was piece work. meaning you got paid for every piece sewn. she had told me she was very fast and their top worker and she worked there right up until her first child was born 7 years later. they had waited so long as they could not afford children before that. during that time, my dad took out a loan and brought my mom's family to america as well even though the first five years of their marriage they couldn't afford to own a car or refrigeration. her family chose to settle in chicago in the ukraine section as they still spoke no other language and felt more at home there. i'm told her father was one of those men you would see sitting in the park playing chess and one day while doing that, had a massive heart attack and died.

my mom was pregnant with a second child that ended up dying while in the womb and she had to give birth to her. she didn't want any more children after that but after time my dad convinced her it could be different and she had another healthy son. when she became pregnant with me she started to hemorrhage and the doctors put her to bed rest. it wasn't stopping and the doctors told her i would never be born and if i was there would be so many things wrong with me so she might as well get up. she wouldn't listen and wouldn't give up and stayed in bed for 6 months. she also wouldn't take thalidomide even though they wanted her to. she wanted to take nothing to take the chance of harming me. the last 2 months she stopped bleeding and was able to go on to have a normal pregnancy. when i was born she said my dad cried because i was a girl. i suspect it was also because i was born healthy.

when i was in school, they needed a new car. so my mom got a part time job at a new store that had come to town called shopko. eventually it led to a full time job and she was head of her department for 18 years until her retirement. between the 2 of them they never in their lives made over 20,000 a year. but the house i grew up in, which was their second house, was paid off as long as i can remember even in my childhood. they never had a car loan. only paid cash. we would take driving vacations once a year and i felt spoiled at christmas. always had plenty of food. my mom was the one who paid the bills and budgeted and i remember her having a special envelope that she would put money in and once a month, fill the freezer with meat on sale from the money in that envelope.

during those 18 years my second oldest brother started showing signs of alcoholism and although they did everything in their power to help and support him, years later it took his life.

when my mom retired they traveled around to every state. many of them more than once. they mostly took tour buses and had a ball. their house was filled with souvenir coffee cups, so many coffee cups, from every place and mom would get souvenir sun visors, the kind with no top to it. their favorite place was vegas. i'm not sure if it was dad's favorite but he just loved seeing mom have so much fun. she loved the buffets and playing the slots, one time she called me at 11:00 p.m. because she had won $110 on the nickel machine. dad thought that wasn't enough to warrant a call but she didn't care she was so excited. another story they had told that makes me chuckle every time i think of it was how they went to an all girls dance show only to have the girls in the end pull off their bottoms to reveal they were actually men. i'm sure that was a huge shock to someone of their generation. but they laughed about it. during one of those trips my dad was on and escalator that suddenly stopped and he fell and hit his head. a week later he had a seizure and from then on there was a steady decline. my mom took care of him as long as she could. even after breaking a hip, after i had taken him in for a period while she recovered. i don't know how she did that. i lived 2.5 hours away and my oldest brother lived in the same town but she did it mostly all on her own. i suspect now to keep a secret just how bad it was so no one would say to put him in a nursing home. when it finally got so bad he had to go to a nursing home, she would take a taxi ( she never drove since coming to america) every day to be with him and towards the end feed him at least one meal a day.

some years later she had a house fire. after everything was fixed she moved back in but i started noticing some looping of sentences and questions and i started having to pay her bills and such. looking back i think she had a small stroke during that house fire time. she was incredibly fiercely, adamant about staying in her home. you have no idea how much, so we tried to allow that for as long as possible. she also said she would never, ever live with one of her kids as she tried to do that with her mom after her dad passed and it didn't work. but when she was 90 it was getting worse. at this time i was living 2.5 hours away. she was supposed to go for a physical one day so i asked her friend to help get her there. that morning her friend found her laying in the bath tub. she had been there for a few hours. she had fallen and although she brought a phone in it was out of reach. her friend helped her to bed but she was sick and wouldn't eat so she called an ambulance. there they found scar tissue that should she had had a stroke at some point. i'm wondering if another minor one during that time as her memory seemed worse. they had her in rehab there and when she was to be released i brought her to live near me in assisted living. it was a beautiful place and i thought she was going to love it. but once there she would have no part of it. it i wasn't there she would call me literally non-stop 24 hours a day. she called the police. she kept on insisting on going back to marshfield. the assisted living said she actually needed much more care than assisted living and needed long term care. dementia had settled in much more during that time. my oldest brother who still lived in marshfield said to bring her back. he became legally in charge of her and found long term care for her. she fought it hard at first but then settled in. during that time my oldest brother died of pancreatic cancer. i was her only child left now. she could remember other things but that. that she just wouldn't let herself remember. at first they told me to lie about it but he had told her about it before he died so she kept asking how he was and being agitated. the nurse said it wasn't working to protect her. so i would have to tell her over and over again. sometimes within a 5 minute period. and every time it was like the first time she was hearing it. eventually when i told her she wouldn't get so upset but rather wonder why she didn't remember. i said her brain just didn't want to. not long after his death, my husband i were transferred to austin, tx. i worked on getting her moved here, which proved to be much harder and much more red tape than i thought. the day before we picked her up she said she was scared but said she would trust us. the morning we picked her up and had a 3 hour drive to the airport, she didn't remember what we were doing. i held her hand while my husband drove and had her talk about germany. i was slightly panicked because you have no idea how feisty she can be and fight back. i literally made sure child safety locks were on. but as the hours passed she hadstarted remembering what we were doing and while on the plane she said she never thought at her age she would be on a plane again. surprisingly for the most part she took the move here well. but i came to see her nearly every day and she kept saying how nice it was that we lived so close to each other now. she has had several health problems in the past, arthritis in her hands and very,very bad in her shoulders, a broken hip, hiatal hernia, and advancing dementia, etc, etc, but she was still walking in a walker. but in january she started complaining of a sore hip area that ran down her leg. x-rays revealed very advanced osteoporosis and a fractured pelvis. it showed she had old fractures there in the past but this was a bad one. it also revealed a fractured arm just below her horribly arthritic shoulders that she had never said anything about. doctors don't know if it was an unreported fall or that her osteoporosis is so advanced just sitting too hard could have caused it. she used say she had aches and pains but that went with growing old. after days 3 in the hospital, at 95, they didn't want to do surgery. especially since it showed some heart irregularities. she went to a rehab and skilled nursing place just down the road from me and since the hospital and all through that time i spent all day, every day with her and i'm so glad i did. for a while she was doing better but then a decline started happening. i think she knew it was getting close because even before the hospital she couldn't tell me often enough how much she loved me and often asked about the family and how everyone was doing. she knew my son was trying to get his post college graduate job here ( he moved with us) and kept asking if he got it and when he got his dream job she would say there, now all your family is set. she had started refusing to eat. would spit it out and cover her mouth. saying i don't eat anymore. one time i said "" mom if you don't eat, you won't survive"". she shrugged and said i've lived a good long life. then a week ago she started refusing her meds. she would spit them out even if they were crushed and put into something for her. she would wave her arm and say no! so now she was getting nothing for pain. when my dad was failing she had a dnr put into place and no feeding tubes etc. she said he wouldn't want to be kept alive that way. so when she moved here i found in her papers she had made one out for herself as well. i was legally her guardian but respected her wishes. she had kept saying no food, only drink. so i could at least get nutritional drinks in her. she'd have some not so bad days and one day while laying in bed and we were looking out the window, she said i wish we could do something together. my thought went to the fact that she was pretty weak and was in a wheel chair now if she did get up and how would i take her somewhere. so i said what should we go do? but then she said that's okay, just being here together is all i need. i did take her walking outside in the wheelchair another day and was going to go on an adventure but she just wanted to go back in. i think she wanted something she knew her body couldn't handle anymore. one day she wouldn't drink any more. and that went into the next day. they ordered hospice and that would have involved morphine for pain. they felt she had some time yet as she was still having plenty of output but i had a feeling. i crawled in bed with her and held her hand and stoked her hair and forehead. if i stopped at all she would gesture to continue. she would kiss my hand. and reached for us to give a kiss. i started to talk about some happy memories but she gestured me to stop. so i just kept telling her how much i loved her. the nurse had come in at one point and checked her oxygen and such and said she was okay but i felt a panic that hospice should be starting. it was evening now and hospice was starting in the morning. but then we were all alone, and suddenly her breathing changed and she got a look in her eyes. i knew, so i stayed by her side and kissed her hand and told her how much i loved her and that would we would all be great and happy and that dad was waiting for her. her hands turned blue and she took several more breaths and was gone. it happened so fast. it was just her and i. and a part of me is glad that even though she as in pain, she went the way she wanted. taking nothing.

i know this was very long winded. but i felt such an incredible woman like that with such a long life, deserved to be told about at her death. she used to love to tell her story. especially her european days and she would have thought it was cool to have so many people listen. and there was no one to tell anymore. thank you for listening. i miss her already. per her wishes she is being cremated. as a memorial, i am thinking of mixing mom and dad's ashes into one container, and anyone who wants to go with us, go with their ashes to vegas. go to the buffets, play the slots, buy the souvenir visors and coffee mugs. go do something together.

edited:  i made a comment below but wanted to make sure all saw it.  i saw some comments asking for pictures so i put together a few of my favorite and some documents with a link. i hope it works. i cannot even begin to put into words how much all your kind words have meant to me. and to her. i just know she's reading them with me. and i'm eading each and every one. and i am ready others sharing loss and grief and worry of their own parents and grandparents. i'm so sorry you are going through that. but i'm so grateful there is a place that we can share kind words for eachother. some times, when you are out in every day life, at the grocery store, getting gas, you encounter people that may be feeling loss, or about to have loss. and they are going about their every day life and no one to share this with.  it has helped to share her story. when i think back, i wish i had taken even more time and heard even more stories but i'm so grateful for the ones i have.  and she would have loved it more than i can tell you that so many people have read her story. you have helped my heart. and i cannot thank you enough.

"yesterday i took a shower. the first since 9.30.17. no one gives you awards for taking a shower. but for me it was like climbing a god damn mountain.

&#x200b;

almost a full year ago, i was raped and left bleeding outside a bdsm club in san francisco. i was a sophomore in college, a band kid, an amazing job, and had a good life set for me on the west coast. until this happened.

i thought i had gotten my period the next morning- i would find out it was actually tears and open cuts inside me when i decided to go to the hospital. my chest was bruised so badly the mark didn't go away for almost 2 months. i had been badly hurt, and was put on anti-hiv pills. my mom flew from across the country to stay with me. after a few days, it was decided that i would move back home to heal, and reconsider school in the spring.

i was quiet, i slept until 3 in the afternoon, and my nightmares were horrible but the medication for the nightmares made me suicidal. most of all, i **hated** my body. i would wear the same outfit 3 days in a row to avoid changing, or change in the dark. the first time i washed my hair was in january, in the sink, crying in the adult psych unit. the nurses washed my hair with buckets over the sink and i felt like i was drowning.

&#x200b;

i wash my body under my clothes with bath wipes, a product meant for the elderly. i manage to wash my hair once a week, or i aim for once a week. the shower is scary.

&#x200b;

but yesterday i did it. i stood half-in, and let the water hit my back, and the top of my head, and it felt like acid at first but i stayed in there for a minute and a half. i covered myself fully in the towel and put my back against the mirror. i put clothes on.

&#x200b;

**i finally fucking showered.**

&#x200b;

will i do it again? i don't know, because the day it happened is coming up and i can already feel myself sinking down into the anxiety, the fear, and the depression of my ptsd. i climbed up one mountain but there's an entire range i have to get through.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: wow, i am blown away by everyone's kindness. i understand rip inbox now. and thank you, anonymous stranger, for the gold. i've been trying to talk more often about what happened, because if it stays in my head i go mad about it, and my ptsd goes into bad places. and as a woman, i need to tell my story, or the rapists win. i just started therapy again, which i'm fearing but going into with my head up. there is.....so much i want to say but it's near midnight. i hope to respond to as many people as i can in the morning :)


edit 2 (nov 26 2018) : i am blown away by your support, reddit. i still receive pms and they help me through the days when its even harder to get up and live. i have been able to shower three times since, thanks to float therapy. i cannot believe how amazing it is- and how much it has helped with regular therapy. i go every other week due to the cost but when i go i can shower afterwards for some reason? my guess is that the sensory deprivation in the floating chamber helps separate me from my mind and my body and i can allow myself to feel nice things, like warm water and lemongrass soap. happy holidays, heres to recovery for all <3


edit: june 25th, 2019: this post is still going around....i get a few messages every few weeks. it's a weird feeling, that people still read it and that people i don't know believe in me. on good days i feel great, but on bad days i feel like i'm letting strangers down....

i am trying to get into a residential program right now. it's out of state and there are many man hoops to jump through with insurance. but it's one step closer to getting better. i found tattoos to be healing, but it's hard to save up when living on ssi. 

as for me...things have gotten worse in many ways, but they've also gotten better. i'm back to showering out of a bucket and the sink. i still feel as if my body is some strange creature. but i wake up every morning. there isn't that immediate fear whenever i hear a door open. i have less nightmares. i collect furbys. i am trying to build a life outside of my trauma- i joined a band, i saw a new primary care doctor, i even started saving for a trip to the netherlands in may...

i started living. i guess i figured out how to move on.",11
"i'm ugly. i get it. stop telling me that i am ""lucky"" for having an attractive husband. i'm a worthwhile person, too.. i'm average looking at best. many even find me ugly. it is what it is. i can't say that i'm ""over"" the fact that people find me ugly because being physically unattractive has gotten me rude comments about my appearance for most of my life. and i know it's not just people being mean. when i'm out with my attractive friends, i notice how people treat them very differently (in a positive way). it's a level of privilege that i'll never experience, which sucks, but it's certainly not my friends' faults. 

where i *do* get upset is when people feel the need to comment on how ""lucky"" i am. my husband is often jokingly called the third hemsworth brother. he's a good looking dude. i don't disagree with that fact at all. when people meet my husband for the first time i *always* get comments. ""you're so *lucky* you managed to get a guy like him."" or ""that's *your* husband?"" or ""oh, you've been together since high school. *now* it makes sense."" like, wtf?

some of these comments could definitely be innocent enough except for two things. first, their stress on certain words that clearly imply that they think he's way out of my league. secondly, it's never ever the other way around. people never make comments like that to my husband about how ""lucky"" he is for snagging me. 

the worst time was one day a few years ago when i was waiting tables to pay my way through college. i had been working at the restaurant for over a year at that point. my husband came in by himself and sat in my section, so we could sort of ""hang out"" (we both had really busy schedules back then, so we weren't able to spend much time together). several of my female coworkers (and even some of my gay male coworkers) kept pointing out the ""hot guy who looks like liam hemsworth"" sitting at table such-and-such. they kept telling each other about him and encouraging each other to walk by his table to ""go check him out."" it was kind of funny at first, until i told one of them that he was my husband. ""he's *your* husband?"" the coworker asked incredulously. next thing i know, i'm overhearing my coworkers say shit like, ""yeah, that's apparently *cnyrxx's* husband. like, how and the hell did she manage that?"" and other similar things when i'm walking by them to get to the kitchen/my tables. i felt like crying before the day was over.

i wanted to get this off my chest because i just got another comment like this today. i don't know if it's because i'm feeling particularly insecure today since i'm about to start my period, but jesus christ. i'm a fucking worthwhile person, too, and there are things about me that make my husband fucking lucky to have ""caught"" me, too (to which he whole-heartedly agrees, but i digress). 

i'm just sick of it. and i'm sick of being made to feel like i have no value as a human being because i am not physically attractive. 

people suck.",11
"i witnessed a love story unfold over a few months outside the bedroom window of my townhouse.. i f 26 suffer from chronic depression, and some related complications such as low self esteem, body image issues and insomnia.

some months ago i heard a noise outside of my bedroom, like the sound of someone running. so i get up, a rare moment of curiosity. sure enough, at 3am there's this hell fat dude jogging, he's got a jumper on and headphones, looks like he's out there jogging for fitness. probably too shy to jog in the day, little did he know i was up and awake and watching. i thought to myself, heh, he'll probably give up tomorrow.

the next day i didn't see him, didn't think much of it, to be honest i forgot about it after that

three days later i hear some jogging outside my window, again in those ungodly hours of the night which have become my solace. sure enough, it was that guy again. again i thought he'd give up, but the next day he was back, and the day after that as well. at this point i was still skeptical, but i was like good on you dude, you've exceeded my ability to commit at least. 

over the next week he kept returning, he only missed two days. i have to admit, i became way too invested in this stranger's journey of self improvement at this point. i came to calling him danni in my head, dunno why, he seemed like a gentle dude and i liked that name for him. i found myself looking forward to seeing him run every morning. now i have to mention that when i say run, i mean he runs for like a minute or two and then walks until he can breathe again. most would laugh but i found it admirable. i could run way further than this guy if i had to but i'd go home the moment i lost my breath or felt uncomfortable, danni is repeatedly exposing himself to this, over and over. he's on a mission, he's also the most meaningful thing in my life at the moment.

a month passes from when he stated, and to be honest i kinda lost interest a bit. i found myself resenting his orders more self motivation than what i have. however just as i was becoming aware of this feeling he stopped running. to be honest he had not really lost any weight and his only sign of progress was that he could now run further than the view from my window could afford me line of sight. after a few days when i noticed, i genuinely felt sad.

another month passes and my sleep has drifted further and further into the morning hours, this is pretty usual for me. one day i stay up particularly late-early and as i go to close the blinds because the god damn sun is killing me, i spot danni running! he had not actually stopped running, he'd just started doing it at normal hours! this was the first time i felt joy in about 2 weeks, i felt elated, i wanted to shout out to him, i didn't.

now i was enthralled. i had to see him every day. and sure enough he did keep showing up, almost every day. there was this one period of maybe 4 or 5 days where he didn't, but after that he started up again and my respect for him was solidified. here is this man, a painting of what society would describe as soft, a loser, at the bottom of the social ladder, but that's not what i saw. i should say though that it might sound like my admiration was becoming romantic, but it really wasn't like that. i admired him from a distance as a sort of role model whom i'd never want to meet less that illusion be shattered. in my mind he was the embodiment of hope, if i met him he'd collapse like a quantum particle or whatever and become a very real very flawed human. 

after this roughly two more months pass, he has his ups and downs, days skipped, days where he's just walking. all the while he's started losing weight, but he's still got a longgg way to go to looking healthy. 

then one day , around the time he'd be running by my house i hear the giggling of a girl. now at this point i was more checking in once a week to see if he was still running, he didn't have a perfectly regular schedule, so i would have to watch through the window from my bed for a while whenever i wanted to see him otherwise i might miss him. on this day though i had to go check what this girl was laughing at. i'd be so heartbroken if danni was being bullied, i mean who would just openly make fun of someone for being fat and trying to do something about it today? instead i see danni walking alongside this girl. wow danni! she's like wayyy out of his league. i don't really buy that league thing entirely but damn this girl is pretty and she's wearing all that tight fitting sportswear, she seems like she's got that amazing sense of style where she always looks great, i've always envied that. i hear danni talking to her, and that's the first time i heard his voice. he's just chatting, she seems like a really bubbly kind of person, nothing he's saying is that funny, but when she laughs you can see him beaming with pride. her laugh clearly makes his day but tbh it's pissing me off. at the same time i feel really happy for him, but i can't help but feel cynical, he's probably never going to be with this girl. she's just using him because she's deeply insecure (like me) but instead she seeks attention to try to fill the void, while i guess i embrace it like that old friend you love to hate and hate to love.

over the next weeks this girl occasionally joins him, out of 5 weeks she joined him maybe 8 times, while he was now running every single day except weekends. occasionally i could glimpse snippets from their conversation when they happens to walk past my window instead of running, sometimes they were just quietly walking but mostly she was her bubbly self and either chatting away about nothing or listening to him, occasionally laughing and giggling. 

i have to say, and this completed surprised me, but at first danni, who's still obese at this point was able to run further than the girl! she had a gorgeous body , like most days she'd wear a top that revealed her midriff and it's not like you could see her abs or anything but her stomach was quite flat, i guess she was unfit though! she quickly caught up though and was able to run as far as he could as she stated to come more regularly. two months in and she was joining him three times a week. i still don't know their relationship, i think they are friends, i saw them hug one time when they were both super out of breath, but that's the only time i saw contact between them. they'd taken to sharing earphones with like a splitter thing, i thought that was kinda cute. usually i fucking hate cutsie couples but thinking they weren't a couple let me see past that i guess. during this time the girl also spotted me watching them and i stopped watching them, but i could still hear them outside sometimes. i had changed my mind about her though, she seemed okay.

the thing about my depression is that sometimes you go long periods of feeling nothing, and then out of nowhere emotions return in this flood like an enormous dam has been holding them back and now they are out, so one morning when she mentioned her boyfriend it hit me way harder than it should have, i wasn't ready for it! she said ""oh my boyfriend and i are going up north for the long weekend so i won't be able to come on monday."" i couldn't hear danni's response. i've been in both of their positions, assuming he's madly in love with her. it sucks. 

another month passes and the girl is now only showing up twice a week. i've started watching them again but now it's more of a habit. i'm happy for the guy, he's starting to look healthy, he's still got a bit of fat but man has he come a long way. she's looking amazing as always. then on day i spot the cutest moment. it seems like they'd been pushing each other to run further and faster, and on this day i see them in the park that's about 100 meters or so from my house, at first she's bent over seemingly heaving for breath, he's pacing around, looking up, trying to catch his breath too. they have one of those chats where it's far more breathing than words being spoken, but i can't hear them, only see them. then he gently grabs her hand and holds it to his neck, i guess he asked her to check his pulse, she shakes her head and smiles while holding her fingers under his jaw. he then does the same to her, and it they look at each other for a moment, just standing there for a second index finger or each other's pulses, breathing. i thought this was super cute and i wish i had been closer and taken a photo. 

that was 17 days ago. i decided to write this story because yesterday i watched them both finish their run in that same park, totally out of breath. the girl sat down on the grass and after a minute the guy offered her a hand to get up. she took his hand and as soon as she got up she went for a hug. they hugged for a good 20 second kind of slowly swaying. when they broke apart he held her by the shoulders, and then they got close again and kissed. 

danni, i'm going to stop watching you, i wish you the best of luck and if you're reading this please know that you've been the only meaning in my life for months now, i'm so happy for you and i sincerely hope things work out for you and the girl. perhaps you were doing this all for her from the start, but even if it doesn't work out with her please don't stop running. i'm not even slightly jealous of you two, or your progress. 9 days ago i started running at 3am and i've not missed a day.



edit:
thanks for everyone who has read, and all the up votes and comments and awards! i honestly thought this post might die in the weeds as many of my others have, i didn't expect this kind of response. i created a new account because discrimination against those with mental illness is real. anyway it fills my heart with joy that i could inspire even one person to get out there and make their life better for themselves, and i think danni would feel the same! at first i started by up voting and reading all your comments and replying to every person who rewarded me an award or made a comment, because you all deserve to be noticed! it does get a bit overwhelming though, but i will still read every comment even if i don't respond, that's a promise!",11
"i found my husband's secret stash.. we keep no secrets from each other (except for keeping the door closed when we poop). i went looking for one of our old credit cards. he has a few little hidey holes for important stuff, he's like wall-e, so i went to his bedside table, bottom drawer, where he occasionally keeps old financial stuff. 

and there it was, just staring at me. i had no idea. 

every card i've ever given him, every cutesy love letter, every sappy post-it. stacked neatly in the back corner. some in envelopes, some out. over six inches high. every card i fretted over, every page of handwritten 3am hopes and dreams. i'm a writer, so words are important to me and they are the way i express myself when it's difficult to do so verbally. he knows this. 

people always say it's so nice to see how happy we are. that we're ""that couple"". i feel it. it's not like we never left the honeymoon phase. we had some issues for a while, most people don't know, but we pushed through and we're both better partners because of it. i never thought i could be this happy. in a million years, i never would have dreamed that i could have this kind of loving, challenging, supportive, affectionate, sexy, silly, perfectly complimentary relationship. i feel lucky every day to have found this wonderful man and i will never, ever take it for granted. 

but seeing that stack of cards, even though it may seem small to some in the grand scheme of things, just really made me happy today. i told him i loved him for the first time in a rambling valentine's day card, 7 1/2 years ago. we make a special point on every birthday, anniversary, whatever, to get the other person a nice card, write a little something. 

maybe one day he'll be looking for something and find my stash, tucked away in my bookshelf: a stack of every card he's ever given me.

edit: i think it's very ""reddit"" that everyone's initial expectations went in such different directions - candy to fake money to guns to a variety of drugs to hentai. we truly do live in a society. thanks for all the love - i don't have writing up anywhere else currently, for anyone that asked, but i'm considering posting now, hah.",11
"my girlfriend washed my hair today. it felt so good. we don't normally shower together, but today we did, nothing sexual happened or anything but i just feel so on cloud nine right now.

when i reached for the shampoo she said ""wait,"" and  grabbed it herself and started running it through my hair, lathering it over my scalp and massaging my head. i swear it felt so good i just shut my eyes and felt like i was floating. then she took the soap and started sudsing me up, and used her body to spread it all over me, and rinsed me clean, using her hands to splash me and running her fingers through my hair and spending like a good five minutes just rinsing my hair and kissing my back and chest. it was almost surreal.

i just feel so incredibly loved right now, i almost got overwhelmed and started crying from being so happy while she was doing it. i've never had a girlfriend be so gentle and make me feel like this, i've always been with people who were very cold and i'm not used to this feeling. and i've got no one i can really express things like this to. which, when i think of it, is really pretty screwed up.

i love her so much.

&#x200b;

edit: wow, thank you for the gold and silver, kind strangers! i had no idea this would blow up, but i guess it speaks to a lot of people. i'll be sure to do my best to reciprocate the intimacy, and i wish you all the same feelings i got. 

take care of each other",11
"i did it ! i took off my hijab. &#x200b;

my parents are quite religious, they forced me both me and my sister to wear the hijab at age of 15. i never agreed to it, i cried hysterically telling them how much i dont want to wear it and yet they forced me to.  

in the past years i tried my best to convince myself to just accept it but it didn't work, it's just not who i am.

i always tell people to be comfortbale with themselves, to be themselves, and stand for what they believe in even if it's not the popular thing to do. and if i'm not practicing what i preach so as a person i'd be a liar.

so today at age of 24 i decided to take off my hijab behind my parents back, when i'm with friends, or in events i take it off and i must tell you that i feel happier and confident more than ever. 

my mom always raised us to do things for people, "" don't do this, don't do that, what people will say ? what people will think of you ? ""

so my decision was very out of my comfort zone, and i'm happy i did it.

maybe i started late but from now on i'm committing to work on my charisma and self esteem and not let anyone decide who i should be but me.",11
"a letter to my son. you came home this weekend, visiting from college. we'd texted asking what we could get at the store for you, and you'd replied chicken in a biscuit crackers and peaches. i bought a few more things because that's what moms do. there were yogurts in the fridge, along with milk. crispex, your favorite cereal. some fruit roll ups. i forgot to tell you about the chocolate pie.

&#x200b;

we had friends over for board games saturday. they hadn't met you yet. i happily told them about how you were doing in school, and your pride in your luxurious and lengthy locks. about how you'd told me your hair was softer than mine. i had made peanut butter fingers for dessert, and told them how i'd send the rest of them back to college with you. i thought you were out visiting your friends, but then you got up from a nap, and came in to say hi, and meet our friends for the first time. we smiled and introduced you. i'm glad they met you.

&#x200b;

you didn't stay for dinner. you were snowed in last weekend when you came down to visit, and had a lot of friends you wanted to hang out with this weekend. i said something, i don't remember. was it ""cya!"" or ""have fun!""? i almost told you to text if you'd be out late, but you're 18, so i was trying to treat you like a grown up. you took the car out.

&#x200b;

you struggled the first quarter, last quarter. you failed the first math midterm, since your high school teachers had left you woefully unprepared. your math teacher had a policy though, where you could get the grade in the class of either your midterms, or of your final. you decided to learn everything you should have in high school, then started relearning everything in the book from the start. you pulled off a great grade. i was so proud of you. you bragged about being a mother fucking prodigy in your cs class (you were too old to be a prodigy at 18, but i let that slide), but i was so much more proud of what you accomplished in math than of how you did in cs.

&#x200b;

you struggled with some other things too. things you opened up about. some addictions, anxiety, depression. after your friend killed himself last summer, you got your first tattoo. it was a semicolon with a heart at the top of it. mental health awareness. you got it huge- most semicolon tattoos are tiny little things, but yours was a good three inches or more. you took my advice and had it done by a professional, rather than your friend with the tattoo gun, even though you had to wait a few more weeks. you had it before you left for college.

&#x200b;

after your friend died, we made appointments with a counselor. you told me you liked her, and that she was helping. she hadn't been taking new clients, but made an exception for you. at first i drove you to the appointments, and waited in the room outside. then you started driving yourself to them. you started seeing someone else up at college, and they gave you the medicine you needed, and we had our first bipolar diagnosis. i warned you that it can take a while and multiple tries to find the right medication.

&#x200b;

i gave you advice a lot. and i worried a lot. i told you it was my prerogative as a mom to do both. you were planning on moving out from the dorms, and i had started searching for some dump crockpot recipes to help you feed yourself. we had always talked about having me give you cooking lessons, but hadn't yet found the time. you told me about the duplex you would rent, but never sent the link. my sister and i started filling it with imaginary furniture anyway. you'd need a bed, a dresser, a couch. maybe, we didn't know if it would be furnished. you knew i worried, and once you joked that i always expected the worst things to happen. about defensive driving because of other drivers on the road. about providing your own condoms instead of using ones girls provided.

&#x200b;

i didn't worry about guns. you had promised me you would tell me if you ever felt like ending it. you told me how mad you were your friend killed himself. how mad you were he acted like everything was fine, how he said he was grabbing his headphones from the car, but instead drove off.

&#x200b;

you won't read this note. it's monday. i saw you last on saturday, going to visit your friends. according to your best friend, you had a great time. you told her your usual goodbye ""te amo"" and left to come back home. she said you even drove parallel to each other before taking your usual turn off. but instead you went to the beach. i went there for the first time 2am sunday. you'd sent her a suicide note. she called the police and had her sister drive you to our house. you wouldn't answer your phone, but she had the find my friend with your location.

&#x200b;

i got to the beach, but we weren't allowed to leave the car. it was cold out, but that wasn't why i was shivering. your friend was crying, but your father and i were just holding hands. i knew it was bad when the officer asked for the back window to be rolled down. it was to talk to us first. i couldn't find the button, someone else rolled it down.

&#x200b;

i miss you. so so much. i have the leftover peanut butter fingers, and that chocolate pie i hadn't told you about. those are only two of the many things around the house telling me about how i'll never see you again. there will be more. i had ordered some stress reliever toys from ebay. i didn't know if they'd make it in time for your care package this month, or if it would be next quarter. i ran out of time first quarter and used a preassembled amazon snack pack for first quarter care package, and i wanted to do a better job this time. your best friend told me you had liked it.

&#x200b;

i didn't sleep yesterday. i took a benadryl last night, and woke up this morning feeling almost human. until i remembered. i've already started on the kleenex. there will be more family visiting today. they keep asking if they can do anything. there are no words i need, no tasks i need done. i don't know what to do. i can't take back any of my previous actions, my previous words. i can try and help your father know he was a good dad, the best. you won't get my future words. i never told you i was considering writing you a manual for how to live life. a little presumptuous i know, i never had it all figured out either. but, here's a letter. i love you. i tried to tell you every time i dropped you off, even in college. i love you kid.

&#x200b;

edit: i can't tell you how much it has meant to read these replies. thank you. thank you. i may reply to more, but here's what i really wanted to say right now.

"yesterday i had my physically abusive wife arrested. we have been together for 11 years, married for 9. things have always been a bit stormy beteeen us, but have been getting worse for about 6 months. she is very controlling and manipulative to the extent my wages had to be paid into her account, i had to do the housework to her specification, or else she would lash out at me with wooden spatulas. if i argued with her she lashed out. if i talked moderately (she called it ""shouting"") she would lash out. she would also deny me meals, wouldnt allow me to have my own door key, she told me i was worthless and nobody would want me. if i tried to defend myself from her attacks she said she would have me arrested and i would lose my job. yesterday was the last straw. after being hit once again, i called the police and had her arrested. i have moved out of the home, i'm in a bed and breakfast tonight. tomorrow i'm going to the council about getting accommodation.  my life is now restarting and this time i'm in the driving seat.",11
"i just found my boyfriend's suicide note. ""if you are reading this, i am no longer alive."" that was the first line on a note i found that my boyfriend wrote a few days ago. it felt like my heart instantly stopped beating, i couldn't move. when i finally allowed myself to continue i didn't understand what i was reading. 

my boyfriend. the one who constantly supports me in everything i do. the one who never fails to have a smile on his face. the one light of hope in my life. i had no idea he felt like his presence on this earth was meaningless. i had no idea that he felt absolutely worthless. 

he apologized to his family knowing all the pain it would bring. he thanked them for all their support but told them that there was nothing they could've done to prevent it. i put myself in their shoes and couldn't possibly imagine losing a child, a brother, a best friend. 

then it was my turn. ""my darling, the most painful goodbye."" i wanted so badly to just stop reading and tell myself this wasn't happening. the things he said about me.. how much i changed his life. the way he'd miss looking into my eyes, feeling my touch. he said he hopes he'd be able to look down on me, he wished i would find my true soulmate. someone to make me happier than he ever did. all of my emotions were piling up and i could barely breathe. how could he not understand that he is my soulmate? he is the reason i wake up in the morning, he's the reason for every smile i make, every moment of joy i feel. 

the good thing about all of this is that he's still here with me, alive. i'm not sure what would've been his breaking point and when it would've happened. if i had found that note after the fact, my life would be very different today. he woke up when he heard me crying and asked what was wrong. i asked what the note was and began crying hysterically. 

he held me and we cried together. i told him how much i needed him, how i couldn't continue to build my life without him by my side. i told him i'd do whatever is necessary to keep him here with me. 

the happiest of people can still feel so alone sometimes. even though this was absolutely heartbreaking, i'm glad i know what he's going through and how i can help him if he ever feels this way again.


edit: thank you everyone, so much for all of the kind words, support and love. i have read all the comments and there's just no way i can respond to each of them individually. thank you all for sharing your stories, my deepest condolences go out to all of you who have lost someone you love. i am eternally grateful my boyfriend is with me today. i told him how much support he was getting from everyone and he teared up. seriously, i can't thank you guys enough. your advice was amazing and i know how i can help him more than ever now! sending so much love to you all! ❤️",11
"my abused adopted dog let me to pet him after 2 years of being scared of me.. today- the day when i felt how satisfaction feels like. i can't explain how happy i am for my dog, after 2 years of tears, struggling with eating, sleeping and helping my little to socialize with other humans and dogs, today, we did it. until today, my dog never let me to pet him, he was just happy when i came home eventually, keeping the distance from me. i can't imagine what this dog been through and how can he feel about everything that happened. but after 2 years, he felt safe for the first time. he deserve the best, and humans were horrible to him. 
i am so proud of him.",11
"i found my wife's body in the closet yesterday. pretty self explanatory. i'd left for work at 9 the night before, got off early since it was my weekend, and went upstairs to find she'd hung herself from our closet door. she suffered from mental health issues most of her life and i guess i knew this might happen one day, but i didn't think it would be yesterday.

the police came and went. ""we're sorry for your loss."" 

some friends came and picked me up, i'll be staying in the guest room for a bit i guess. my family came to pick up my son, he'll be 3 in april. my sister in law is going to look after him so at least he'll have his cousins to play with him. i had to comfort her mother, who blames herself. i had to call my job to tell them i needed some time. i had to call estranged friends, having them disseminate to others i couldn't reach. got drunk. took an ambien. slept. went to the carwash with a friend. stayed there until 3am. watched space jam when i got back. talked to my dead wife in the rain. 

it's been a rollercoaster of tears and laughter and silence and i have so my questions that can wait.

 the weirdest thing is though, i'm feeling intensely aroused and i'm having trouble falling asleep. normally i masturbate to help myself drift off and believe me, i want to. but i don't think i can. looking at porn seems... disrespectful? and i can't close my eyes without seeing her so... here i am. wide awake. spilling my guts into the void.

yesterday was the worst day of my life, and i'm worried about masturbation. god help me.

edit: just wanted to say how grateful i am for everyone who reached out this morning. i want to say so much more, but everything i type looks wrong. my son and i will be okay. my wife is no more pain. i have the most wonderful group of people sitting in this room with me now. i'm not angry. not with my wife anyhow. i'm angry with her disease, but i couldn't have asked the girl i married to go on hurting anymore. 

if you or someone you know is suffering from mental health problems, let someone know. let someone try. fight like hell. kiss your wife when you leave for work.",11
"i use my unattractiveness to protect other girls. i'm not objectively ugly, just charmless and average enough to go by unnoticed most of the time. 

whenever i'm on the subway and i notice some guy agressively checking out a pretty girl or staring at them creeply, i shield her with my plain figure and block their vision. i'm taller than most girls, so i usually provide enough cover for them.

today, a guy changed seats just to keep checking out a girl's ass after she moved away from him. i stood between them and saw he trying to circle around to get a better vision, but guess what? i can move too, asshole. i even got out on the same station as her to make sure the guy couldn't take a single last look at her. 

sometimes i feel good about doing it, but mostly i feel enraged that women have to put up with this crap everyday.

edit: just to clarify, i'm a girl.
averagedit: thank you, kind strangers, for the gold and silver! i also want to assure you all i don't find myself ugly, i'm ok with being average looking. i have attractive qualities, they are just not in plain sight haha.",11
i pretend to be asleep so i can hear my girlfriend sing.. sometimes i just pretend to be asleep in bed and she lays down next to me and softly sings. i had to tell this to someone. she gets really embarrassed and doesn't like it when people hear her sing. so i pretend to fall asleep just to hear her.,11
"working 60 hours a week isn't a badge of honor. working nonstop isn't noble. society needs to stop this crap.. i'm so tired of this idea that we need to work stupid amounts of hours to ""make something"" of ourselves. i have a stupidly easy self employed job. i work maybe 10 hours a week and it's more than enough to support my lifestyle with lots of savings left over. everyone i know knows this, yet i'm constantly hounded with ""why don't you get a real job?"" or ""you should go back to school and get a degree in something!"".

no

no never. i would never want to work 40 hours. i never want to work 60. work is not some wonderful beautiful thing. unless you truly enjoy what you do, and lets face it, 90% of people don't, it's just shit. i've worked in tech. i've lived the wake up->work->sleep in the car to skip the commute tomorrow for an early morning lifestyle. it's terrible. there isn't a company out there i'd happily do that for. there isn't a company i'd happily work a 9-5 for.

even here on reddit. someone complains about mandatory overtime working 70 hours a week. the response? ""you should feel lucky to have a job!"" and ""can i take your spot?"" really? this is living? this isn't living.

if you can't find importance in your life without working 40+ hours a week, you need better hobbies. we should be working less as automation takes over. yet everyone has this mindset that work is life and pointless without it, so big corporations have free reign on fucking everyone over since ""you should be happy we hired you! now clean our boots and sleep in the closet tonight cause you have a doubleshift!""",11
"my father, filmmaker rob cohen, is a rapist and child molester. my name is valkyrie weather, born kyle cohen, the oldest child and trans daughter of film producer/director rob cohen (the fast and the furious, xxx, and the hurricane heist among many others). when i was very young, rob used my body for his own sexual gratification. my mother witnessed one of the assaults when i was between two and two and a half years old, and has since confirmed what she saw. this fact has cost me more than i could ever convey here. rob has also raped at least one other woman, in her sleep. i know this because he would occasionally tell the story as an anecdote.  presumably in an effort to turn me into the straight son that he wanted me to be, rob took me to see sex workers and establishments in thailand and the czech republic starting when i was as young as 13/14 years old. through therapy and support from loved ones, i no longer feel that i owe this man any loyalty. and thanks to the #metoo movement, i have found the will to speak out. while rob will in all likelihood escape criminal justice, i demand that my story be heard. i am not seeking financial restitution, nor do i have a career to promote. my greatest hope is that others who have been hurt by rob cohen feel that they are able to come forward as well.


edit: thank you for the silver and gold, it's truly humbling. however, instead of giving me more please send a donation to trans lifeline or the joyful heart foundation. thank you again. ",11

"i was raped and impregnated. i am tired of people speaking on my behalf.. i was invited to hang out with my friend and his middle aged coworker. after we picked up some liquor, we went back to my friend's house, smoked a blunt, and started drinking. everything was fine up until they both left the room. my friend comes back and tells me that his coworker was expressing his interest in me. i was shocked as my relationship was public knowledge, but decided to play nice because i didn't want to make the situation awkward, thinking nothing would come of it as my friend was present. his coworker came back upstairs, and shortly after, my friend fell asleep.

&#x200b;

the coworker then got close to me on the futon, trying to coax me into drinking the contents of the red solo cup in his hand. after trying to say no several times, i gave in. it didn't taste of too much alcohol. shortly afterwards, i felt sick and decided to lay down. i only had two double shot drinks, and whatever was in his cup. he proceeded to put a fruit snack in his mouth and told me that eating the fruit snack would make me feel better. i started getting dizzy. once again, i resisted, but after he put his face directly in front of mine, i obliged and tried to take the fruit snack from his mouth with my teeth as to not make contact. that's when he forced his lips on mine. i tried to get away, but realized i couldn't move my limbs. i was stuck. i tried to say no, but my slurred words had no effect. at that point, i knew what was going to happen and just tried to keep my eyes shut until it was over. he raped me. after he was done, he cuddled me as if he had done nothing wrong, stroking my hair and telling me he was going to take care of me. i passed out soon after.

&#x200b;

the next day my mother picked me up, and after she saw the choke marks on my neck, i broke down and told her i was raped. she tried to get me to go to the er for a rape kit, but i was scared about missing work and trying to forget what had just occured. i tried to adjust back to normal life, but shortly afterwards was put in an intensive outpatient program and diagnosed with ptsd.

&#x200b;

at the time i had an ovarian cyst that needed monitoring via ultrasound. i went to my ultrasound appointment, which was exactly one month after the assault had happened. as the ultrasound was happening, i noticed a small circle on the screen, but thought nothing of it, thinking it might have been a blood clot as my period was a tad bit late. the technician finishes, and goes and phones the doctor. i didn't hear the conversation, but he came down and spoke with me. he asked if i was sure i wasn't sexually active. i cried and told him no but that i had just been raped. he informed me that the circle on my ultrasound might be an embryo and that i needed to take a urine pregnancy test. i called my partner after i provided my sample and wept. he kept me calm and assured me no matter what he would be there for me. the doctor came back in with a heavy face and broke the news to me. i was pregnant. i sobbed for what felt like ages. my mother and i left, and she told me she would stick by whatever decision i made. i already knew what i was going to do.

&#x200b;

i called planned parenthood and scheduled for a medical termination of my pregnancy. they told me scheduling would take two weeks, as i had to attend an informational meeting first. those two weeks were the longest two weeks of my life.

&#x200b;

i was terrified to go outside, convinced people would know about the dirty secret i was carrying in my womb. i was convinced the embryo was a parasite planted by my rapist to drain the life from me. there was not a second i was not in emotional distress. every minute was torture, reliving what he did to me and feeling my body change in a response to what had been done. i had never experienced a level of body dysphoria like that. i couldn't look at myself in the mirror, or be nude for longer than 30 seconds at a time. i was rapidly switching between dissociation and flashbacks. the intensive outpatient program i was in refused to give me anything stronger for my anxiety, as it could damage the embryo, despite my begging and pleading and promising that i was absolutely certain i would terminate. it was a constant battle not to take my own life. i remember walking into planned parenthood, surrounded by people calling me a murderer. i told them i was raped, and they told me it was god's plan and that the abortion would be another trauma. i was livid, furious at these people for ignoring my state of distress in the name of their personal beliefs.

&#x200b;

i went through with the abortion. it was painful, and sad, but in no way a trauma. this was my freedom from my rapist. this was reclaiming my body. this was being free. i am sad about it because this was not my choice. i never had a choice in this. this was the doing of my rapist, and what i did was the only way to save my life and reclaim some sense of normalcy. if i had been forced to go through with the pregnancy, i would have killed myself. had it been a birth control failure, i would not have terminated, but that is my choice and my choice alone to continue my pregnancy. i can not make choices for other people, as pregnancy is different for every woman, and it is their choice to make.

&#x200b;

i am extremely angry, shocked and disappointed at what is going on in alabama. women like me, women that are hurting, terrified, unready will not be able to get the procedure they need to be well. i am scared for them. i am scared for all women. these laws will strip us of our bodily autonomy, turning us into incubators for our predators. how many women will take their lives? how many women will die of unsafe abortions? this is the very definition of archaic. i've heard people say ""abortion is a trauma itself"", ""pregnancy is a blessing from god"", and ""but what about the child?"". i do not need anyone to speak for me. i am valid, and i will be heard. my termination was not a trauma, it was the first step in healing the wounds my rapist planted in my being. i do not want other people's religions dictating what happens with my body. the embryo i terminated was just that, an embryo. it had no thoughts, no feelings. had i continued the pregnancy, i would have died. if i had survived, the pregnancy would have destroyed my body, permanently scarring me and producing a baby that would be despised, unloved, and thrown into a system that repeatedly time and time again fails children. how is that a quality life for either of us? i am sick and tired of people dictating what women should do with their own bodies. termination is a personal decision and is no one's business but the pregnant woman.

&#x200b;

if i had to relive that again, i would still make the same decision. my abortion saved my life.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all so much for your support, and for the reddit awards. i plan on responding to each and every one of your comments once i get off work. i love you all.

&#x200b;

edit 2: reddit wouldn't let me comment for an hour or so, so i've responded to what i can for tonight and i will continue responding to comments tomorrow. you are all in my thoughts, and i am so thankful for your support. my pms are open to all who need a shoulder to lean on, or even just a friendly conversation. making this post is probably one of the best things i've done for my healing, and i've learned a very valuable lesson. despite how loud ignorance can be, love and compassion will always be louder. carry that love with you and share it with others. goodnight, and i hope you all have a wonderful day.",11
"just got married and we got the worst news.. we got married 19 september 2019. 
we have been together for 3 years and are madly in love. she is the best thing that happend in my life.

we had a wonderfull day and we were happy and in love. almost everything went as planned.

then came the honeymoon. 

we went to the carribean and did a cruise and stayed on curaçao for a week. we visited so many places and did amazing things, but during the honeymoon, my wife kept getting bruises, that could not be explained. also a lot of headaches. we thought it was strange but nothing to worry about. 

then in the last days of the honeymoon, my wife had a blood spot in her eye and got a nosebleed that went on too long.

a doctor came and examined my wife. he could not find anything strange and told us to visit the doctor we we got back.

so 2 days later, we are back and visited the doctor. high blood pressure and he ordered blood tests.

we went in the morning to get the blood tests done and got a call from the hospital in the afternoon. 

we had to go to the hospital with haste.
after 2 hours of more tests we got the worst news.

my wife has acute leukemia.

to be precise acute promyelocytic leukemia. 
a form of leukemia that causes bleeding and clots at the same time. 

it turns this kind of leukemia is more deadly at the start  and we were very lucky. 

there is a silver lining. apl is treatable and has a high survival rate. my wife will be treated with vitamin a and arsenicum. no chemo is needed ... yeahh.

but despite the high survival rate and no chemo. there are still risks. so we have to discuss many things newly weds should not have to discuss.",11
"i was raped by a woman and it ruined my life. i expect this will get downvoted into oblivion but i want to share this, and for the last time. being open about my experience has caused me nothing but pain and loss.

i'm a father and recently divorced, dating again... or was. after a failed loveless marriage was clearly dead end, i took steps to lose weight and get healthy. my love life prior had been sparse and i dated what i could get, including a short empty marriage and a the aforementioned loveless one. i was not longer morbidly obese and for the first time seen as genuinely attractive by a lot of women.

a small piece of background detail, i was physically abused as a child viciously. yeah, i know a lot of people were. i was also molested by my mother, a very toxic and damaged person. this is also something i won't be sharing again either as most have attacked me over their need to never believe a mother could do such a thing. obviously, my ability to feel trust and comfortable around women was damaged. this becomes key later.

i dated a lot of women, even went to therapy again. i had a couple short term relationships, and had finally reached a point when i was truly able to open my heart, trust and love freely. i felt strong and secure. 

then i met her.

we had amazing chemistry from the start and kissing her was amazing on our second date. the third date was fun too, and we fooled around a little, but something felt off so not much more. we made plans to meet the next night.

i came over and we talked. i opened up about some of my past issues, hoping that being completely open would ease my own last lingering doubts. she became cold, and tore me apart, emotionally, emasculating and humiliating me until i was to the point of tears. i never felt so small and worthless in my life. 

she then climbed on top of me and raped me. i did not consent to it. i said no. she didn't care, i was a piece of meat to her. my body betrayed me and responded, but i was dying inside, repulsed and violated. afterwards, she was done with me, and i left. i vomited outside of her apartment, went home. i cried that whole night and didn't sleep until dawn.

i reached out to friends, but was thought to be lying, or a loser. a couple of female friends became furious with me as they had really been raped, but men can't be. obviously i was unstable as why hadn't i enjoyed it? one by one i watched most of my relationships crumble or be damaged. last night, my best friend and i parted ways. things haven't been the same since that happened to me, after all i was supposed to be the strong friend she replied on.

men aren't allowed to be raped or molested and talk about it. we are laughed at and derided. just stop being a wimp and get over it.

i'm writing this because i'm tired of having to explain myself anymore, having to validate that it really happened to me. i'm tired of the jokes, the loss of respect. i don't date anymore, as i see every woman as another possible predator. i'm also tired of trembling when i hug a new woman for the first time.

it's time to bury this all down deep, along with the heart i feel i can no longer share. i'm just damaged goods now.

edit: i really didn't expect anyone to read this. thank you for the very positive (mostly) responses and messages. thank you so much for the gold and silver.

i am in therapy and ""doing the work"". i'm just not going to share this with others. what my mother did was something neither wife could accept, and judging on some comments here and some ""lovely"" pms, many can't understand how what happened to to me was possible a few months back.

i looked into prosecution, but despite living in a liberal state, i live in a conservative town, and they would do nothing. she also has a friend on the force. getting ridiculed by the police isn't going to help me.

i do have an ex girlfriend that is there for me. she is literally the only woman that i can be touched by. she knows and is supportive. it helps on the rare occasions our schedules cooperate. we aren't compatible as partners, but being held sometimes by someone i do trust really helps.

i'm just going it one day at a time, putting on the fake smile and living as best as i can. i'm working to be able to trust again, but it will be a long time.

edit 2: i am overwhelmed. my whole life has been rejection and pain, to pull myself up and get knocked down again by this event i wrote about. thank for the platinum, golds and silvers. thank you for seeing me. thank you each and every one of you. i don't feel brave, just honest. over 5000 people see me, and hundreds have reached out.

thank you doesn't even cover it. the world feels a little less cold today.

final edit (2019-02-19): thank you for all the support. i wrote this post to just put it out there one last time, and then pretend it never happened and try to move on. i am pleased that it meant so much to so many people, and so many reached out. i'm going to do my best to heal from this and move on in a positive way. i never thought more that 7500 people would care, as i didn't think anyone would, or even see my post.

to answer a couple last questions in comments.

i did freeze, which is why i didn't throw her off. in the back of my head i still had the notion of not wanting to hurt a woman. obviously, i would have acted differently if i realized what was happening. i was raped. i don't really care if you believe it, but it happened.

also, to the ugly and hateful comments that have started appearing in my inbox. i couldn't care less about karma or attention. i didn't do this for that. i did that to cry out one last time and then remain silent. i didn't expect this response and it's given me a sense of validation i never expected. i'm sorry that a few of you want me to kill myself and delete this post. i'm sorry that a few of you call me insulting and degrading terms. i have given out all the reddit coins to people who posted elsewhere for people like me. i'm not letting you bring me down, nor am i deleting this post. i want what i went through to be known for the next guy that has the same thing happen, and all of the wonderful, supportive and even loving comments i received to be shared.

to prove i don't care about my karma, i'm deleting my account, to silence those ugly, cowardly voices that lurk in hateful private messages.

thank you again, to the vast majority of you. i will never forget how whole and seen you helped a broken man feel.",11
"i just went on a date with a guy who tried to rob me.. i can't possibly tell anyone i know about this story, so here it goes:

two years ago, i returned home from my father's funeral. as soon as i opened the door to my apartment, a guy holding a crowbar came out from my kitchen holding my tv. i live in the city, so robberies are common. 

the guy began shouting at me and he clumsily dropped my tv and began holding the crowbar like it was a baseball bat. i was so stunned at what was happening that i didn't move. 

the guy screamed at me to empty my pockets. from the stress of the last few days with my father passing away, i simply started crying. not out of fear at what was happening, but because this was literally the worst time of my life. the worst moment. the worst minute and second. 

while crying hysterically, i gave the guy my wallet. i just sat on my floor and hugged my knees and told him, through my tears, to ""take whatever you want."" he hesitated, looked down at me. he dropped my wallet and sat down beside me. immediately, he began to comfort me. he began to apologize. he put my tv back on the table and told me it wasn't damaged. he told me that he lost his job and that his mom needed medicine that he couldn't afford and that they were homeless. 

he told me all of this while i just wailed; i cried for my father, who was lost, i cried for my future, for it was uncertain, and i cried because my home had been intruded on in the most violent way. 

for a good 10 minutes i sat in the floor with a guy who had every intent to rob me, telling me that it would be okay and that he was sorry. he begged me not to call the police. i just started screaming at him to get out. 

he ran away so fast that he left the crowbar. i threw it after him as he ran down the street. 

two days later, i came home from work and he was sitting in front of my door. i was so terrified that i pulled out my phone, but he had this look on his face of--i'm not sure how to describe it--remorse, regret? he told me that he told his mom what he did, and his mom made me some soup. he handed me this tiny bowl wrapped in tin foil. again, i was stunned and overwhelmed and angry that i slapped the bowl out of his hands and it shattered on the floor. i told him to leave or i was calling the police. he left. i remember he looked upset. i left the soup and shattered bowl outside my door, almost as a warning for him to not come back. 

about three months after that, i got a note in my mail slot from the guy. he told me his mother had passed away and that he was no longer homeless and that he had a job. he wanted to repay me for breaking into my apartment. he wrote down his address and told me that i was welcome to break into his place if i wanted, but he didn't have much stuff. 

this all overwhelmed me. i threw away the letter, but i remembered his address. i remember walking by there one day, out of curiosity. it was a ratty apartment building across the city. he was walking up to his room and he saw me. he waved. i turned away and left. he ran after me, apologized again. told me that he never meant to do what he did. he showed me the program from his mother's funeral that he kept in his wallet. he wasn't lying, she was real. he was real. he was a real person. 

i don't know what it was, but i believed him. we slowly began to grow together as people? i can't describe it. 

after a year of maintaining communication and learning about who he was, he enrolled in a local community college and began taking courses to earn credits before applying to university. i helped him study for his history class a lot. he's great at math and science, though. 

i never invited him over to my apartment, however. no matter how much i got to know him, i was still afraid of him. and he knew that. he knew that i couldn't trust him. 

but tonight, we went out for coffee because he said he had an exam in his world civ class. when i got there, he said he forgot his book. we just talked for a bit, we laughed, and then he told me he wanted to cook for me. on a whim, i decided to invite him to my apartment. after picking up some things from the grocery store, he came over. i was so nervous that i was shaking. he noticed, he squeezed my hand, and then he made dinner. 

it was amazing. we talked, we laughed, we sat in the floor and watched a movie on the tv he tried to steal. we made jokes about it. 

and then he told me that he missed his mom. i gave him a hug. then he left. 

i don't know what i feel, but i do know that i can't give up on people anymore.

some people just have the shit end of life. maybe things have a way of working themselves out?  

and i miss my dad, too. 

**edit/update** i am...beside myself to log on this morning and see this at the top of this page. i have been a redditor for a few years, but never thought this would happen. also, to those of you who are messaging/commenting to confirm the validity of this--i guess it never occurred to me when i wrote this that it sounded so... ridiculous? it really does, i don't blame you for saying it's false, but it's real. he's real. i'm real. it all happened/is happening currently. thank you all who have messaged me and commented! and thank you to the two people that gave me gold--this is just insane to me. i'm so grateful, so very grateful.

**edit 2** sorry for neglecting this; today has been insane with work and hosting a friend's bridal shower. i want to clarify a few things about this, because i am getting a *lot* of messages about a lot of different things. 

* people are saying that i am being too ""trusting"" of him after what happened. you're right, i suppose. i mean, i live in the heart of one of the most dangerous cities. my friend was robbed just a few years ago and was actually physically injured as a result of it, so me ""trusting"" him did not constitute me giving him a hug after he broke in. it was much, much more than that. 

* my dad died of a brain aneurysm in march 2013. he passed away peacefully in his sleep. the thing about my dad, though, was that he was the most generous, most kindest man in this world. i know people like to say that about their parents, but it's true about my dad. when i was 4, i remember him giving these guys a ride from prison--they were released after serving their sentence, but had to walk to get to where they were going. my dad picked them up, had them hop in the back of his pick-up truck, and took them home. he put his life, and basically mine, at the hands of these people who could have hurt us. they didn't, thank god. my dad taught me to be selfless and understanding of the world, and of people, and i loved him for that. but when i lost him, it shattered me and turned me into an entirely different person. 

* after my dad died, i became severely depressed and angry. i was angry at everything. i had to take a leave from my job (i teach second grade). all day, i would lay in bed and think about how much i hated god--or whatever higher power--for taking my dad away. nothing seemed worth it. after the guy--my *friend*--broke into my apartment, i hated him for a while. i hated my dad for making me so trusting (because i didn't call the cops on the guy). i hated my dad for dying, i hated him for being so incredibly compassionate and better than me. i hated myself for being vulnerable. i just hated everything. 

* the guy who tried to rob me is a person. and of course, i constantly ask myself when i'm with him, ""what happens if he tries to hurt me? or rob me again?"" but the thing about him is that--he *knows* i'm thinking this, and he constantly tries to reassure me. we have grown together as people, as i said. there's a whole two years that i didn't post in this recounting because it would be like a novel-length post. do i ""like"" him? i don't think so. i don't think he ""likes"" me. i think we both understand, respect and honor the other for our mutual struggles. we're proud of each other, and we're both guilty of things. me for shutting out my friends, family and students and becoming an awful person after i lost my dad, and him for going to incredible lengths to try and save his mother from experiencing incredible agony in her final moments. 

* i intend to show him this post. i want him to know. he doesn't have a computer or internet, but i think he'll find this humorous. his story is not mine to tell; how his mother died is not my story to tell; what exactly drove him to pry open my front door with a crowbar is not for me to tell; what happened to his family is not for me to tell. but what is for me to tell is that he is a human; he is flawed; god, he's so flawed. but after knowing him, and learning about his life--about his childhood and the tiny little child who used to be so passionate about school and learning as he was, as he told me, i know that he has his story. i have my story. you have yours.  

* and although i think it is irrelevant, the thought of even dating after the last few years hasn't crossed my mind. was i involved in relationships prior to my dad's passing? yes. one was long-term and had a foreseeable end with an engagement, but things happen. life happens. 

i'm meeting with him tomorrow at his work, while he's on break, to give him some old study materials that i have from a literature class i took in college. it's all so normal, and i'm not afraid. my dad was never afraid, so i shouldn't have to be. i choose not to be. ",11
"just made an app that got me (21m poor college student) a job offer starting at 70k and nobody to tell about it. so i made an app for a friend that works for one of the usa's largest companys because their network team had a mess to clean up that would've taken well over 1000 hours. the company's vendors kept saying it was impossible and couldn't be done, so i said i'd give it a shot.

i made the app in about 8-10 hours, handed it over, and today they offered me that! right now i'm making $15, so this is huge.

the sad part is i wanna tell someone how excited i am, but my one friend already knows, and i don't have anyone else, but i'm so pumped you guys have no clue.

edit: thanks for the support everyone! i really appreciate it all! i wish i had the time to respond to all of you!

also - the app basically parsed 8 million lines of a file pulling info that they needed from arbitrary points in the file and organizing it into an easy, human readable format so that instead of searching through this file for info specific to subnets and certain ip's, they can type in the source and destination or subnet and copy and paste it to clear up their network traffic. they said even if it took a few minutes to pull the info they'd be ecstatic. it only takes 4 seconds. haha, they couldn't believe it.

basically their network was teetering on the edge of destruction and they needed a way to find how they could extract the information within 10 days so that they could fix it before this company lost millions of dollars a day. sorry for the vagueness, but we broke a lot of security protocols so i could build this. but the company didn't mind once they saw it worked. 😁",11
"my coworker died this morning and i'm actually pretty glad about it.. i'm the only person in my office under 50. when i first started everybody told me to watch out for this guy. he was pretty open about his constant drinking and smoking (cigarettes and marijuana) and had a very abrasive personality. for some reason though i liked him right away, and i think he liked me too, he told my supervisor he thought i was smart. 

he used to yell and just rage at everyone, call them names, call them stupid and every creative insult that you can think of. was not that good of a guy to almost everyone. but it was never directed at me, the bright eyed and bushy tailed woman right out of college. the one time he gave me guff was when i asked for his advice because there was a problem in his department, and when he started in on me i immediately said ""i don't have time for this shit,"" and left his office and went back to the situation i was handling. and it got handled. he never said a mean word to me again and i heard through the office grapevine later that he really respected me for that. 

well, all that drinking and smoking and stress of being an asshole caught up to him, i guess. he found out he had cancer and it got bad fast. he changed a lot- i think it hit him that his time was running out, but too late. i think he alienated just about everyone but me, i was one of the only people that spoke to him on friendly terms. i even brought him some of my favorite books to read during his chemo treatments. one day at work a few months ago he collapsed and never came back. and i got word from my supervisor in an email that he died this morning. 

one of the first times i was warned about him was when i was brand new and having lunch with another coworker at chili's, and we spotted him at the bar throwing back margaritas. she made it sound really scandalous but i didn't care. let the man have a nice lunch break, geez. i saw him there a few more times over the years on especially hard work days. 

so today on my lunch break i went to chili's, threw back a margarita and had a steak in his honor. 

i'm glad he's gone. he was a really unhappy man and you could tell he was in an unimaginable amount of pain at the end. if there's anything after this life, and i believe there is, i would like to think he's pain free and being an asshole to some rookie angel who isn't doing their job right. rest in peace, man.",11
"i'm still human so please treat me like one.. i'm a slow person not considered disabled, just slower. i learn slower, i do things at a slower pace. i'm just as frustrated as you are when i'm taking too long to count change to give to a cashier or trying to formulate a sentence to express what i need to. i still have eyes and ears. i can see the eye rolls and heavy sighs when you're too impatient for me to try to do what i need to. i hear those whispers and giggles you make at my misfortune, making fun at how dumb i look trying to read something off a menu. sometimes i go home crying because i know i'm not normal. i know i'm being made fun of. i'd give anything in the world to not be a burden on others, causing stupid issues that usually no one else does. please stop bullying me because i really am trying my best. i'm still human so please treat me like one.


edit: all i can say is wow everyone. i never expected this much attention. my phone was blowing up during easter and i was crying so much while reading the comments. i read every single one and heard every word each of you said. i'm very touched and blessed you took your time to read and respond. i wanted to touch on each topic people brought up and respond on my view on everything.

to those who said you love me, want to be my friend, hug me, any other way of showing that love, i love you too! thank you for, well, being you. :)

to those who did admit to doing some things and view this as an eye opener, thank you for correcting yourself. patience and understanding of people not in your situation can be a little tough, i get that. take away and use this eye opener in all different aspect of life and different situations. view through the other's eyes, you'll see wonderful things.

to those that would stand up for me, encourage me to take my time, even just give me a smile, it helps out. i start to know i have support, i don't have to rush anymore. support in any situation can make a huge difference!

to those saying it's probably just anxiety, i am going to somewhat agree with you. when the moment comes and you know you're going to struggle, it does cause anxiety. i'm usually not anxious till i have that feeling of dread. people's judgements and negative reactions cause more anxiety, ultimately making it worse.

to those who comment on my writing skills, commenting on i should write a book, thanks! haha!  maybe someday!

to those who are just like me, are in somewhat similar situations, ever felt that way, know someone like me, read the comments. it may not be directed at you, but it's about you/your loved one. it's about us. it's about our community, humanity. there are such wonderful people in this world, too. breathe it in. see the support, love and hope people bring. take this with you. love yourself because people love you too. :)",11
"my brother and i are adults and we still have our own ""secret christmas"" in his bedroom every christmas morning.. i just had to tell someone because this is so fucking cute and nobody cares.

my brother and i are several years apart.  growing up, we would wake up on christmas morning before our parents and eagerly lie awake in bed waiting for it to be ""okay"" for us to come downstairs for presents.  so at one point we remedied this by giving each other our presents for one another as soon as we woke up (usually at like 7 am) so we could enjoy christmas early.  we started doing this at like elementary school age.

i am thirty years old and super excited for my early christmas with my brother.  last time we did it, my husband stayed in bed while my brother and i exchanged gifts like little kids at 7 am.

i hope that we both live long lives and continue to do this when we're 80.  it's so cute and makes me cry just thinking about it because it's so adorable.  (also i have my period rn so everything makes me cry)",11
"my dad used to put a little sugar in my spaghetti. when i was little i had a huge sweet tooth, and i loved my dad's spaghetti because he put a little sugar in my tomato sauce so i'd like it better. last week my dad visited me and brought me spaghetti for dinner. i put it in my fridge and forgot about it for a few days until a couple of nights ago. i was extremely sad the other day, to the point of thinking about some very not so good things. i wanted something quick and easy to eat, so i warmed up my dad's spaghetti, and for the first time in years i tasted the sugar in the tomato sauce. i know it's stupid and it may seem really small, but i've really been struggling with major depressive disorder for years now, and knowing that my dad loves me and still tries so hard to make me happy brings tears to my eyes.

edit: thank you very much for all of your kind words! good dads are special people, and i hope this post helps everyone remember a good memory with someone they love. 

edit 2: i've also seen a lot of comments saying that putting sugar in spaghetti is common. i didn't know this, since my mom likes her spaghetti very savory and she's never done this. i've also never had sweet spaghetti at a restaurant or any other public place. i'd like to say that i am not trying to be special by saying that my dad did this, but rather that it meant a lot because he'd make a batch for him and my mom that was more savory, and then a batch for me that was sweet. it's very touching that he still does this years later because he remembered how much i like it. thank you to everyone for pointing this out :) everyone should have the joy of eating sweet spaghetti.",11
"after what he did i am going to marry this man even if i have to ask. 3 nights ago a human being changed my world forever. this is a little long but please read it's heartwarming. his name is shane and i can't believe i found him. we've been dating for about 4 months now and every day seems to be better then the last. from his sense of humor, to his amazing interests to his warm smile he's wonderful and quite sexy imo lol.but it wasn't until 3 nights ago that i realized how in love with him i am because of a single act of kindness. 

we were having date night and he's trying to suprise me with a salsa class. he heard me say on our first date i always found dancing amazing and wanted to be a ballet dancer when i was young but i never got the chance. now at 29 i figure salsa or something would be more fun. so he decided to sign us up and we would begin classes. on our walk we were about to get on the subway until it happened.

now another thing i love is shane listens so well and really gives a crap and after 4 months most guys would stop fully trying especially after some sexy time but not him. anyway i was talking and i kept noticing he was looking over at someone not listening. finally he said i'm sorry babe can u give me a second i need to check something.

he walks over to a young girl maybe 19-20 years old who was crying on a bench in the subway. i didn't hear him at first but i could see in his body language he was trying to calm her and help as 100 other people walked by and i would of done the same. as i approached i realized she was homeless for some time and all she had was a single bag. she said to him all i want to do is go home. he asked where she lived and it wasnt even in the city. she'd broken up with her bf who was gone and i am sure she was on drugs at some point but she also looked down on her luck. either way she was i need and looked scared.

so in this moment many would either hand some money over or wish her luck or maybe let her make a call. shane did much more. he pulls me aside looks me right in the eyes and says ""kelly i can't leave her here like this. i know it's weird but i've been really down before to and sometimes people just need someone to not only help but believe they're telling the truth. he said would u mind if postponed and help her?i said of course n so the journey began. 

we went to 2 women's shelters with her and to no avail they weren't taking anymore people. it was a bit cold and well we're not the richest people with our student loans so we really couldn't afford to pay for a hotel room in the city. so shane with his trusting heart of gold says would i mind spending the night at his place and asking her to stay with us. he figured she would feel comfortable with a girl asking her if she'd like to spend the night and we'd figure it out in the morning. 

i mean here i am with a guy i'm starting to fall for and he's willing to bring a stranger in for the night out of the cold. when i asked her she truly weeped and thanked me a million times but little did she know it wasn't my idea and honestly i'd of never of done this. but he has this gravity about him that just pulls you in. 

we get to shane's house and i have some clothes there so i gave her some stuff the would fit and let her get a shower. in the meantime shane ordered pizza and when she came out he made her feel so cozy like he'd known her for 100 years. we ate pizza, we played a board game, we laughed and then he made her hot tea and we watched his favorite movie the big lebowski lol. he made the couch up for her and we went to bed.

in the morning he made us all breakfast and then told us he'd be right back. he said he was getting us good coffee lol. he comes back and she was finally able to get a hold of her sister on someone's phone in her home town and she had a place to go. shane drives her to the bus station and buys her a ticket and hands her an envelope. here i found out, when asking where it was today, he'd gone down to the pawn shop and pawned his ipad to give her 120 bucks to get home 

this man gave his home, his time, his care, his money and his food to a complete stranger. he trusted her that she wanted to go home and just needed help. he changed how i view the world and in that moment i fell so deeply in love with him. i don't even know how to show him what this meant to me but i know i will become more like him. i love you shane with all my heart and one day i am gonna marry you, give you babies and grow old with you. knights in shining armor still exist and i am lucky enough to get to kiss one whenever i want.

"today my depressed mom finally took a shower and i spent 3 hours brushing the matt out of her hair.. title says it all really. it took so much not to cry while doing it but i'm so proud of her. i feel like we're closer now. 

just needed to get this off my chest. i love my mom.

edit: wow i didn't expect this to blow up at all. thank you all so much for the support for both myself and my mom. i've seen some comments that made me a little sad so to clear some things up:

1. i'm 25 so people can stop stressing that i'm 'too young' to deal with this. i'd have done the same thing at 12 though so 🤷‍♀️
2. i offered to sort her hair out - she did not ask and i did not feel forced too. i wanted to help her. 
3. she's had depression for most for many years and generally copes well, she's just having a really tough time right now with serious health issues and other things i'd rather not go into on the internet. she gets the help she needs. 
4. i have also suffered with depression in the past and she has been there for me every step of the way and has done similar things for me. 
5. i have a great support system so please stop worrying about me

the final thing i'd like to add is that my mom is not a burden. to those of you who have told me to get out or that she's toxic i'd like to say i'm happy for you. you must not have suffered with mental health issues or had someone close to you suffer with them. you're one of the lucky ones. i would never abandon my mom when she needs me regardless of any effect it might have on me. i hope you never have to suffer through you or a loved one going through depression but i do hope that you learn some empathy and kindness.",11
"we keep people alive way too long. it's inhumane. it's expensive. nobody talks about it.. i work in an ""old person"" home. 

there are many people here who haven't recognized their family members for over a decade. there are people here who scream and cry every day in confusion and misery.  there are people that are so depressed they won't talk.

and for this honor? people are paying tens of thousands of dollars a year. some even more. 

from a humanitarian perspective - this is insane.  unnaturally prolonging life  to squeeze as many miserable days out of the body as you can. 

christians who argue that these people must be kept alive to not interfere with god's will drive me insane. tell me what is ""natural"" about feeding someone through tubes and dosing them up with 50 pills a day? how is that more natural then, you know..... naturally letting someone die. my god, i don't understand religious people. 

faith teaches mercy and to not be cruel. how people can ""study"" for their entire lives and arrive at the conclusion that keeping someone alive in these circumstances is the right answer is beyond me.

from the financial perspective - i don't even see how this is an issue. this is a horrible, horrible, horrible waste of resources. the cost to keep one person, who doesn't even know where they are, alive for 1 year could house and feed a family of four for a year.

don't tell me there's no money for mental health services. there is. we're just spending it in the wrong place.

no one talks about this stuff. not democrats. not republicans. it's an uncomfortable conversation, but we need to have it.

but we won't. because:
- there's a lot of money to be made off these people
- it's uncomfortable
- it will lose votes

edit : *some ranting

edit 2: i'm not abdicating for ending one's life against their will. i'm saying that people should be able to pass when they think its time. and if someone is too far gone to even understand the question and they live each day in misery, then maybe it's time.",11
"gillette commercial ad. what the fuck.  so i've (21m) been hearing a lot of things about the ""controversial"" gillette ad these past few days.  i usually don't pay attention to this kind of thing but the video popped up while i was browsing youtube.  1.1 million dislikes over ~600 k likes.  now seeing this i thought to myself ""wow, how controversial can an ad get to have more dislikes than likes?"".  so naturally i watched the thing.

it's a video telling you to behave like a decent fucking human being.  why the fuck are people so mad about this?  if you're mad over this fucking ad, that tells me a lot about your shit personality.  if this ad personally offended you, i can tell what kind fucked up shit you probably did to your peers.  there is nothing controversial about this.  in the video there's a father stopping a child from getting bullied.  there's a man stopping his friend from cat-calling a woman.  there's a man de-escalating a situation.  

the only people that would find this controversial are the misogynistic neck beards that are going to have to ""find"" another razor company to tame their filthy facial fecal hairs due to all the bullshit they're sprouting.

so gillette, as a college male i still find your razors pretty over-priced, but i really hope you don't apologize for that ad, because i think it was great fucking message.

"i just got accepted to an university. just please, anyone, tell me you're proud of me.. my mother always told me to not get my hopes up. she told me to expect that i won't get accepted, she told me to plan for the worst. i applied to 10 schools, and this is the second year that i've applied to schools. last year, i got denied by 5 schools. the odds were against me. i had an 1.9 (transfer) gpa last year, a 2.1 this year but with much better grades + extracurriculars. i got into two above-average schools with 60-70% acceptance rates, and i guess i'll find out soon who else accepted me. 

my so and i are fighting right now over stupid bullshit and honestly he doesn't give a fuck right now. i'm crying out of happiness and drinking at 11:53 because i just got an email from another school tonight saying they accepted me. i'm important. i'm valid. everyone was fucking wrong. i can do this. i'm important. i'm moving out-of-state and i'm going to show everyone how fucking amazing i am since someone, or, more, a higher institution, gave me a fucking chance unlike the people who are supposed to fucking support me. fuck you to anyone who didn't think i could do this.

edit: holy fuck! the comments and the reddit platinum/gold! there's so much. i'm getting really choked up. i wasn't expecting this. jesus. thank you so so much. you all are the real mvp for just taking 2 seconds out of your day to tell some sad drinking internet stranger that she's valid. thank you. :( <3",11

&#x200b;

by the age of 13 i would start fainting. medical care was a luxury, i mustn't forget that.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 14 my abuser died. horrifically. i celebrated his death, felt elated. felt like a monster because i did…

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 15 we were officially homeless. dependant on the aid of the government and family, only to find both severely lacking.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 16 i fell in love, but i never learned how to talk. never learned how to say ´´i love you´´. as such many things would remain unspoken.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 17 someone fell in love with me, but i couldn't believe it when he told me he did.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 18 i would know the sting of betrayal, in part because i was incapable of warmth or intimacy. on the surface i looked indifferent, strong perhaps. on the inside i crumbled.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the time i was of legal age, i felt exhausted…

by the age of 19 i moved cities. to put more distance between me and my past.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 21 i picked up life. i was close to my first graduation. my professor committed fraud out of jealousy, and altered my final score. it was uncovered too late. i lost a prestigious job offer because of it.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 22 i would be sick daily. fainting often. i would be diagnosed wrongly.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 23 my first big project as a children's book illustrator remained unpaid. i lost financial stability. i was forced to switch jobs.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 24 me and the life i carried within would be in danger during labor. scar tissue prohibited a safe birth. i suffered severe physical trauma. the mental aspect once more, was left unspoken.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 25 i felt sick once more. the wrongly diagnosed illness had rendered my birth control useless. i was expecting twins.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 26 i would be bed-bound within the borders of the mic (maternal intensive care unit) due to early labor. they came early. critical condition. months of nicu, surgeries. followed by years of intensive therapy.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 27 they told me my children would be disabled for life.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 28 i would start slurring words. spots on my brain, minor neurological damage. cause possibly linked to trauma in early life.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 29 i would lose all my friends, and the only figure of stability during my childhood.

it hurt, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

only by the age of 30 was i diagnosed with c-ptsd. i started a therapy course.

i felt ashamed, but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

by the age of 31 i celebrated the holidays in a psychiatric hold. my kids thought mommy was on vacation without them.

i was ashamed. i was hurt. but i stayed strong.

&#x200b;

i came home after a few days. and i rebuilt myself. as i did, time and time again.

i never gave up.

&#x200b;

today, i am 32.

today, i felt stronger than ever.

&#x200b;

but then today, a doctor told me i would need a succession of life-altering surgeries soon, for yet another diagnosis…

&#x200b;

i broke once i entered the safety of my car.

i cried once my sunglasses could hide my tears.

i drove, even though it sometimes feels like i'm going nowhere.

&#x200b;

and then…

&#x200b;

then i started singing.

because i remembered that i used to love it.

and i cried. because i don't want to be strong today.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

**edit:** i would like to thank each and every one of you for the kind words and encouragement. i'm moved by the outpoor of love.

i had no expectations when i posted this. i've been a lurker for years, or chickened out on so many writings. i've only pressed sent once before. some people might not understand, but it takes courage actually going through with a post. i hadn't expected anyone to stop and read my lengthy outpoor. i wrote it because i needed to stay focused when my mind went astray. it kept me anchored.

so i'm happy to receive so much positive feedback. i'm enjoying the evening with my children. i will get back to you later.

thank you for the awards and support!

&#x200b;

**edit 2:** for those who have been trapped and grew up with abuse and chronic trauma: don't give up. healing isn't linear. there are no mythical cures. but there is help, and your starting point will be when you feel ready to discover the best version of yourself. and then keep working towards being exactly that, and be proud of your progress.

&#x200b;

**some resources:**

""the body keeps the score"" is the best book on trauma and cptsd (complex ptsd - a variant due to developmental trauma) along with ""the drama of the gifted child"". if you read nothing else, these too should give you all you need. in modalities, a trauma-informed therapist, emdr (r/emdr(https://www.reddit.com/r/emdr)) and neurofeedback (r/neurofeedback(https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofeedback)) are precious life-changing tools.

for those who called me an attention seeker: stop invalidating people in need. i'm at a point in my life where i'm strong enough that such remarks have zero effect on me. but others who are still battling to find courage to reach out might read this post. they might be in a crucial and vulnerable turning point in their lives. they might find courage to seek help, right up to a point where someone just has to invalidate them as such. those comments make them afraid to be invalidated again, to be called a liar again. they are afraid to be told to suck it up again. it silences victims seeking help because they fear to be just that: attention seekers, not people in real need. but they are people in need. people who suffered chronic trauma need help, compassion, empathy, acceptance. not ridicule, further invalidation or judgement.

&#x200b;

we've been denied help during crucial moments in the development of our lives. as children. it has severe and long lasting consequences, well into adulthood, both physical and mental. seeking out help now is a sign of healing and courage. but kicking people when they are down in a sign of weakness.",11
"my 17 year old brother still talks about (from time to time) about a compliment a girl in his class gave him. it's been 3 months.... 3 months ago i was laying in the bed that was once mine at my parents house when my brother barges in, sits down at the foot of my bed. i dont spend much time around my parents house, nor do i see him very often. but as soon as he walked in i was able to tell by the glow in his confidence and the smile on his face that he was extremely happy. 

my brother is a handsome boi, he has a good social life and has girlfriends in the past. 

so, naturally i asked him what was up, asked what he wanted? 

he smiled, and asked, ""what do you think about my smile?"" i shrugged and told him that i thought it was  fine. ""well"" he said, with a smirk, ""this cute girl in my class told me that she thought i had a very attractive smile!"" 
i didn't really understand why he was so excited..... (really i'm not trying to brag in this next sentence) i thought to myself ""big whoop, i get complimented fairly regularly.""

that got me thinking a little bit.

later that night i knocked on his bedroom door. ""charlie?"" i asked ""when was the last time you were complimented besides today and from a family member?""
there was a little bit of a hesitant pause, but then he admitted that he couldn't even remember the last time he was complimented by someone other than our mother or aunt! 
this got me thinking a little bit more, so i asked my male cousins, my male friends etc etc the same question. most of the responses i got were the same, ""i dont know"" or "" i cant remember"".

still today, every now and then, he talks about how that girl in his one of his classes complimented him on his smile, and it melts my heart how happy that has made him and how much it boosted his confidence.


since then, and after seeing how happy it has made my little brother, i've made it my mission to compliment at least 4 guys a day. whether its on their shoes, their smile, their shirt, their haircut or eyes. 
yes, this has gotten me in some awkward situations where they think i'm hitting on them, but most of the time i see them taken back a little with a smile on their face.  

i think we, as women, take compliments for granted, as it happens to us on a daily basis!!
the message i want to send to people in this post is to just throw a compliment out there from time to time to a guy! it absolutely takes next to zero effort for you, but it may make a huge impact on their day, their week, or month! 


thank you for coming to my ted talk.",11

"my approach to life as it comes to an end.. *edit*

my aggressive cancer is bringing a much swifter end to my life that i was expecting.  last week i had 12 months, maybe more, this week i have 1 month, maybe two.  there is much to cram in, but there is also much to reflect on.  following is my approach to life, my life, a person who has always been positive and seeing the glass half full.  

&#x200b;

put down your phone and have a real conversation

look a friend in the eye and ask them how they *really* are

listen to the wind blowing through the trees above

and marvel at the beauty of a vibrant sunrise

do something that takes you outside of your comfort zone

to prove to you are better than you thought

celebrate your successes, no matter how big or how small

and carve your own path to define who you are

be spontaneous, be unpredictable and importantly, immature

don't be led by narcissist fools that feed on your soul

don't be a slave to their conforming expectations

don't overshare and become fixated with likes and follows

it's false adulation that erodes your own self worth

don't buy things just to impress others, they don't really care

reduce, reuse and repair when you can

be yourself and be proud of it no matter of your orientation

because you being you is the best that you can be


comment:. thank you all so much for you comments and messages.  they mean so much to me and my family and we take great joy reading the positive reaction to my post.  i'll try and read them all and respond but please forgive me if i don't write back.  i'm busy cramming lots of good times in.

"to everyone who saw me shopping today.. thank you for treating me like a normal woman. today was my very first day trying and buying women's clothes and when i first walked into the store i was so nervous and scared. some of you looked away, some of you hesitated to walk near me and some of you didn't notice or didn't care. but not a single one of you made a comment about this transgender woman shopping for clothes.

thank you for making what i thought would be a difficult day such a pleasant experience for me.  
it's ok if you gave me a look of confusion, you don't have to understand.  
i'm just happy none of you said anything about me withing earshot.

thank you for letting me be a woman today.

"my son called me ""mom"" today. my son is four and has autism. for the most part, he's nonverbal. in therapy for the last week or so they've been working on ""mom"" and ""dad""  with him, by showing him photographs of myself and my husband. 


this evening when i went to go pick him up, his therapist brought him out to the truck. she pointed to me and asked him ""who's that?"" he enthusiastically replied ""mom!"" it's the first time i've ever heard him say it. 


i beat myself up a lot of days and always wonder if i'm doing the right things for him. small victories like today make me feel a bit better.

"i tried making my girlfriend pancakes. my girlfriend had a really long week and was tired. i know she likes pancakes and chocolate so i wanted to surprise her with chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast in bed on her day off. i snuck out of bed early and i followed the directions on the box exactly, but i was worried the batter was going to be too thick with the chocolate chips so i added a bit more milk. then it was too runny so i had to add more flour, then it was way too thick. so i didnt want to water it down anymore and said fuck it, but then they werent cooking properly. i also tried to make a heart with the chocolate chips but between the thickness of the batter and geberal spatula fuckery they came out more like scrambled pan muffin egg cakes and there was no heart.

you guys, her face just lit up and she was so happy with my pancake mess. she kept putting her fork down to kiss me and the way she looked at me... like its weird to type but i really feel like im something, or like im somebody you know. it was that same feeling where, i guess i felt really proud of myself for doing something like that, i mean i was pretty shy cause they weren't nice pancakes but she said i made her happy....

i'm sorry for posting this here again. i just really dont have an outlet where i can talk about romantic stuff like this, people around me arent about that kind of thing but really, being with her and doing these nice gentle things...

i love her. it just feels good.

"he texts me at 8:36 every morning.. my boyfriend works a typical 8 to 5 job, monday thru friday. he's always the first to text good morning because i usually sleep in. i've noticed that everyday that he's at work, at exactly 8:36am, he texts me a sweet good morning message. the first two days that i noticed, i thought it was just coincidence, but then for the next week, it was the same thing at 8:36am. now i didn't want to just assume that he had an alarm specifically set for saying good morning to me, but secretly i really hoped. eventually, i looked over his shoulder as he was setting another alarm for a different time and i saw his top alarm was set for 8:35am monday thru friday and is was called ""tell my love, good morning."" 

i still haven't told him i know his cute secret and i'm not sure if i ever will. part of me wants to tell him that i know but another part of me doesn't want to. at least not anytime soon. maybe when we're old and boring and need something to talk about haha. i just wanted to tell someone because it's been something that's been on my mind for months and i just find it so adorable!

"i've made bad choices my entire life and now that i have everything together, i'm need to get this off my chest.. both of my parents died when i was young. i was taken in by my best friends family and was raised as their own. his dad was out of the picture and only returned once his mom passed away and from them on i was raised by his dad. 

his dad, thomas was not a bad man but he was stuck around a bad group of people. he was a criminal. he paid our rent by stealing cars, robbing people on the street and so on but by the time i was 14, his luck finally ran out and he was caught breaking into an old mans home and was sent to prison. 

my friend went to live with his grandparents who were unfortunately unable to take me so i had nowhere to go. after my parents died, i lost contact with my family so the only place i could think of was to thomas' criminal friends. to my surprise, they let me stay ask long as i payed rent. the next few years i went from dead end job, to dead end job when i finally had enough. the money just wasn't rolling in so by 18, i turned to crime with them. 

there were 6 of us living in the same house and i was the youngest. they taught me how to steal cars, break into houses and everything. so that's what i did. by 20 years old i've turned into a complete and utter degenerate. i started selling drugs on college campuses. they guys didn't care what i did as long as i had money coming in. 

the next few years were some of my worst. cops were constantly patrolling the streets so i had no way to make money. the guys eventually kicked me out which left me suicidal, they were my family, the practically raised me. 

i spent the next few days in a homeless shelter. i was reading the paper one day and a man had been murdered and robbed out where the guys lived. fearing the worst, i went back to check if any of them were okay and they were. minutes later the cops pulled up and arrested all of us. turns out, one of the guys was the murderer of that poor man o read about. 

i was put in a room and asked questions about the case and i told them nothing until i had a lawyer present. once i did, i told my lawyer everything about my life and those guys and a few days later, he came to me with an offer. if i confessed to everything, i would be put into witness protection and moved across country to start over. 

so i did. 

i was given a small apartment, a shitty car and a dead end job stocking shelves at a grocery store. 

after a few months, i met the woman who i would later call my wife. she knew what i was and didn't care. neither did her family. they actually liked me for whatever reason, i don't know. they paid for my trade school and turned my life around. after a few years of working, i went to her dad with a cheque to pay him back and i asked for his blessing to marry his daughter. 

we got married exactly a year later. 

i'm now 33 and have a beautiful daughter who will be 4 this november",11
"thank you to the customer who didn't answer their door for their food. i work for skip the dishes (food delivery like uber eats or doordash). if someone doesn't answer their door, we call. if they don't answer the call, we message support chat, and wait 7 mins while they try to contact them. if there is no answer after 7 minutes, we can keep the food and leave.

you ordered from subway. a foot long pulled pork sub, and a 6 inch pizza sub. 2 bags of chips, and 1 cookie.

because of you, my family ate today. i was so excited, i ended my shift and drove right home. my boyfriend got half of the foot long and a bag of chips, my son got the pizza sub and half of my half of the footlong, as well as the chips and cookie. i got the remaining quarter of the foot long.

i am the sole provider and we are not doing well. i always short myself to try to get them what they need. i had to spend most of the grocery budget on bills this month just to keep the water on and keep my job. i haven't seen my son so excited in a long time, as he was to get 2 treats with his yummy sandwich.

i always feel bad when someone doesn't get their food. fortunately, the customer gets credit so they can re-order the food again free of charge. i'm sure they were annoyed at me somehow, i normally get bad reviews when someone doesn't pick up their food, despite me doing everything i can, but i wish they knew what it did for me.

edit: for anyone who wants to make rude comments about not having kids if you can't afford them.
first of all, my son was convinced while i was being help captive by the man who kidnapped me. and yes he was charged. i was 16.

second, i'd like to borrow your device that shows you the future since you seem to think someone can tell that in a few years, their stability will be gone due to unforeseen circumstances.

lastly, i hope you are an advocate for abortion and birth control access, not just fake tough online.",11
"i just got promoted at work and i can't tell anyone in my family because they'll sneer at me. but i'm so proud of myself.. i grew up in severe poverty, with a side of domestic violence. i worked hard and now i have my masters and a good job. i'm 24 and i've only been at my job for 6.5 months. today, i found out that i'm being given an important position on my team, bypassing more senior coworkers, because i am efficient and very good at what i do.

my family kind of glorifies their poverty. they see themselves as tough survivors. they aren't proud of what i've achieved. in their eyes, i've betrayed my past. i'm forgetting where i come from.

but i haven't forgotten. i got out, but i'll never forget. and i'm so fucking proud of myself. i did it. i make good money and i enjoy what i do.

to add another layer of feelings, my ex dumped me about a week and a half ago. he told me that my family issues are too much. my childhood trauma has, of course, affected me as an adult. i'm dealing with it, but he didn't like that i'd talk about it. he didn't like how i chose to deal with it. so now i can't even tell him, my best friend, about my promotion.

but fuck it. i did it. i *finally* feel like i made it out. and my family didn't help me. i did it on my own.

idk if it's the weed talking right now but i'm just staring at my beautiful gf and all these thoughts just came rushing to me. i'm not sure if the male body is viewed in the same light but i doubt it. we just look like bricks. if you are a female give yourself a good look in the mirror and really admire the work of art that is your body, no matter what problems you have with it.

**updated on 8/1/19**

i think i'll use my cake day to update this post.   i can not say thank you enough to the reddit community!!  for years & years i lurked on reddit. i read almost every single day, but i didn't participate much.  i had an old account for several years before i started this new one (which was supposed to be a throwaway account to ask a tricky financial question but i like the name.) as much as i enjoyed reddit i did not understand the spirt of ""the community"" until this post.  i could feel you all when i could not feel much else.  it was eye-opening and amazing and i will forever be grateful to each one of you.

i had more than 200 comments and about as many private messages.  it feels like those messages literally gave me life in the very beginning. i was careful to only read a few dozen a day, trying hard to make the comfort last as long as i possibly could.  i don't have words to say how much comfort i have received from reddit after this post.  i genuinely hope you never understand the depth of my gratitude because that would require you to understand the depth of my misery.  reddit to me was truly miraculous.  and because of you, i was going good!!  like really good!  everyone kept saying it was shock but i knew it was all the love, prayers, support and good thoughts that had come from this post that was keeping me afloat.  i am still positive that is the fact of the matter!

i was rocking widowhood until around week five, then it hit me like a freight train out of control. i completely lost my everlovn' mind.  i stayed slightly insane and more than slightly drunk until my doctor prescribed me an antidepressant about 10 days ago.  im starting to feel sorta human again.  well, human may be an overstatement but i don't feel like i'm completely insane anymore (although subject to change without prior notification.)  


when i finally gave in and went to my doctor it was because i literally thought that i had developed early-onset dementia. for real.  i was so worried about it for two weeks straight.  i just kept thinking omg this can't be happening!  our three (adult) daughters just lost their father and now they're gonna lose their mother to a memory care award or an insane asylum.  as it turns out (fyi tuck this away for the future just in case you might need this information,) but apparently if you only sleep for 2 to 3 hours a night for several weeks straight, you start to lose your cognitive skills.  i had no idea.  i genuinely thought i had gone insane.  

but back to you guys, i'm positive that without this post i could not of gotten through his memorial service.  i tried to write the eulogy for two weeks! i bet i started 60 times!  then the very night before the service (6/29) at like 2am i remember what i had written here.  i took the post, reworded a thing or two and added a bit more and voilà i rocked the eulogy.   

i made it through the whole service without shedding a single tear.  since it was going to be the first time i've met some of our employees in person i did not want to embarrass him by having smudged & streaked makeup  (not that dead people necessarily get embarrassed but you get the jest of what i'm saying.)  i think i would have made him proud. 


i can't believe i'm still standing to be honest.  but i've actually managed to work two whole days in a row!  like full days!  although our company has continued to pay my salary, i've honestly been too out of it to do much. luckily our two partners seem to be understanding.  

i am soooo looking forward to the day we are not every single thing reminds me of him!  tonight a quick trip to walgreens had me near tears because i saw candy corn on the shelf, it was the only candy he would ever eat and only around halloween.!  🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

anyway, i just want to say thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart!!  you'll never know how truly grateful i am! 

*also for those wondering, since i did not know for certain when i first posted the coroner's report came in a week or so after his passing:  sudden cardiac event)* 

6/14/19  original post below

                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


my husband died a few hours ago.  

around 5 p.m. on june 14th he went into the bathroom, locked the door and then collapsed.  i heard him fall.  i tried for a few seconds to get the door open but i couldn't.  i called 911 and they got here pretty quickly.   one of the paramedics kick the door in but it was too late.

we both have had some type of bug and had not been feeling well for the last few days.  he had taken some cold medicine so i'm assuming he had a heart attack.  i just don't know for sure.  he was only 57.

it seems strange that his passing would not be a big deal worldwide, like how is cnn talking about politics and not jeff?  the world has lost a truly great man.   a very rare man.  can't you all feel it?  the whole wide world is darker.  jeff was a good, kind, honorable man.  honest to god, he was the smartest man i've ever met.  he was was so sweet and tender-hearted. he loved me like no man has ever loved a women.  he was faithful and funny!! oh my goodness no one could make me laugh like he did.  he was the most quick-witted person ever.  he was a wonderful father, friend, cat daddy...even though he said he hated cats and was super mad every time i added one to the family, only to have him being the head snuggler in a few days.  i went through his phone and he had more pictures of our kitties than he did of even our grand babies. 

several years ago, him and his best friend started a company.  this left him interacting with the often ""chronically"" unemployed as well as heads of government. i always marveled he showed absolutely no difference in his interactions.  the homeless man applying for work was treated exactly the same as the mayor.  no airs, no pretension.  the moment he shook your hand, you were counted as a friend.  just honest simple kindness. 

he had a comfortable friendliness about him that instantly put people at ease. her also had an unexplainable air of authority about him.  people naturally just fell in line behind him.  he was a born leader.  people did what he told them to do, usually without question.  one story that always comes to m mind when i think about his seemingly otherworldly authority that left others comfortable and confident knowing he was in charge and he would handle it.  

recently we had a story in our local news about a child who lost a leg in an accident.   jeff donated the money to provide a prosthetic, on the one condition; you can't tell anyone where the money came from.  we are far from being wealthy.  in fact as little as 5 years ago we were nearly completely bankrupt after he endured a very long medical illness.  every single cent we had was gone.  all of our savings and retirement.  
during his illness his company took the first opportunity to let him go. he was sick and there we were without a dime or insurance.  
  
he got better then set out to open his own company so that he could make sure this particular job and community need was met.  he wanted to provide  the service with integrity.  he did.  by the second year in business he made more money than in the five years combined.  he was a work horse! he gave 200% to every single project and worked sometimes 18-19 hour days. he did it cheerfully because he knew he could help people.  he was such a blessing to everyone who met him. 

i'm a mess.  i'm so afraid and confused.  i don't know how to handle any of this.  he handled everything.  i had a rough childhood, early on it was if his mission in life was to make me happy. he spoiled me, not just with things but with himself.  in all of these years i can't think of a single moment in time that he did not put me first.  

i tried to always had to keep tabs on  him before i called him because i knew that if he was in a meeting or in the middle of a big presentation, it didn't matter if it was with the governor and mayor of the or any combination of bigwigs, if my number popped up on his caller id he would stop the meeting and take my call.   it was so sweet but it was also embarrassing to know you stopped and important presentation just to ask something as simple ""what would you like for dinner?"" i had asked him over and over again to just let my calls go to voice mail if he wasn't alone, even promising that if there ever was an actual emergency i would text him 911 first.  he still answered my call. it always made me feel not just loved but adored.

i called his closest friends to let them know.  i have literally heard more grown men openly weeping in the last day than i ever have in whole life combined.  i'm so afraid of a future without him.  he was my everything.  my whole life has been playing a supporting role to his ambitions.  i don't have any idea how to deal with the finances,  what to do about the brand new truck he bought six months ago.  i don't know what to do about anything and i'm so afraid i can't live without him. but mostly im afraid that i don't want to live without him.",11
"i fucking love people who encourage you to take your time when you're doing something difficult, new, or uncomfortable.. the phrase ""take your time"" is one of the most instantly reassuring and motivating things i've ever heard in my life. it's so simple, but so beautiful; it instantly removes any expectation that you're supposed to know what the fuck you're doing. and it tells you that the person watching you trusts you and sees your struggle for what it is: natural. 

so thank you, people who say that. the world is better with you in it.",11
"i'm finally okay with what i lost.. i had my daughter at sixteen. i'm now in college a year and a half later and a single dad.

losing freedom was the hardest part for me. i couldn't hang out with my friends, listen to shitty music, sleep a full night, study when i wanted. shit, i still can't take a shower without baby invading the tub. she sleeps in my bed every night. i have no personal space anymore. can't even take a bite without her trying to snatch it out of my mouth. class is so hard because she squirms and i can't concentrate, and then i'm too tired to review the notes i managed to make later. i wanted to be an author, i love writing so much, but i think that'll have to be postponed.

i felt like i lost myself and everything i used to be. her mom got to move away and start over, and she's never made an effort to talk to me again. it's just.. hard. i was so angry for a long long time. not at baby, but at myself and everyone else.

but today baby and i went on a picnic at the park. she kept messing up the blanket so i put it away and we sat in the cold grass instead. she liked the grass a lot. i fed her those nasty ass green grapes, which are her absolute favorite. the wind blew her curls around and glued them to her sticky cheeks. for a while i just watched her eat. she hummed at me every time i popped a new bite into her mouth, staring at me with those big brown eyes and that dumb four toothed grin. 

today i realized that i love this baby with every ounce of my fucking being and i'd rather have her. i'm okay with what i lost. i'll never get it back. i can never be as naive and young as i used to be again. i wish i could have had baby ten years from now, but she's here, and i love her more than i loved who i used to be.

she's passed out next to me right now. i'm listening to her breathe. i think that i've never loved anybody so much in my life. it hurts but it's special. something clicked today, and i'm really glad it did. it feels like a million pounds was lifted off my shoulders.",11
"had another interview today, after half a year of searching. this time they made their decision before i left the building. been doing interview after interview over the past 6 or so months. having been displaced from my home state for so long and being stuck surviving on the streets of sf, 2019 thus far has easily been the worst year of my life.

i went in for this interview, coming back to a company whose new york office i had worked at before i came here. i knew some of the questions, but there were some i just barely scraped by on due to how long it's been since i've been able to practice.

after the last question, the project manager and recruiter came back into the room, thanked me, then asked for me to wait in the hall, and that one of them would be out in a moment to take me back to the lobby.

i didn't expect them to make their decision as fast as they did, but they actually called me *back* into the office ""to be straight with me.""

>*""coffee, we admire your resume, as well as your previous work for our company...""*

by this point i already felt my heart pounding and smile drop. i'd already gotten dozens of emails that start with similar lines.

>*""and i personally am thankful for your previous service to our country""*

i smiled and nodded. even under normal circumstances, i always hate being thanked for my military service. i was an it guy, not a war hero.

> *""ordinarily we'd wait until later to come to a decision, however pm and i have enough information at this point to make our decision.""*

back to square one.

> *""and so, we would like to extend an offer for you to return to our company.""*

i think my heart stopped at that point when i processed what he said. by this point they were already going on and asking when i would be able to fill out my employment paperwork and officially start.

six months of homelessness, surviving off of the bare minimum i needed to survive. six months of incredibly unstable living conditions because the company i moved out here for no longer needed the role they hired me for. and now i'm going to finalize my employment next week, at 60k more than what i used to make, in a more senior position.

im gonna go watch avengers to celebrate, because i have been struggling to stay alive, and now i finally have enough peace of mind to think about how crazy the cliffhanger was in the last movie",11
"how relieved i am to hire someone who doesn't need to be trained.. the man just got out of prison after doing 10 years. shows up early for the interview, immediately starts working. don't have to show him anything, he knows our machines (street sweeper trucks) inside and out from past experience and knew exactly what we were the second he saw it. 

didn't say a word to me, until i finally told him he was hired. told me after that he'd been to several different local shops looking for work, was denied due to his stint in prison and was desperate for work. decided he would just show rather than tell. 

he's been working for me for the better part of a month now and is the most knowledgeable, respectable and easygoing guy i've ever met. doesn't complain and works his ass off. gets on with everyone in the shop. hope he sticks around for a while! we're working on getting him his cdl so he can go run jobs for us. 

need a few more good men like him to keep our fleet running strong!",11
"my fiance committed suicide and i can't bring myself to tell our loved ones how everything went down so i'm posting it here.. in may of 2018 my fiance committed suicide. we were together ten years and over the last month or so of his life i had noticed a change in his behavior. he had become more aggressive and hadn't been sleeping very well. i combined the two and figured he was just grumpy from not sleeping. his aggression wasn't physical, he would just pick fights and get extremely drunk like 6 nights a week.

my final straw was one night he came home 5 hours late from work in a complete blackout and screamed at our dog for no reason. he loved our dog and thought he could do no wrong and let him get away with everything so this was way out of the ordinary. the next day when he was sober i talked to him and basically just told him the drinking had to stop because it was affecting his personality, his health, and our relationship. we had a long and, i thought, productive talk. he agreed to stop drinking and he did for about a week.

the day he died he came home early from work, which i thought was strange, and he told me he was going to a coworkers birthday party and he'd be drinking. he didn't even pretend i was invited to come along knowing this particular coworker and i weren't the best of friends. i was irritated and kind of flew off the handle about him drinking again, he took the whole fight as me being pissed he was going out without me. which was not the case.

i told him i wasn't going to sit around and wait for him to come home hammered, that i was going to go out with my friends and i'd see him later, but i was still pissed. before he left he kissed my forehead and said ""i love you."" i replied ""uh huh."" i'll regret that for the rest of my life as it was the last time i saw him alive.

i texted him throughout the afternoon, apologizing for having an attitude and said i hoped he was having a good time and getting to relax with his friends. he never responded. finally at about 1130 i called him and didn't get answer. i called a few more times and finally he picked up. 

i asked him where he was, he said he was at home. i asked him why he hadn't responded to me all day, again annoyed, and all he said was ""i'm at home"". i told him i'd be home in an hour or two and he hung up. when i got off the phone it occurred to me he sounded sober, which i thought was strange considering he was at a party all day and he's never said no to offered booze in his life.

i texted him and asked him if he was going to be up for a bit. his response was ""why did you drink all my beer?"" which i didn't and i told him so. he responded ""nvm idc"". that was the last thing he ever said to me.

i came home about 2 hours later and he had hanged himself. i couldn't get all the way in the door because his body was blocking it. i was able to get my head in and the first thing i saw was our dog cowering in the corner at the end of the hallway. i turned my head to the right and saw his feet, and then his face. the image of the love of my life, hanged, will never leave me. ever. 

i shut the door and stood there for what felt like hours but probably wasn't more than 30 seconds. i called 911 and it seemed like before i could give all the information needed the police were there. a nice officer stood outside with me and gave me water. another officer came down as the medical examiner pulled up and asked me for my dogs name because he had to bring the dog down since he wouldn't let them near the body. 

even though i saw my fiance, and the officer said ""body"" and i saw the medical examiner my brain still thought he'd be ok. it wasn't until i was sitting on the bench outside our apartments, holding my dog, and saw the flash from the me's camera taking pictures of my fiance bouncing off the building across the street that it hit me. that's another image that will never leave me. i looked at the officer that was with me and asked if it was really happening. he nodded sadly and my whole existence exploded. my brain shattered into a billion pieces and i sobbed.

while the officer comforted me the me came out and explained to me that they were bringing his body out now. she recommended i take the dog on a walk around the block so i didn't have to see it.

i turned my back and walked about 5 feet before i heard the stretcher come out. i froze. i didn't turn around, i just stood there holding my dog. when i heard the van door close its like my brain instantly pulled as many pieces as it could back together. i turned around and the me asked me for a lot of information, which i gave cooly and calmly. i then asked her if i was supposed to notify his parents. she said someone from her office could do it but if i felt i could inform them it was always best coming from a loved one. 

i called a friend who came and picked me up. i sat on her couch in a daze for about 20 minutes. then i called my mom. at this point i think shock set in. i was very monotone. i told her what happened and she lost it. i told her calmly i had to let her go because i had to call his parents. it was about 430 am at this point so i had to call repeatedly to wake them up. obviously they were hysterical and i just kept apologizing over and over in a flat monotone voice. his mom asked me where i was and if i needed her to come get me. i told her i was with a friend and i didn't know what i needed right then. 

we hung up so she could call his sister and that's when i shattered again. i lost my entire mind in my friends kitchen.

i went home again to try to sleep but it was nothing but nightmares. for the next 4 months i slept little and ate less. my mind exploded, pulled itself back together, and exploded again over and over and over, intimately rearranging who i was as a person each time. 

9 months later and i've stabilized for the most part. i'm still in the apartment, which became a museum to him for months after his death, but i'm working on putting his stuff away and moving out and moving on with my life. it's not easy. today i found an old hat he had lost years ago wedged way down in his chair and sobbed for about an hour before angrily throwing it away. that's what made me decide to post here, with the hope that just getting it out there will heal me further.

i know leaving the home i shared with the love of my life for ten years will be a new trauma i have to endure, and i can't find hope or happiness right now but i still have curiosity about what's next for me and who i will become when the dust has settled in my heart and i get used to the hole he left.


edit: i wanted to edit this to address some of the comments from people talking about their own suicidal thoughts. i want it to be known i am not angry with him. i was, but i've come to realize that he didn't mean to hurt me or anyone else. he genuinely thought our lives would be better without him. he was incredibly wrong. his thought process and his inability to ask for the help he needed, through no fault of his own, leveled many people. for my part what breaks my heart the most is actually the good things that have happened since he left. those good things break me more than that one night because he isnt around to experience them with me. we spread his ashes where he used to camp with his family when he was little. the area is beautiful and he and i never went. he didn't get to see the look of awe on my face at the mountains and rivers we saw. he didn't get to hold my hand next to one of the most beautiful scenic spots imaginable. knowing that i will have beautiful moments in my life but cannot share them with him is heartbreaking on an indescribable scale. 

the people around you love you, and want you around. you make their lives better. the problem with addiction and depression is that they are twin liars who convince you of all the negative things you think about yourself. don't listen to them. there's always something new coming, always a new chance to thrive.

edit 2: u/spectralhues pointed something out and i want it to be visible as well. if you or someone you know is struggling with alcoholism do not attempt to quit cold turkey. the withdrawls can kill you. my fiance struggled with alcohol abuse throughout his life and our relationship. while i know for a fact he was able to go a day or two he could have, and probably did, lie to me about consuming alcohol when i was not around. if you feel you have this issue i encourage you to seek professional, supervised help. again, do not try to quit cold turkey.

"i'm turning 90 in october and i'm truly and earnestly terrified to die.. i'm not ready. i don't want to die. i feel like i'm the only person my age that wants to live. i have my health, my independence and am in great shape. all my elderly friends are all prepared to die. they say once you hit 90 it's anyday....anyday. i like seeing my great grand-kids, i like drinking, i like being retired and doing whatever i fucking want. i want to spend the next decade living life to the fullest. i've only just retired recently after working myself to death for 89 years. 

i think about it constant. every ache, ever pain i feel is this going to kill me? i fear everyday i'll die in a hospital in a vegetative state shitting my self or worse live as a senile old man. i want to die as a man should, free. but, most importantly i want to live long. i want to see my great great grandkids, i want to see the future. i love living in this day and age. i've always been tech savvy and theres so much going on it's truly exciting. 

nobody understands my desire to live. people just assume once you get old you're ready but, it's not true. death is final, death is scary. ",11
"thank you to the hotel maid who heard my cries through the wall. today i experienced one of the greatest acts of kindness from a complete stranger. the past 2 months have been quite difficult for me. i lost two dream job opportunities, almost lost one of my siblings, and have half lost the love of my life. i've managed to get over the first 2 items, but every day i can't help but to feel sad that someone that i love so much is so easily able to not love me as much in return. more so, i can't help lift the feeling that i clearly didn't mean that much to him. today was a tough day and i cried in my hotel for nearly half an hour before i heard a knock on the door. before i could ask her to come back, she spoke through the door asking if i was okay. when i opened, she said she could hear me from the other room and asked if i needed anything before offering to keep me company on her upcoming break. she left for 15 minutes, only to actually return

i cannot stress how much this act of kindness positively impacted my day. her english was quite broken, which oddly enough made me feel better. my mother herself only speaks spanish with a bit of broken english intermixed, and i've yet to tell her i'm gay. talking today with a stranger felt like i was able to have the conversations i'm not able to have with my own mother and it brought a lot of happiness out of me. we talked for nearly her entire break, and even shared some food. none of which she needed to do, but chose to do out of the kindness of her heart

i wholeheartedly hope that anyone reading this gains the encouragement needed to aide those in need, even if you don't know them. you have so much potential to change someone's day. don't let it go to waste.",11
"i'm 100% going to marry him one day. i was at my boyfriend's flat today, doing some work on my laptop. he had to pop out for an hour to meet a friend, and when he got back he took my breath away. he walked in wearing the same woolly jumper and heavy blue coat that he had on when he left but his cheeks were pinched red by the cold, his bright orange hair was messy from the wind, and he was holding his travel mug that no doubt had the dregs of a cappuccino in it. as soon as he saw me, he grinned.
he is the most beautiful man in the world in both body and soul, and i knew within a few months that i want to marry him. but today, it turned from a want to a need. i need to be his wife, to be the one to give him happiness, warmth, and safety. i would do anything to see that grin every time he comes home to a shared home one day - our home. in five or ten years, i'd like to see that grin on the face of a fire-haired child, perhaps. and, from the jokes and late-night conversations, i know he feels the same.",11
"my 4 year old son is autistic and i hate him. i hate being a parent. i hate everything about this.. i am so tired of having to ""deal"" with it all. the tantrums, the lack of comprehension, the aggression, and the inability of us being unable to do anything or go anywhere because of him. i. hate. my. son.

&#x200b;

i know a lot of people will hate me for this but i truly just want to get this off my chest without anyone who knows me knowing. i want to finally spill all the beans and get it out there and i'm hoping this will be cathartic for me. i already know i need personal mental help: alas no monies for that. people will also suggest getting him help as well: no money for that either, though he already is in a local state sponsored 2.5 hour daily program for kids with disabilities. it's helping, but it only goes so far.

&#x200b;

there are many things i despise in the world from politics to health care (or there lack of) to business practices to just people in general. i also love many things around here, so no ... i'm not a grumpy old man who just hates anyone and everything. there are even people i'd be oh so happy to see suffer a slow and painful death. but there is one thing i would never wish on even them: a child with autism.

&#x200b;

i'll start off by saying i truly don't know how single parents and happy/good parents with kids with disabilities do it. i truly do not understand how you have so much strength to get through the day and still be in one piece mentally. i wish i knew how.

&#x200b;

today all i wanted to do was something seemingly simple and it even started off well. go fuel up the car, then walk around the block a bit to get coffee. he had fun in the car, but as soon as the car right was over and we had to go left instead of going right the tantrums, screaming, scratching, pinching and all started. he wanted this instead of that: more tantrums. right instead of left the next time. and worse and worse. all i wanted was a damn cup of fresh coffee that i didn't have to brew myself.

&#x200b;

we (wife and i) work from home, and a decent amount of time we have to spend ""dealing"" with him. i use that word specifically as it's not the ""oh cool, that's a cool car you have! let's play a bit!"" .... not that kind of stuff. it's the ""for the thousandth time, do not stab the dog with the stick"", ""please play with the bouncing ball not against my head ... again"", ""we've talked about this a million times, do not touch the audio equipment"" and on and on and on. i'm getting tired of having to repeat the exact same very simple things over and over and over day in and day out.

&#x200b;

you might say, ""but dadwithautistickid, kids don't understand stuff you have to be nicer to them. they'll get it!"" ... i hear ya. but there is only so many times at this stage you can repeat the simplest of things without getting frustrated. be it how to put on shoes (just putting them on, not tying them), we need to go right instead of straight, this is how we go up stairs, please wait here for 5 seconds while i order coffee ....

&#x200b;

i'm tired. i should never have been a dad. this truly has been the worst decision of my life and i regret everything about it. save for a few minor points here and there, these four years have been horrible and only getting worse and it's largely because of him.

&#x200b;

logically speaking, it's not because of him it's just my perception and view of the world in which i cause myself to get angry on things that i should not such as his inability or ability to comprehend differently than us. logically, sure. emotionally .... emotionally this took a hour type up.

&#x200b;

i'm trying to get better. i'm trying not to get mad. i'm trying not to yell at him. i just can't help but be frustrated and yell at him sometimes. i know it's wrong, and there is no excuse for me acting the way i am. i feel like shit for yelling at him and dragging him home while he was wailing because he wanted to go 'that way' and i wanted to go home so i can go back to work. he doesn't understand the stressed of work, of time, of other people's desires/needs. i understand he doesn't comprehend most of what we're doing (both because of age and because of his autism).

&#x200b;

and it breaks my heart seeing all these normal kids his age doing normal things and he just don't ""get it"" and probably never will. i feel like a failure for having a kid like that. i feel like a failure for not being a better and good enough father, parent and man to be able to help him properly.

&#x200b;

i just don't.

&#x200b;

we're currently back home and to try to make it up to him he's gotten some hugs, some of his favorite juice and i turned on his favorite lego game. so whoever you people are at nintendo and lego who make your games accessible to kids: whoever you are thank you very much. without you i don't know what i'd do. the lego games are always fun, and we figured he'd like the lego city game ... and he adores it. it's the first real video game he's played and pretty much first thing other than just cars and trains he's truly ""played"" with. thank you. and yes for those wondering: he and i do play it together sometimes in the evenings or weekends.

&#x200b;

as for now, i'm going to go sit in a corner, drink my coffee and cry and think about how shitty of a dad i am. am i the worst father out there: no. that type of comparison doesn't help me. no matter what, i always end up comparing myself to parents with ""normal"" kids. my wife already knows what i think of him, though she doesn't know i ""hate"" him. she will never know. whatever i do i know i need to be better and do better.

&#x200b;

at least to round this off on a few positive notes: writing this out has helped clear my sinuses out a bit as well as being a good load off of my shoulders. the school program he is in has helped immensely since he has started as he's now able to put several words together into a mini sentence with some prompting and direction. he is getting surprisingly better rather quickly at video games, so i hope to find more he can play soon. he does like cars, so i'm going to try to find 'city' oriented ones ... though i hear the new yoshi game it nice. maybe he'll like it, dunno. i think they have a demo to try. my mother helps out sometimes which is amazing when she's able to. and when times are good, things are sometimes kinda fun with him around. i hope he can be both my gaming and hiking buddy in the future.

&#x200b;

thank you for reading.

&#x200b;

evening edit:

&#x200b;

thank you everyone for all your kind words and suggestions. i have never even considered contacting disability services for him, local community (such as church) groups and local fellow 'parents with kids who need help' groups.

&#x200b;

you'll be pleased to know i've given him extra hugs, kind words, snuggles, and playtime. we've both calmed down a lot. many of your heart felt messages truly made me tear up, thank you. tomorrow i'll be looking into local disability services and since it's a day off from school (good friday), i'll take some time off of work and walk around with him (weather permitting) or play a lot with him.

&#x200b;

i will be heading to bed now. thank you all very much. truly. everything you've all written has given me a lot to think about. thank you and good night.",11
"i saw my dead husband in a dream and i'm so happy right now. he died of suicide in 2002. he had become addicted to opioids after a work related accident that required 2 surgeries. during the last one, the surgeon accidentally severed an area near his spine which resulted in a near fatal infection. he was left with the grim prognosis that he'd never work again and he'd probably always have pain. he was prescribed pain killers and began abusing them when he had to double up to get relief. he doctor shopped and had 2 doctors prescribing him meds. after 5 years, they decided to wean him, but the damage was done. he started buying them off the street, stealing money from our bank account, stealing from the kids, pawning our things, nearly bankrupting us. he killed himself after i kicked him out of our home, telling him he couldn't come back unless he went to rehab. but this dream!! he was young and energetic. he was happy. he was laughing. he had no physical limitations. he was smiling and joyful. he was absolutely gorgeous. he was the man i had fallen in love with. i was young too, and we were back in our courtship days. he kept smiling at me and holding my hand. he came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me. he bent his head and kissed the side of my neck, the way he used to. in the dream, i was elated. in the dream, i kept thinking to myself, ""look at him! he's gorgeous!"" his face was right up next to mine and he was staring at me, and in the blink of an eye, he was gone. i jolted awake saying his name out loud. i looked around to make sure my present husband hadn't heard me, but luckily he was still at the gym. i spent the next 30 minutes sitting on the side of the couch hugging myself, rocking back and forth, with an idiotic grin on my face. i'm agnostic - i don't believe our souls go someplace (heaven) when we die. i believe we just end. but i have to admit, i kept thinking, ""i hope i'm wrong. i hope we do go someplace, and i hope he's in the place where i just saw him.""

if you've gotten this far, thank you for reading and letting me get this out. i rarely remember a dream for very long and i wanted to always remember this one, so i decided to write it down. i just can't get over the happiness it left in me - it felt like i actually saw him again after all these years - the way he was in the beginning, not in the end.

update: it's been a little over 12 hours since i posted this, and i want to say that i am absolutely blown away and overwhelmed by the response from you incredible people of reddit. all these comments and private messages and not a single negative one. think about that. this entire thread is a veritable lovefest! i wanted to respond to each of you individually, because i felt it was the least i could do after you took the time to write such nice things, and i especially wanted to respond to the comments that crushed my heart, but there were so many. let me just say that i thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your sincere well-wishes and your heartfelt outpouring of love! you guys rock and are the reason i love reddit! thank you to those who shared similar stories of visitation dreams. after reading them, i'm more inclined to believe that maybe there is a place we go to when we die, and maybe our loved ones can visit to let us know they're doing ok and are watching over us. what a feeling! what a comfort! so, to all of you - thank you so very much, i love you all, and keep dreaming!

i'm sorry that the picture is so shitty, but for now it was the best that i could manage. this is a veeeery sleepy bonnie!(https://preview.redd.it/g5c8lrrjd8s21.jpg?width=2592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b40ebe492efc1f42c118df382b49bc28b6c8221)",11
"i am dying, and am unsure how to tell my wife and family. i dont want to leave my children.. throwaway.

i started losing weight in december. this nicely coincided with me quitting any form of alcohol, and starting a diet. i was amazed by the results! i am 6'4 and in january i weighed in at 268lbs, and dropped down to 185lbs by july. 

i truly assumed that intermittent fasting was a miracle weight loss technique. 

during this time, i began developing new back pain. as the pain worsened, i made contact with my neurologist who assumed with was a bulging disc. he previously performed a laminectomy and discectomy on a herniated disc of mine. 

ct showed nothing, and i was sent for an mri. doc didnt like something he saw on the mri, so i was bounced over to another doctor. long story short - i was diagnosed with late stage pancreatic cancer. 

i have kept my wife in the dark about this. she assumes that it's just a bulging disc, and i've kept it on the down low. she definitely noticed the weight loss, but like me, attributed it to dieting. 

i need to tell her, and dont know how the fuck to start. i'm scared, and dont know how to do this. 

we have two boys. our oldest just started kindergarten, and his brother is a year younger and enjoying pre-k. i am the primary breadwinner, and my wife does not work. 

if you know anything about pancreatic cancer (i didnt, i do now)...the survival rates fucking suck. i'm an optimist, but also a realist. 

it is crushing me inside thinking of her and my boys alone. them growing up without me there. fuck. fuck. fuck. i'm sorry. its terrifying. it's horrible. i don't like it.

and the thing that really sucks? is that besides back pain and a lack of appetite, i feel absolutely fine. constipation is annoying, but doable. i dont feel like i'm sick. but the doctor assures me that i am, and that itll worsen in the coming weeks. 

i dont know why i'm posting here. i just wanted to tell someone. i know, i know...i should've told her before internet strangers. but fuck it. i need to practice. 

i love my wife and kids. i've been with her for 8 years, and she is the sunshine in my life. shes my best friend, and the person i most connect to in this world. shes my person. 

my sons are sweet, loving, kind, and my pride. i love those two tiny men more than they will ever know. i love seeing them grow. i love spending time with them, and being with them everyday. helping my youngest build lego's, and my oldest figure out a recipe on minecraft. theyee everything to me. 

i don't want to leave her. i dont want to leave my boys. 

i dont want to.

edit: good morning...thank you for all for the responses and advice! you've given me so much to think on. i promise i am reading every response, and i'll respond in kind when able. i have to go to work now, but i will be talking with her after work and will lay it all out on the table. i'll update as soon as possible.

edit #2: i told her and she took it as well as one can. being my wildflower, she told me ""if you fucking die, i'll kill you."" lol this is why i married her, and why i love her with my every being. were going to keep fighting this, and shes coming with me to appointment tomorrow to see options that doc can lay out. if interested, i'll provide updates on this thread or profile. for the sake of privacy, i will not use my main account. i showed my wife this post, and she told me in stupid for telling strangers before her, but she understands the misplaced logic behind it. if anything does happen, she has access to this account now and can update as needed. you all have given me so much support that its bringing tears to my eyes. i appreciate each and everyone of you. please know that i mean this from the bottom of my heart. the outpouring of love is amazing. were discussing how to explain this to our sons, but are still unsure how to approach it. my father passed from terminal colon cancer when i was 7, and it took me a long time to understand why it happened. this will be a challenge, but i'm doing everything i can to prepare life for those i love. i dont want to die, and i dont want to leave my family, so i will fight. i know several of you mentioned life insurance...dont worry there. i'm a young male and was perceived as healthy when i initially received life insurance through my employer. i have not told my employer, but they've been supportive of me since i was hired. i work as a therapist in the community, and will continue doing so until i am unable. again, thank you all for your support. 

and...

*please stop sending me these fucking holistic cures. its horseshit, and will not cure anything. me eating daffodils five times daily isn't solving anything.  if you choose to continue sending them, please know i will continue ignoring them. these ""cures"" are dangerous and delay treatment. think before sending this to people who are ill. for every person that ignores treatment to go the holistic route, please understand you are culpable. it is dangerous and stupid to send this shit to people.*",11
"""the worst part about a breakup is their pets don't know what happened to you."". i have never liked cats. i was very hesitant to move in with my boyfriend because he had a cat, charlie. i hated that asshole cat. he was a good boy with a good personality, but god he drove me crazy. he shed everywhere and all of my work clothes were covered in hair. he would dig around in my purse and pull everything out, or even open my dresser drawers and steal hair ties. a few times, he escaped and fell in the river and we had to rescue him. whatever you did, he was right in the way. he needed attention constantly. i hated him rubbing all over me and jumping in my lap at every second. at some point he decided i was his mommy and started sleeping with me. one night he had a seizure while sleeping and peed all over me. i was his favorite person even though i hated him. 

a few weeks ago i had to break up with my boyfriend after a year and a half. he's a great guy, but not the guy for me. he was understandably upset and yelled at me to pack up my shit and get out immediately. i threw everything into a suitcase and walked out the door. as i was leaving, charlie the asshole cat looked at me with the saddest, most confused eyes. i wanted to stop and hold him one last time, but my ex was yelling and i was doing all i could to keep from crying. i just looked at him and walked out. it's been 3 weeks and i'm not over it. 

my ex says he looks for me and sleeps where i used to sleep. i never got to say goodbye and my ex won't let me. i worry about him. i don't want him to be sad and i wish i could tell him why i left. they say that cats don't miss people, but i know by the way he looked at me that that isn't true. i feel incredibly sad over the stupid asshole cat i never liked, more sad than i am over losing his owner. i was right to leave that relationship, but i wish i could have said goodbye.",11
"i tipped a waiter. throwaway 

i just need to tell someone about this. i don't want to tell anyone in my personal life. 

back story 

i am a surgeon. i make one million dollars annually pre tax, after tax i make around 550k ( almost 46k a month ). i grew up poor, i'm a daughter of refugee/immigrant parents who came to canada for a better life for me. all my life i was taught that education was the number one thing. i love my job and i am living the most comfortable life. i am debt free, my parents were able to retire when i paid all their debt and now they are living comfortably just outside the city. 

now the story:

i always come to this family owned restaurant and over the years i have gotten to know the family very well. they are a family that escaped from north korea and came to canada for better life for their son. they have one son named jin. i've known jin since he was 15 years old because he worked at the restaurant to help out his family. jin is a very outgoing boy, when i come to the restaurant and no one was there we would talk about anything, he loved physics. i'd eat at that restaurant around 5 times a week and every time jin was there working. most times he would have his textbook and notebook there doing his homework when he had the chance. so fast forward 3 years. jin is in university, still at the restaurant working after his classes. we were talking one day and he said that he might drop out of university because he needs work full time and help out his parents, money was tight for them. this was very troubling for me because jin loved the stuff he was studying. 

then i decided that i needed to help jin out. 

i went to the restaurant a few days later when they were closing. his parents and him were cleaning up. i offered to pay his tuition for all 4 years of university. jin and his family at first didn't accept out of respect, i'm assuming. after a couple minutes of them refusing and me begging them to take it, the father started to cry, then the mother, then jin. i told them that the only contingency is that jin had to keep an average of 80% on his classes. 



fast forward to 3 months ago

jin graduated from university with honours. 4.0 gpa. i was there at his graduation and i couldn't have been prouder 


fast forward to last week

jin called me and said that he got accepted into university of toronto's medical school. 


edit: thank you all for the kind words. to answer some of your questions. i am in ontario. i don't make all of my 1 million/y salary from my job, i have investments too. i make about 700k from my job (i do a lot of overtime) and 300k from investments (pre tax). also to clear up the medical school acceptance, jin is going into ms1 this month. jin didn't tell me when he got accepted into medical school (december 2016), he told me now (september 2017) that he is going to medical school this month.

"im getting fucking married. yesterday was a normal tuesday. i got back from traveling. he was already home. we had sex since we haven't seen each other in a few days. it was so passionate and amazing. we got into pjs and made dinner together. steak, asparagus and salt potatoes. we played mario kart wii and he was kicking my ass as usual. he got up to get a drink but came back with a blue velvet box. i stared at it like it was something from another planet. he went down on one knee and i immediately started bawling my freaking eyes out. he asked me to marry him and i was somehow able to somehow say yes cry at the same tome. i held him so tight i didn't want to let go. he had no idea which finger to put it on he was shaking so much. 


i'm marrying the man of my dreams. ",11
"employee requested a payroll advance. i could not bring myself to do it.. his family is behind on rent. for the first time ever, they're looking at no christmas as well. he wanted to borrow half of his next paycheck to pay rent, late, this month.

this is a classic snowball. there's no way out. he'd be late in january, setting up the same situation moving forward, lather/rinse/repeat. his family shouldn't sign up for that. i'm not signing up for that.

i told him no. i told him why. i told him that i valued him as a person and an employee. then i paid his outstanding december rent, with a little left over for holiday gifts. i called it a christmas bonus.

i'm taking a chance on this guy. i'm investing in his well-being. i want him here for a few years at least. it was a risky, but pragmatic decision - and it also happened to feel like the right thing to do. i hope it's the right thing to do.

i don't know his family. he's a bright guy, six kids, a wife he's been with for 20 years. i have a good feeling about this.

let's be brave this year. let's choose risk, strength and investment. let's be kind to one another where we can and how it matters. maybe we can build a better reality.

edit: thanks y'all. this turned out to be really uplifting. i don't feel right talking about this kind of thing irl, so i came here to get it omc.

keep the love alive, folks. ",11
"parents should not act like providing necessities is doing the kids a favor.. my mom constantly shares posts about how kids are ungrateful, and how they need to be thankful that their parents pays the water/electric/mortgage etc. i no longer live at home but i have a young sister who does, and i feel so sad for her. providing necessities for your children is not doing them a favor, it is fulfilling a parental obligation to care for your child. i'm so tired of toxic parents who make their kids feel like a burden because ""i don't have to pay these bills. you can move out if you don't like it here."" using necessities to guilt trip your child who is too young to care for themselves is fucked up.",11

"they named their kid after me, and i feel different..  i just had a video call from one of my best friends showing off his two beautiful twins, one of which is named after...me!

soooo after spending at least the last two/three years suffering from horrendous depression, struggling with anxiety and doubting my self worth or point of existence, i managed to start crawling out of my hole this past year.
and i can not begin to describe how much this gesture was the cherry on top of the cake.

i feel like i've had an adrenaline shot of self worth!
knowing my friends thought highly enough of me means the world.

trust me, i know they might have just liked my name... aaaaand i know it might not be that big a deal but for me i'm taking it as a win and am gonna do my best to be the perfect role model for future mini me!

p.s. thank you for the gold! very kind 😁 i've been reading everyone's comments, sorry i can't reply to all but know they all mean a lot to me xx",11
"my husband passed away and i've never felt so relieved..  

six months ago, my husband passed away in a car accident. i remember his father calling me and telling me that i needed to get to the hospital as soon as possible; initially thinking it was regarding my grandmother, i got there asap. i was told when i arrived that he had been in a nasty accident and it was touch and go; many hours later i was told the 'bad' news, that he hadn't made it. i don't remember ever feeling more relieved in my entire life.

i do remember collapsing in floods of tears, but they weren't tears for losing him - they were tears for me realising that my demon had finally gone. tears for the fact that i would no longer have to go through the hell anymore. tears for the fact that there would be no more bruises. tears for the fact that there would be no more excuses. i finally felt free in that moment, that i wouldn't have to endure the physical, emotional and mental abuse anymore. i remember my own father trying to comfort me, just thinking this was a natural response to the circumstances, not realising that it wasn't. no one knew what i went through with him, no one knew that the 'holiday' we took just weeks before, was just me sat at home covered in bruises, with a broken arm, because of him. they didn't know that the substance abuse i was so deep in, was because i was trying to block it all out. they thought he was trying to help me. they thought he was trying to convince me there was more to life. in short, they thought he was a hero. in reality, he was anything but.

i remember sitting at his funeral and i couldn't cry, my face was just like stone. i couldn't conjure up any emotions about him being gone. as his family and friends spoke about how much of a good person he was and how much he loved me, i was just emotionless.

i feel heartless. i know that in a way, i'm in the right to have these feelings, but once upon a time, i loved this person and i married this person and we had good times, before the darkness settled over him. i sit at his families house for dinner many times a month and they talk about him, yet i can't get emotional or even sentimental over any memories, because they're overshadowed by the bad. i haven't told anyone. they think i'm getting 'better', because him dying has shook me up enough to stop me using. in reality, i reached out for help for my addiction, because i didn't need to block anything out anymore.

i don't miss him. i'm happy that he's gone. and that makes me, heartless.",11
"my wife is asexual and i want to debunk a few myths that annoy the crap out of me.. my (29m) wife (27f) is asexual, meaning that she has no interest in sex and does not experience sexual attraction. sometimes we get told things on the internet or irl that annoy the crap out of me. 

my wife and i have been together for seven years and married for four. we are extremely happy together and she is legit one of the most attractive women (especially after we both started working out... i mean she always was hot, but now.... dayum) that i have ever laid eyes on. she 'came out' a few months after we started having sex (i was her first), when over time, she realised she wasnt enjoying it as much as i was. 

the first myth i want to get off my chest is, she does not hate sex! that does not mean she desires sex, she doesnt, like at all. however she is not repulsed or hates it. what was different initially was that sex was awkward for a while. she would get very distracted, bored and felt uncomfortable (while consenting) throughout the entire thing. she has gotten better, and more used to it over time and to be honest (having had alloromantic (non-asexual) partners in the past) the best sex that i have ever experienced has been with her. she understands as a raging heterosexual male, i have desires and she willingly let's me have sex with her to meet those desires. that will be something i will always be thankful for.

asexuality isnt caused by '""not having good sex"" she just doesnt want it. she doesnt masturbate, watch porn or anything like that. she never had any interest in sex before she met me and she wouldn't care if she never thought about sex again.

finally asexuality doesnt mean she doesnt want kids. having kids is something that we both want and she always talks about wanting to be a mum. a few weeks ago we found out we are expecting our first. this has made us both really happy and she cannot wait to start a family with me.

i love my wife to death, and do not want anyone else. she everything to me, and i could not imagine being with someone else.",11
"my wife's grandma finally called me ""mijo"". alright so first of all i'm white as hell. like total cracker. 195% saltine american. my wife is so mexican that she can lob her chancla from the kitchen and hit me upside the head no matter where i am in the house. because of this, my wife's family has always been very suspicious of me and concerned for my wife for marrying a white boy. fair enough, i understand mexican culture pretty well enough to know how important family is to them and for a while i thought i was contaminating their family because of all the dirty looks they would give me for being so white. well, a few weeks ago my wife's grandma drove up from san antonio to dallas where we live and we spent the whole day together. it was a lot of fun besides the fact that they spoke spanish to each other most of the time and i couldn't understand any of it. when the day was over and it was time to go home, we were saying goodbyes when my grandma maria hugs me, kisses my cheek and says, ""thank you for taking care of my grand daughter. i love you mijo."" for those who don't know what mijo is in spanish, it technically means ""son"" but it's so much more than that. it's a term of pure endearment. to her, to my wife, and to me it was accepting me into the family with open arms. needless to say i cried that whole day. it was one of the greatest days of my life and i have never felt so accepted and loved than in that moment. 

edit: the support i'm receiving from this post has been overwhelming. i never would have expected to see so many people in the same position as my wife and me. thank you so much to all who support us!",11
"i had an abortion & i'm not ashamed.. this may offend people. i don't care.

planned parenthood has been there for me since i was 16 years old. ever since i decided to go on birth control for the first time and didn't feel confident in telling my parents. i was in love with my boyfriend and we were becoming sexually active. i also went on birth control because i had irregular periods and cramps that were beyond painful. i went to them for affordable contraceptive and a safe space to talk to other women about the changes my body was facing. especially since my dad was the one raising me and my mother was never around.

in 2007, i got pregnant. i was a freshman in college, on birth control and it happened. i was at the beginning of my adult life and i wasn't about to put my life on hold because of an accident. my boyfriend and i agreed it would be what was best for both of us. i had an abortion and i am not afraid to admit it. if you have a problem with that, then you are the problem. i did not murder anyone, i discarded a blob from my uterus before it had a heartbeat. i prevented an unwanted baby and for that, i am not sorry.

in 2018, i donated 36 of my eggs to a couple i don't know so they can try to have babies of their own.

i don't want children. i am not selfish. i am not a murder. i am 1 in 4 women who have had an abortion and i am not ashamed.



edit: thank you all for you're kind words &amp; support about this. some have not been super nice but that's ok. i have responded to you accordingly.

edit #2: thanks for the platinum kind stranger!!

edit 3: wow. i am beyond grateful to everyone who has responded to this! i can't believe how relieved i am that so many other women and men have shown their support to me and everyone one else who makes this decision. it's not an easy thing to admit considering so many different reactions to the abortion issue. there are so many responses i can't get to everyone but i appreciate the love. if you're have a difficult time or need to talk please pm me. love this community!

final edit: 
the bills being passed into law in some states have had me and so many others in a tailspin. access to safe abortions and the right to choose what is best for our bodies is vital, not just for women but for men as well. women will continue getting abortions whether it's legal or not, and whether you like it or not. luckily i live in a state that has protected these rights, but if i didn't, i would be doing whatever it took not to have my rights taken away from me. i hope women ( and men) will stand up and fight for the right to choose.",11
"i didn't kill myself today. i just wanted to let someone know without alarming people close to me. i prepared, even tested the branch of my favorite tree in my back yard to see if it would hold my weight. i had spent the morning crying and begging ""god"" the universe, anyone, to send me some sort of sign that i am seen and am an important part of this world. i got nothing. but then as i was standing on my deck looking at my tree, making myself comfortable with the idea of death, i realized i do not want to die i just want to live differently.  i'm ok, i will get some help today. just needed to put it out there that today .......i chose to live.

update!
i am still here! having no medical coverage has made getting the medications i know i need a bit difficult but i have found someone to talk to and that feels like a step in the right direction.  y'all touched my heart with your encouragement and excitement for me and my choice to live.  i will always remember the day i saved my own life and a multitude of strangers cheered me on.  much love to you all.",11

"dear professor, i see you.. last class, you let the students decide whether class would be held in person next session or not. i could see the hurt in your eyes when cheers erupted in the classroom and students started shouting ""no class!"" it's a university setting, and maybe you were hoping for a more mature response. you deflected the situation with sarcasm and awkwardly waited for the excited yelling to stop.

&#x200b;

you are a caring, kind, and passionate teacher. you give minimal homework because you understand there's more to life than busywork. we have to live to truly understand ourselves and our environment. the subject matter is fascinating and you're excellent at making complex topics palatable to all audiences. the lack of compassion and consideration in class that day wasn't a reflection on you, but the state of students now. those students were probably thinking about the lack of sleep they've had, the upcoming midterms, that overdue assignment they couldn't complete because they work evenings and weekends, and generally how much could be accomplished in the extra time they now had. they weren't thinking about your feelings, and how rude and hurtful it would feel to a teacher to have students cheering about class being essentially canceled (other than watching a video online).

&#x200b;

you've mentioned overhearing students discuss how boring the class is. you've brought it up in examples multiple times. i can tell it bothers you. dear professor, i see you. i appreciate you. every day you get up in front of the class and present to hundreds of students. you put in so much work for so little reward, banking on the legacy that you'll create in your students. you take the responsibility of opening minds and exposing them to a wider world of hardship, joy, differences, and similarities seriously, while approaching topics with empathy and sensitivity.

&#x200b;

dear professor... thank you. you are important. even if it's not the same circumstances, i know how you feel. it hurts when others are dismissive of your passion. it feels like a personal attack when you're vulnerable and share this fundamental part of who you are, only to be met with disinterest, boredom, and complaints. the effort you put in feels misplaced, maybe even wasted. doubts creep in about yourself, your passion, your career, your decisions, and more. please rest assured that someone is listening with eager ears and watching with understanding eyes. i see you.

&#x200b;

edit: thank you to everyone who has given input. i will definitely be sending these sentiments to my professor, probably through an anonymous letter (though i'm still deciding whether to include my name or not). i think a letter would be a good format for this rather than face to face, because a letter can be read and re-read over and over if desired, where as a conversation might fade over time. i also like the idea of giving feedback to the dean and department chair, too. special thanks to all the teachers who read this and/or comment. :)  


edit 2: i sent the letter through an anonymous email, that way it's in writing and the professor can print it off if they want. also, this allows the professor to reply if desired, and i can follow up at the end of the term with another email or by speaking to him in person. i'm going to send an email to the department chair too once i have some free time.",11
"i'm giving my son the best graduation present.. so some back story. i was in a rock band back in the early 2000's and we had some success. we toured with breaking benjamin, seether, three days grace and did a bunch of festivals. about 10 years ago my son found one of the bands old cd's and he loved it. he would always beg me to ""get the band back together"" but i would tell him it just could not happen. people moved on. then about 2 months ago we all met up one night just to visit. it was amazing everybody fell back into the way we used to be. so i decided to ask them if they were up for a reunion show and they are. so we are going to play a private show for my son. he has only seen old videos of me playing. he is going to love this. and he doesn't know about it. and i am going to bring him up and we are going to play a song together.",11
"my girlfriend's kids woke me up and surprised me today.. my girlfriend has two kids and i love them so much. they have so many issues with their biological dad because they are starting to realize how narcissistic, controlling and manipulative he is. so i try my hardest to be someone there for them because he won't. they tell me often how they love me and they even call me dad. 

tomorrow is father's day and in the custody agreement, they have to go back to their dads tomorrow. usually they'd go back on monday after school but since it's father's day, it changes. i'm sad that me and my girlfriend lose a day with them and they're sad they can't spend father's day with me like they wanted to. 

but today, as i was sleeping in, i was awakened by feet jumping on me and my girlfriend's bed. both kids were jumping on our bed like a trampoline trying to wake me up. i could see my girlfriend leaning on the door frame, watching with a smile on her face. both kids then started saying, ""wake up dad!"" a bunch of times. i grabbed both of them and we play wrestled. i was half asleep still so they got a major advantage on me but i didn't care. i love them. 

after our mini match, they both grabbed my hands and lead me to the living room. they had a table set up with breakfast that they made (my girlfriend helped them) for me and a cupcake that the youngest made at their dads house for me. there was also a piece of paper that read, ""happy father's day dad. we both love you very much. thank you for spending time with us, listening to us and showing us love from a dad."" 

i legit had to hold back tears from pouring out of my eyes. i rarely ever cry. my girlfriend and her kids mean the world to me and i'm extremely grateful they let me into their lives. 

my girlfriend then came and kissed my cheek and hugged me and said, ""i told you from the beginning that they'd love you because you're everything their real dad wasn't and never will be."" 

i'm in a state of aw and i'm really happy. i love her and those beautiful kids.",11
"the first in my family and i fucking did it. i fucking graduated!. molested when i was 10. dad died when i was 13. raped at 14. started drinking and doing drugs at 15. first in my family to graduate from high school at 17. dropped out of college at 19. got sober at 22. escaped and survived an emotionally abusive relationship at 25. graduating just 3 days before my 26th birthday.


i hope my list of heartbreaking hiccups helps at least one person believe in themselves because you can be the best version of yourself if you want to be. i'm trying hard not to cry, but this feels so good!

**edit: holy shucks! i know everyone says this, but i did not expect this to get remotely noticed. i will try my best to respond to all of you once my family goes home. thank you, thank you, thank you!**

**second edit: wowza! this exploded and i haven't had the chance to respond to everyone. thank you all so, so much for your kindness. it fills me with so much joy to know that this post actually made some of y'all smile. how nice is that? please take care and love yourselves and others.**",11
"first day in 5 years without a cigarette. i'm quitting smoking and yesterday was the first full day in 5 years i haven't had a cigarette! i can do this! 

update: 3 days down - still doing this! currently trying to decide how to treat myself for this little victory! 
update: incase anyone is still interested, 2 weeks!!! ive developed a shitty cough which i believe is my lungs recovery and expelling all the crap they've collected over the years. fun times!",11
"in two days i will start a job making $80k. growing up was not fun.  i didn't know what being a kid meant.  i did know how to differentiate between the different screams my mother would make as to whether or not it was a typical beating or her life was actually endanger.  

my parents were not well off, at 16 i witnessed my first eviction.  twelve police cars were parked outside and men came in with shotguns and side arms drawn.  i saw all of my favorite belongings get placed into a large rental truck and told that i'd be able to get them back, not to worry.  

from 16-18 i lived with my two parents in a single hotel room out of a suitcase.  dishes were done in the bathtub and there was no stove.  

from 18-19 i go to community college in the morning and work graveyard shift at mcdonald's.  i save enough money to buy my first car.  i painstakingly learn how to drive manual and scream when i can't understand it.  eventually i learn.  

after my first year of community college i transfer to a private university.  judging by the title you think you know how this is going to go but you'd be wrong.  

at 21 i am expelled from the private university for having too low of a gpa.  i am accepted back into the program, and have about $40k in debt racked up.   i have one chance to get it right.  

at 22 my father strangles me on christmas eve, places bruises upon my neck for weeks, then kicks me out of the house.  

at 23 my gf of six years kills herself.  the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that my co-signer will inherit all of my debt.  

at 24 i am one semester from graduating with no job in sight.  10 weeks before graduating i am seriously considering suicide as an option if i can't find a job after i graduate.  

at 25 i have graduated college with a bs in the most sought after field today and landed a job making $80k starting with plenty of room to grow.  it allows me to live anywhere.  

in two days i will start that job.  in two days my life begins.  

i fucking survived.  

edit 1: holy shit, this blew up.  thank you for the silver, and gold, and platinum.  they are my first.  thank you for all of the wonderful posts, thoughts and wishes!  i am trying to get to all or most of them.  

edit 2:  i knew there would be a second one.  thank you again for the currencies.  it's also really cool hearing how my story is encouraging all of you.  it's also neat to have this experience and feel a bit special.  when i woke up this morning i had over 150 notifications.  i may have even walked by you today, which is neat to think that someone browsing reddit might be reading my post, nudging their friend and telling them to read it, something i wrote.  that's just so cool.  

edit 3: the field...  i haven't seen anyone get it right but it's definitely grouped into some of the guesses i've seen in some programs.  remember degree seekers, school is an investment.  ",11
"i knew a kid in highschool that never spoke.. i knew a kid in highschool that never spoke. i was kinda a loner myself but it easy necessarily by choice. 
he sat alone at lunch , and i didn't have anyone to sit with so i just quietly ate with him every day. 

i soon noticed he was in a lot of my classes and i started just sitting with him. 
when he thought no one was looking he would smile at jokes or start to doodle , but as soon as he knew someone was watching he would go blank. 

naturally kids started picking on him a little, trying to get him to talk or asking him why he never spoke. none of it seemed to phase him and he would just shrug or smile. 

but what really got me mad was when the teachers would draw attention to him . when they would call roll they would pause at him sometimes and poke fun at how he wasn't going to answer. he would go really numb and still when this happened. 

one day i snapped at a teacher to ""leave him the fuck alone"" and ""if you feel the need to look cool in front of a bunch of high schoolers by making fun of a child than your a pathetic person""

i'll never forget the way he looked at me when i was sent to the office. he had his mouth open like he *wanted* to say something. 

at the office a councilor sat with me and explained that his father died in afghanistan and he hasn't spoken to anyone but his mom since. 

i learned a lot about people from him. i leaned how cruel they can be , i leaned how kind and compassionate they can be. but then thing i learned from him that was most valuable was the power of listening. 

i tried to take my life in november of that year, and i was gone for a few weeks. the entire school totally new because of my brother .  i was a stupid teenager who didn't realize the value of her own life.

when i got back he was waiting by my locker. 

he said hi. 

i thought it was someone else but he gave me a hug and said hi again. 

it was the most meaningful thing anyone had said to me during that time. 

i cried a little and after that he began to speak to me really quietly . it was little things at first like hello and good bye but soon he was asking how my day was and before i knew it he was rolling in laughter at my dumb jokes. 

he knew more about me than anyone because he listened.

after i graduated i moved , i still wonder about him almost every day. 

just wanted to share this with someone.

edit: a lot of people are saying i should find him on facebook and such. i have tried recently but he still doesn't have one, and he's not one for phone calls due to him not speaking much. its hard for him , and i didn't want to push contact like others did.
i get updates from friends in my hometown and they show him picture of me and tell him how i'm doing. 

he's currently living with his boyfriend who is a psychology major , i plan to try to reach out more and may be back in town for a visit. 

thanks for the kind words and encouragement :) 

edit 2: this has blown up more than i expected, i'll try to reply to all that i can ! thanks to you awesome redditors i am contacting his boyfriend and will hopefully soon write him a letter :) 

update: last night i contacted his boyfriend who was very happy to hear from me. apparently my quite friend had tried to find me in the past but didn't know how to spell my current last name since i got married. i got his address and i'm writing him a letter today :) i'll let you guys know what i put :) 



i also woke up this morning to so many kind words and amazing stories,( and my first gold!!!) i'll be sure to reply to all that i can . thank you so much!!!

"i love you. to whoever is reading this, i love you. you've got no fucking idea how much i love you, even if i don't know you i fucking love you. i'm drunk right now so don't judge but to whoever is reading this i really fucking love you and you really fucking matter.",11
"pedophilia is not a sexuality, it's a fucking crime.. i've personally never had an encounter with pedophilia, but seeing all these pedophiles trying to make another move for their *""sexuality""* to be legalized and hiding behind lgbtq+ as a talking point. pedophilia is **not** a sexuality. age is never just a number.

&#x200b;

~~pedophiles make me sick.~~ you are not, and should never be a part of lgbtq+, as people like you (that cannot control themselves and don't see a therapist about it, so than rape little kids) are **fucking criminals.** 

edit: i honestly didn't know that this would blow up as much as it did. i think that i should clarify and apologize for a few things i said. 

1. i misused the word pedophile. pedophiles aren't inherently bad, but what i was referring to were the kind that don't see help and go out and satisfy their sexual needs ( child molesters.)
i understand that contrast makes a lot of difference and i'm sorry for the mixup.

2.  after hearing out the replies, i now understand how clouded what i said was. i'm sorry to any pedophiles currently trying to get help that i may have offended.",11
"my relationship with my fiance will never be the same after this weekend.. my fiance 28m and i 27f have been dating for about 6 years- and engaged for one. a little over 2 years ago, he came out to me as a cross dresser. it wasn't the easiest thing to find out, but i assured him that i would love him regardless. 

this past weekend we attended a pride event in the city. this was his first opportunity to finally leave our apartment dressed up. he was beyond nervous, and so was i... but i tried my best to not let it show. people can be cruel, and i couldn't bare to see him hurt. 

saturday night finally comes. after 2+ hours getting ready and a few shots of tequila later- we make our way downstairs to the lyft. this was his (rather, her) first time being dressed in public. together, we walk into the party matching with black and gold outfits as our theme. 

we had the most amazing night. people were beyond friendly. he (she) was showered in compliments the entire night.  after the party ended- he (she) wanted to keep partying so we ended up at our local bar that we frequently go to. they were so happy to see him (her) as the true person under his masculine self. 

i wish i could personally thank everyone who made that night incredible. he was a different type of happy.  i'm honored that i was the one he decided to step out the house with and take a risk. cheers to all the lgbtq+ community. you guys rock.

update: thank you for everyone sharing their kind words with me! my fiance is a fellow redditor.. and i'll make sure to spread your love to him too.  

-on a serious note though- if there is anyone out there that is dating a cd, please feel free to reach out to me. it's quite difficult to handle when you have no one else to talk to about it... which is what led me to post this. it's hard not being able to sharing an amazing experience with your family and friends. i'd be more than happy to share some personal experiences and hardships that come along with something like this.",11
"to the family who sat behind us.... thank you. i'm a young, black, gay guy in alabama who walked into a waffle house with a much older white guy. you could tell from how much we were laughing and smiling at each other that we were into each other. so what did you do? you left us a note thanking us for being who we are and paid for our meal. you have no idea how much that small act of kindness meant to me, so much so that i've been crying happy, ugly tears ever since i got home. so from the bottom of my heart, thank you, for making me a little less afraid to be myself in this world.

edit: thank you everyone for continuing to blow up my phone with kindness. all of your words are going straight to my heart ❤️. and thank you strangers for the silvers!

edit 2: thank you for the gold! i'm trying really hard not to cry at work right now but y'all are making it really hard.

"i've finally made the decision to leave my husband who has been grooming me since i was 16. we started dating when i was 16 and he was 24. i put everything i had into our relationship because i felt like it was the only thing that could save me from my abusive household. 
i lost my virginity to him and soon after he would pressure me to have threesomes and foursomes with guys he would find on the internet while he video taped it. he would never say anything positive to me because he said i was young and arrogant. 

well when my religious parents found out about him they forced us to get married because he took my virginity. we got married when i was 21, i'm 26 now. 

i posted about our relationship in a different sub reddit about 2 weeks ago and i didn't realize how fucked up the situation was until then. 

i can't take this anymore. he won't touch me, call me attractive, or show any kind of affection unless i go along with his weird sex things. i'm tired of thinking i'm the fucked up one.


i have a college degree in economics and a subpar resume. im just going to be applying to different places all over the country so i can start over and maybe live a semi normal life. luckily i didn't sign a pre-nup so i won't be homeless after i leave him",11
"holy shit i just ordered food for the first time ever!!!. so, to explain why this is so important to me, you have to know about me. i'm 19 years old and have social anxiety, and i have it pretty bad. i also have autism, so i haven't really got much experience speaking to people and doing things most people would find easily socially🙈. 

however, just literally 15 minutes ago, me and my brother who's 16 were discussing how we're hungry, and considering our parents aren't home for another 2 hours, we wanted to eat something. so, we decided on getting ourselves a little kebab take away, and we decided i'd speak and i was absolutely shaking and everything. but it turned out great and it's literally just arrived i'm so happy!!! i phoned my mum and told her and text my girlfriend about it too, this is honestly massive for me!",11
"my boyfriend (25) thought i was asleep.... the other morning i was really sick. it was my time of the month and (due to pcos) i was in a lot of pain. i stayed home from work and spent the night using my boyfriend as a heating pad. he babied me all night and did whatever he could to take care of me. i ended up falling asleep in his lap. he moved me to my spot in the bed, which woke me up, but i was enjoying him doing this that i shamelessly faked being asleep.  he laid down behind me, wrapped his arm around me, kissed my forehead, and said, ""baby i love you so much. you mean the world to me. thank you for making me so happy. i hope you feel better. i love you."" i had to fight back tears. i didn't mention to him that i heard it because i'm afraid he'll stop doing it. i've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts my whole life but hearing this made me feel at peace for once.

edit: i know there's some of you that don't want to believe this because the title is ""clickbait"" and ""this has been posted before."" i understand that and i hate that people have become so numb to this stuff that they don't believe it can happen commonly. admittedly, i didn't even look through the sub before posting. i was swooning and caught up in my feels and wanted to share. i figured that with all the negativity going on in the world, along with all the mental health struggles i have endured myself, posting something happy and positive would be a good thing. obviously i can't force anyone to believe me but i wish people would try.

but for those that do, thank you for all the nice comments! i wish i could show him but i'm not ready to scare him away from doing this just yet ;)",11
"to the father who walked into my work with his three kids.. you ordered large fruit punches all around. the kids were so happy. you asked about our adobo pizza, said the kids were interested, i told you you wouldn't regret it. the little one asked for a mini adobo fried rice omelette. you said whatever she wants.

i asked if anyone wanted anything else. the big kid wanted the lechon sisig cheese fries. you said before anything else, what was my total at. i told you you about $34. you politely said no, that would be it. i noticed the two $20s you had crumpled in your hand. 

my father, raised me and my brother pretty much by himself and even though we struggled, he always made sure we ate. i lost him last year. now i don't know if these kids' mother was not in the picture, or just at work or something, but it was just so nice to see a father being good to his kids.

i wish i could have given you those lechon sisig cheese fries. but all i could do was keep those fruit punches coming to your kids, who were chugging them down enthusiastically, but being so polite. i wanted to just take those fruit punches off your tab; i would have paid for them myself (i wouldn't steal from work lol) but the owner was right there. i then wanted to give you big jumbo cups to go so your kids could take home all the fruit punch they wanted (something we offer to those who ask,) but i was rushed to cash you out.

all i could do was give you the best service i could, despite it being busy and other customers being demanding, and say, ""happy early father's day"" when i cashed you out. i hope that was enough to show you how much just you and your three angels' presence made my day. 

but the look in your eye when you said, ""thank you, i really appreciate it,"" told me that you sincerely did.

"i'm suspending my business because of what's happening in china. i design and produce stuff in china, then sell it for profit either locally, or on amazon. 



what's happening in china is disturbing, and it's just not hong kong. ughyr muslims are facing a genocide. i don't know what it is, i don't know why hong kong is getting much more coverage, however their mission is important, ughyrs have no one to call for them. 



so i suspended production, stopped it completely, paid what's due and stopped. 



i hope that the rest of people like me follow through. i understand that this will hurt us, but hong kong and ughyrs depend on us. apple, google, nba, blizzard, and countless other companies have bowed down to their chinese over lord's, it's time we show hong kong and the ughyrs that if these corporations are not with you, we are. we the people.",11
"for the past 5 years i've been living a different life and nobody knows long.  i grew up in nebraska, living with my dad because my mom took off when i was 2 and we never saw her again. my dad was extremely physically abusive and would spend all his money on drugs, which meant unless i could stay with a friend i most likely didn't eat that day. my dad didn't keep tabs on me, so as soon as i was old enough to work i was supplying my own food secretly, because if he knew i had money he'd take it. i bought an old car off a friend, fixed it up, saved up a couple grand and took off when i was 17. i didn't tell anyone. i didn't even really plan it. i just packed up my stuff one night and left. i worked odd jobs over the next few years, working long enough to make a paycheck and taking off again. my goal was california, and by the time i was 19 i had made it there. i changed my name, started going to college and after a few months got a decent job. i have a pretty nice apartment, friends who like me and even a girlfriend i've been seeing for a few months now. none of them know who i used to be. i tell everyone my parents are dead, and answer personal questions about my past and the scars my dad left on my body with vague responses. to my knowledge, nobody suspects a thing. every single thing i am i have made myself, and that's how i want people to know me. the stuff i went through with my father growing up deeply affected me, and still does. but i am done being scared of him and i am done letting him control me. 

edit: wow. just...damn. i'm floored. honestly i didn't post this with the intention of thousands of people reading it; to be honest, this secret has been eating at me lately. i wanted to make this post just to see what it would feel like to have it out there, so that maybe i would be more comfortable telling someone. and...just, holy shit. thank you so much for the kind words. upon reflection i believe that in part, distancing myself so much from my past gives me an excuse not to deal with it. i never had anyone supporting me when i was young, but i do now. i have friends that have done so much for me emotionally, and of course my girlfriend. i don't know if we're going to last but i'm serious about her, and i think everyone was right in saying that she deserves to know. i know everyone in my life will be supportive if i tell them, and i will. i'm not sure if i'm 'ready', but if i keep waiting i never will be. thank you again everyone for the kind words and encouragement. you've all done so much for my self esteem and confidence regarding my situation, and i can't thank you enough. thanks for reading, and sorry for the long edit.

"i met my brother that was ""missing""!. here's an update for you all: 

the day after i made my last post, i woke up and called into work. i told my wife (who is essentially my confidant and i tell her everything) the whole story. she wasn't really surprised; she's not a fan of my parents much. but like many of you, she told me to call the number i was given for my brother immediately. she insisted on it. she took herself and my son out for a day together so i could be alone to talk with him. 

i dialed the number about seven times before i actually pressed the ""call"" button. it started ringing and i hung up. then i got frustrated at myself and called the number back. it rang and rang and i got a voicemail, but it was the automated voice, not anyone else's. i didn't leave a voicemail. i thought the whole thing was ridiculous. i called my wife and told her to come home and she refused until i had talked to *someone* on the other end of the phone. 

about an hour of pacing and drinking two glasses of scotch at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, i called the number again. it rang three times. i panicked. i hung up. but this time, the number was calling me back. i swear to whatever god(s) above, i thought my heart was going to stop. i almost threw up right there. i answered the call. 

the first thing i heard on the other end of the line was a guy laughing in the background. there was wind on the phone. the person on the other end was outside and it was windy. ""who is this?""

it was his voice. i knew that voice. it was my fucking brother. my brother! who had been gone for my entire life! i covered my mouth with my shaking hands and just sat there. he kept asking me who it was. the guy in the background was trying to talk over him. he hung up on me. i called him back right away. he answered again. 

me being a creepy ass, the first thing i said after decades of not seeing him and thinking he was dead, i blurted: ""i got your number."" 

he asked me who i was and what i wanted. i said, ""it's me."" there was a really long pause. i thought the call had dropped. then i heard him tell someone to turn the radio down and roll the window up. the sound of wind stopped… and then he asked me my name. i told him and he said that i was lying. i told him i got his number from the missing children's network and detectives. i heard him gasp. he asked me what color shoelaces he wore to a picnic when we were kids, and i remember my mom getting mad at his orange laces with blue shoes. it was the last time we were together as a family. 

i could tell he was crying. the first thing he asked me was: ""where are you?"" and i told him i lived a few hours away from home. without hesitating, he told me, ""i'm coming."" 

he went straight to the airport without any luggage, bought a plane ticket, and flew straight to me. we stayed on the phone with each other the whole time. when he was walking through the gate, i knew who he was right away. he is middle-aged; salt and pepper hair, muscular. he looks just like our dad, only better. i know if i told him that, that would make him mad. 

i literally pushed an old lady out of the way and i just hugged him. he's about two inches taller than me. he was able to pick me up. he was crying, i was crying. i was having a breakdown. we went to a bar at the airport. he wouldn't let me out of his sight. he kept holding onto my arm. he kept telling me how unreal it all was. he apologized to me. he kept crying, telling me he felt horrible. i told him to forget everything and tell me about his life.

he's married. his husband is a doctor—a pediatric oncologist. they live in the pacific northwest. they have two children—girls, 12 and 8. he works as a legal consultant and has his own firm. he has an amazing life. he told me that he thought i hated him and wanted nothing to do with him. we sat at the bar for hours. literal hours. i think we sat for about six hours before i begged him to come home and meet my wife. 

we got home, and my wife was a mess. she hugged him and insisted he stay with us. at this point, his husband was going insane and kept calling him. he had no idea what was going on. he thought he had eloped or something. it was crazy for a couple of days until everything was explained and out in the open. 

my son and my brother were like two peas in a pod. honestly, i never wanted children. my son was an amazing accident, but i'm not good with kids. i'm always afraid i'm going to break them. but my brother is a pro. kids love him. 

he stayed with us for two weeks. and in two weeks, everything about my life changed. his husband and two daughters flew in to stay with us. my brother-in-law and my two nieces. my family. they were my family. they are my family. 

my brother wants my wife and i to move to be closer to him. my wife is on board. i work as a professor at a university and have already started to send out feelers to see if there are any open positions, and i've found one that is actually tenured and higher pay. 

i do not plan on forgiving my parents, but my brother still loves them. he went by their house and knocked on the door. my father shut the door in his face. my mother gave him a hug and told him to take care of himself. then she shut him out. i can't forgive them for that. i have no reason to stay close to them. i want to be with my family. i want to make up for all the lost time. 

it's 2am right now and i'm drinking a tall glass of scotch and grading papers. my beautiful, wonderful, smart, amazing wife is asleep on the couch. she likes to watch me grade papers. my son is asleep in his room cuddled up with all the stuffed animals his uncle brought him. and i'm here, so happy, so fulfilled knowing that my family has grown and doubled in size so suddenly. my heart is happy. i am so happy right now, reddit. i am so happy.

when i spoke to some friends today about not wanting to go in for my 8 hour shift tomorrow, all i got told was ""it's an 8 hour shift, that's a normal length shift.""

fuck you. i know it is. this will be my 6th day in a row. that's around 35 hours in that amount of time. i have some chronic pain in my shoulder, i don't sleep well at all. i have no life at the moment. all my friends are gone, visiting family for the summer. 

i get it. i'm 20. but i'm allowed to be *fucking tired*. jesus christ get off your fucking high horses you pricks. you're not me. this is why i tell nobody anything, because even at 20, going on 21, having financial struggles, mental health and personal issues, and schooling, i'm not allowed to be fucking tired. 

people spwed this shit during the school year too (it's summer now, back in september). i was working 20 to 22 hours a week. i was going to school for 24. i spend 8 to 12 hours a day at school, including classes, 5 days a week. i've been going at 100% since january. i get it, it doesn't seem like a lot to you, but you don't have to tell me my feelings don't matter. 

jesus. fuck off.

edit 2: thank you for all your kind and supportive comments! i hope you all are doing well, and follow the advice you have given me. i do take time to myself, in fact, i ordered a violin to learn how to play this summer! i'm doing my best, and mentally i'm in the best place i've ever been in. i'm glad i could write something that so many people related to.",11
"a drug dealer saved my life. i know it's a hated area. so many drug dealers are the worst people in the entire world but some of them are just people evolved from their surroundings. my dealer was a 35-40 year old black dude named b. and b sold me things for a long time about 3 years. well one day i call b and ask for stuff and he tells me that he concerned on what's out there right now and his last batch wasn't safe. he told me he's known me too long and as he put it he ain't gonna let his young bull go out like that. 

so i make another call to a friend of his named curtis and met him bc i really wanted shit as i am an addict. well i show up and as i am about to do shit none other then b walks through the door. he slaps the shit outta my hand and scares the shit out of me. not even 3 min later curtis gets a call that someone was found dead and it's probably his shit. this is fetenyl it kills. 

b didn't stop there. he brought me outside and i dunno if it was the day he was having or what but he never looked like this before. he told me that he's done given me shit and that i need to.open my eyes and this isn't a lifestyle. he told me i'm too good for kensington ave and it's deaths and i need to move on. he said he was stuck but not me. and then i left.

b kept his word. no one would answer my calls. the few other guys near his block would tell me keep fuckin walking bc they knew me. this led me to really think and go get help i needed especially from withdrawl

today i am 1 year and 7 months clean. i got a good job and and clear head. so when you hate a drug dealer it's understandable but just know they are human too and some of them wish they weren't trapped by drugs whether they use or not. i can tell you by the look in b's eyes that day, he would do anything to have not made his early mistakes and been in jail and be out of the drug scene.

update: wow is all i can say almost. this is crazy i never thought this would blow up like this. thank you all so much for the support your an amazing group of people. i thought for sure people would hate this because of the topic but i am blown away. obviously maybe i was the closed minded one thinking people wouldn't like it bc 1. it's another drug addict post and 2. that story about b and people tend to hate dealers. 

but really thank you all so much. as for anyone wondering about b from what i have heard is he might be back in jail. he refused my calls so i never got to talk to him again but i am going to try and maybe write him a letter if he is in jail. he really did save me and maybe he's done a million things wrong but he saved me from a sure death. again thank you all and please anyone trying to get clean seek help. also in my own personal philosophy look out for signs. when u buy that bag of dope if there's a rehab billboard in front of you maybe the universe is telling you something? good luck to all of you!",11
"(anorexia outpatient recovery) instead of starving myself today, i ordered pizza. i really didn't want to eat anything, been taking a few steps back with recovery lately. but i ordered a pizza today and ate a few slices. and you know what? the pizza tasted glorious. i feel like i won a battle today.

"my bf spends 10 minutes on my balcony each day. he just stares at all my plants and says ""you've done a good job"" and proceeds to patiently listen to me explain every single new plant development in great detail.

"i laugh when i think about my best friend's funeral.. my best friend lost her battle with cancer about 15 years ago. she fought strong and hard for most of her life and she was 25 years old when she passed away. 

the service was at a baha'i temple and it was hours long. i remember thinking she would have been so pissed if she had to sit through something like this. but, it was lovely, nonetheless.

at the burial site, a fucking crane, carrying her coffin on a small, loud-ass bulldozer (she was a very big girl) was reversing while its back-up-beeper is just blaring, and echoing throughout this tiny corner in the cemetery. the person speaking was literally yelling over this truck/crane/fucking back-up-beeper.

then... the crane starts swinging and her coffin hits and breaks a nearby headstone. all the cemetery guys have been called over. they're on their walkie-talkies, frolicking through our funeral and shit. meanwhile, the god damned fuckin tractor is still running.

the step-mom, overcome with emotion, faints. upon seeing this, the mom pretends to faint, so the step couldn't one-up her.

now come the fire department and the police, with their sirens blaring.

now, the women refuse to leave the scene until their daughter is buried in the ground, so the emt guys stuck around and kinda awkwardly  joined our funeral.

it was a scene from one of the most amazing movies i had ever witnessed in real life. every time i think about it, i fucking crack up.

i sometimes feel guilty when i am telling other people about it and legit can't breathe because i'm laughing so hard.

my friend was one of the most inappropriately hilarious people i had ever met in my life. i know she's laughing with me.",11
"i overheard my boyfriend asking my dad for his blessing.. on christmas! i had gone to bed, and they were chatting by the fire in the room next to mine. unbeknownst to them, i could clearly hear their conversation as my dad gave my partner his enthusiastic permission to marry me. 
a few moments later, my boyfriend came in and i pretended to be asleep. he kissed me sweetly on the forehead and held me for a few minutes as i snuggled up to him. he seemed to be extremely relieved. merry christmas, indeed! :-) 

edit: wow!!!! i went to sleep and woke up to so many sweet messages and comments! thank you all so very much- it's so awesome to be reminded to hold gratitude during this time. 

edit 2: this is coming up in the comments a lot, so i thought i would address it! my father was not at all expecting or requesting to be asked, as we are a pretty liberal and non-traditional california family. asking the father's permission is not common in my boyfriend's culture either. one day i offhandedly mentioned to my so that if we were to get engaged, i thought giving my dad a heads up and asking for his blessing (more like 'hey, are you cool with this?') would be an awesome way for them to connect without me, and would make my dad feel comfortable and respected. it makes me feel so loved that he made that extra effort :-) 

thank you for the gold!!!!!

i got it!!!!!. so i applied for a job at the mcdonald's (yeah i know it's not the best but i can't work anywhere else) by my school. i got a text for an interview less than an hour later. today was the interview day and after only 5 questions the lady offered me a job and my orientation is next week monday. i'm super excited seeing as this is my first ever official job.,11
"i can just step over this thing, but my colleague in a wheelchair can't. what is wrong with people?. went to a meeting on the third floor of a building. met a colleague there who gets around in a wheelchair. she's funny, and smart, and competent, and it was my first time sitting in a meeting with her. she made jokes about how she brought her own chair and didn't need one of the provided ones. she was amazing and good at her job. 

she had a hard stop, and we left the meeting together. she had a lunch appointment to make. on the way out, i waited for the elevator with her. it was an eternity. there was a tremendous cacophony of bangs and noise coming from the elevator shaft. when it finally came, it was packed full of beer kegs, a dolly, and a man. he smiled, and apologized, clearly sorry. there was a restaurant on the ground floor, and they have to store their beer somewhere. fair enough. not going to carry it up the stairs. we waited again as he unloaded it. when the elevator finally did get back to us, we were relieved. 

until we got to the ground floor, where there was an electric pallet jack sitting directly in front of the elevator door. with an empty pallet on it. what the fuck would she have done if she was alone? this woman would have been forced to yell for help until someone came to move the jack. i didn't know how to operate it. i had to drag that heavy thing out of the way. 

i had my privilege checked. big time. i wouldn't have given it a second thought if i was alone. hop over it. be on my way. i honestly don't think it would have occurred to me either that leaving something in front of the elevator could have been so damaging to another person's dignity, mobility - their freedom of movement. i should have thought to take pictures. 

i hope after reading this you will think about it now too. i certainly won't forget it. i can't stop thinking about it. i want to reach out to her, tell her how angry i am about it. tell her that i see the world differently. but that would just be for me, it wouldn't do anything for her. she carried on with her head held high. probably not the first time she had to deal with this. and she's not alone out there.",11

"an ode to my cheating husband, from your wife who can't sleep. you are a compulsive liar

one might say your pants are on fire

you couldn't keep away from tinder

and now our marriage is a cinder

-

you had cyber sex on messenger

i even had to question her

you gaslighted me, got mad, denied

but your mouth twitched every time you lied 

-

this time when you cheated

i finally admitted i was defeated

four years of love, two of marriage

done. finished. a relationship miscarriage.

-

you haven't even moved out yet mate

and i saw you on the street with your tinder date 

what lies have you told her about us?

i guess you're ready to destroy another girl's trust

-

i lie awake at night, i think and cry

i constantly ask you why, why, why

you can only say 'i don't know fam'

'i need space', 'don't tell me what to do, damn'

-

you're mentally ill and i can't fix you

i've tried and tried, it won't do

i understand you're very depressed

that's no excuse to treat me 10th best

-

i helped you grow from a boy to a man

i must've failed somewhere in my plan 

i'm no longer proud of who you are

lying and cheating: a memoir

-

next week you move out, i'm all alone

i'll waste nights lamenting by phone 

about the man who was my best friend

the man who vowed to stay til the end

-

i'm proud to say i'm not a doormat

so now it's just gonna be me and the cat

my heart hurts so much and i love you so

but i know i'll be alright. you have to go.",11

the cashier turned around, grabbed a sandwich, and handed it to me. she told me to just take it and have a nice day. if she ever sees this reddit post, thank you for the free lunch, it means more to me than you know.

"my dad would hate me if he knew i did this.. i'm 27 and male. i work at a hotel where most of the rooms are empty and don't get used. i very often find myself with maybe 40 minutes to an hour of free time at work and i use that time by going to one of the empty rooms where all the items are pushed to the sides against the walls and covered in dust sheets. i close the curtains and i put my bag on the bottom of the curtains so no light comes in and then i wait for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. i then proceed to warm up and put my headphones in and i do ballet. i have been doing it for years and i teach myself the techniques and ""moves"". my dad is against anything that shows flamboyance in the slightest and would always refer to me as a sissy if i did something less than manly.

when i woke up in the middle of the night i realised she had filled my water bottle up for me in case i needed it in the night (which i almost always do)

"today i cried over the lawn. i am a woman who knows no bounds. i used to be married to a man who did all the ""manly"" things and made me feel as if i couldn't do them simply because i didn't know how or i wasn't strong enough.

since he up and left me for a girl he met on tumblr 8 months ago with only himself and his own happiness on his radar, i have changed my flat tire, got my oil changed, changed the filter on my furnace, fixed my garbage disposal, recaulked my tub and a final task that i have been dreading.

i mowed my lawn. that part wasn't the hard part. getting the mower to start was the hard part. i put the gas in, checked the oil, put starter fluid near the carburetor, figured out how to push the little bar down and pull the trigger at the same time, and eventually cleaned the spark plug. it took a good half hour to get it started but i did it. all on my own. 

when i finished mowing the front and backyard i stood looking out over my lawn and i cried.

after all he put me through, moving across the country for him, getting a new job, being promoted in a year and a half, him leaving me in a place where i don't have any blood family, having to adjust to live by myself after 9 years, paying for everything on my own, and mowing the lawn i cried for everything i never thought i could do.

i cried because i claimed my independence and my house today. i can do anything.

before i left to go to work this morning, just as i'm standing at the door i always say "" love you pickle, have a good day at school"" and today she turned to me and said ""have a good day at work daddy too, love you"".

i almost broke down in tears. i've not cried in years, even when my nan passed last year, i hold everything in. she really made my day saying that. it really is the smallest things in life that get you by and that sentence she said almost broke me. i've been in such a good mood all day so far because of her, even if work is currently stressful, she's getting me by.",11

 turns out one of those places was an excellent company that loves to give unexperienced graduates a chance, while mentoring them into the role. most of their staff end up staying on for 20+ years. 

next week my life changes, 10 years ago i was hopitalized for multiple suicide attempts, and while i never thought this could be possible, i'm not scared for my future. i can't believe that i believe this, but i earned this. i deserve this.

"stop sexualising my job.. i work as a nurse. i'm currently seeing a guy who's amazing etc but when i was on dating sites or just irl almost every single guy would make some comment about how sexy a nurse is. ""oooo a sexy nurse"" ""bet you look good in that outfit"" etc. 

i've dedicated my life to saving and improving other people's. doing cpr on a patient for 20 minutes waiting for the ambulance to arrive because i'm on a community posting. working 13 hour shifts spending most of it dehydrated with a full bladder because i'm so overworked. getting covered in blood from a road traffic collision. comforting family members when their loved ones die. constantly monitoring my patients to ensure they recover as best they can. i spend 40 hours a week working in a super stressful environment whilst studying another 40 hours in the same week to make myself a better nurse. seeing more dead people at the age of 23 than most 70 year olds have through their full life. performing cpr on a choking child at a restaurant on my day off and saving the child's life and seeing the pure relief from the parents. 

this is why i'm a nurse, not to fulfil your sexual fantasies. 

my career is saving lives, not giving you a hard on. 

i'm dedicated to saving peoples lives and maybe yours too one day. 

please don't sexualise my career. it diminishes everything i've done and do. i'm not an object for your desire. 


rant over.

edit: thank you guys for all the kind comments. i hope you all have good health and happiness. here's my time to preach, please learn proper cpr technique, you may never use it but if you do you can save a life.

edit 2: some people asked for a reliable source on current best practice for cpr. here's a link from the nhs that gives technique for all age groups, from new born babies to adults source(https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/first-aid/cpr/). if you're in an emergency situation doing cpr you can recruit members of the public to take over as cpr is exhausting.",11

i've been struggling with my mental health for 2 years.  
first came a depression when i was about 13, which slowly turned into mood swings.  
i don't remember not hating myself for longer than a month at a time.  
everything that i didn't do correctly would feel like a character flaw, everything positive was just ""normal and everyone should be able to do that"".  
i am failing school, i've neglected my life.

but today, with the help of medication and my loved ones, i finally cleaned my room.  
it might not seem like a lot, but for me it's the first step in breaking the invisible wall i created for myself.

we play games, watch movies and tv together, go for breakfast, play outside on the play structure and a bunch of other stuff. 

both kids call me dad and i literally just feel my heart melt every time she calls me dad. 

then when my girlfriend comes home, the fun doesn't just stop there, we all hangout and wrestle with each other. usually it's them against me but oh well! 

i miss her son too but i'll get to see him on friday and spend time with him too. play video games or code some programs or our very own little video games together. 

i love her and ""our"" kiddos. 

they are starting to see how their bio dad is controlling, emotionally abusive and manipulative. there's been many nights of talks i've had with both kids talking about their frustrations with him or crying about shit he's done.

"when did we loose our humanity. okay so yesterday someone reversed into my car while it was parked at daycare where i was dropping my kid off at, i had just gotten out of the car myself with my kid. the person who reversed into my car pulled over to the side. this person was very clearly shaken. they were trying to hold back tears. 

i myself have been in a similar situation where i accidentally caused damage to someone else's car and i remembered the feeling of guilt so well (it's not something that will ever leave me).

so when this person got out of their car and kept apologising i remained calm and asked them where they okay, they said they were. i also asked was the baby in the car okay, and they replied that the baby was fine. the person kept apologising and shaking. they gave me details on how to contact them. so we both went and dropped the kids off to. while walking back out i noticed this person was still shaking and crying. i comforted them and asked them where they okay to get home, they said they were. 

as the day continued and i was at work something clicked with me that i actually knew who this person was and i was friends with their daughter. i decided to contact their daughter to make sure they were okay, because i couldn't get the worry out of my mind (they had mentioned a health condition when i was reassuring them). the daughter got back to me to tell me that they were still in shock and that they were soo sorry. they also asked about the damage to my car. i told them that i would get it assessed when i left work and let them know. i also told them that i really just wanted to make sure that the person was okay. 

after work i got the damage assessed and the person gave me a number of quotes depending on how they fixed my car... i told them i wanted the cheapest option as this person had been through enough and they didn't need extra financial concerns added to their worries. the repair man seemed shocked when i said this and said ""most people go for the most expensive option and get panels replaced"" now why would i do this when the damage could be repaired for a fraction of the cost baffles me. 

later on i was talking with someone else about what happened and they said ""why aren't you claiming for whiplash"" to which i replied ""well i wasn't even in the car and more importantly it's not true""  they were like ""well i would be saying i was in the car and i have whiplash""...

when did we start going down this path where all we do is claim? why would we make life so awkward for another person? 
can't we all have a bit of humanity and realise that we are human... we make mistakes... accidents happen! don't make life harder for others than it already is! 

disclaimer: i know i'm not perfect and sometimes i do make things harder for others even though i do try my best not to.

thank you to anyone who read this... i just needed to get this off my chest!

"living in hong kong, reddit is the only place that reminded me what normal is. everyday, there are news of teargas going off somewhere, it's just the matter of which street or which train station. and i've been to all of these places, maybe to visit a friend, or maybe it's where my special pizza place is at, or maybe it's just a 20-minutes walk away from where i live. now it's all so suffocating... and not just because of these damn teargas.

after the teargas, people would be brutally beaten then arrested. those are nasty scenes, and you can see pure hatred in their eyes. some high-ranking officers called us cockroaches. you whip out your pesticide and stomp those creatures to death. and it just so happens that these creatures are us.

the local forum is a mess, seeing so many people trying to navigate this when we're equally clueless, trying to make sense with the broken pieces we could gather. people have gotten ptsd, and for those who haven't... for me, i have trouble sleeping. i'm lucky enough to be able to pay for therapy, at least. but not the others who need it direly.

i don't see a future. i don't even know when i'll die. maybe this sunday, during another upcoming march, shot dead by the incoming chinese army.

browsing reddit today, the normality shocked me. cats, something to do with weddings, entitled shoppers, tea with biscuits, lawns... it is so easy to forget i had a normal life just a few weeks ago, in a modern, commercial, vibrant city.

don't take it for granted.",11
"i'm fucking doing it!!. i've paid off 80% of my debt, i'm busting ass in my amazing job, i finally cut off the abusive asshole i let dictate my life for over a year, and i'm going to be saving to fix my totaled car i worked my ass off to buy brand new two years ago.

the last two years have been filled with drugs, alcohol, arrests, abuse, homelessness, fear, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and being an irresponsible mess of a human. but fuck it you guys i'm finally on the right track again and i've never fucking felt better.

thanks for listening, just needed to let that out!!

edit: dude! so much love, reddit is awesome, you guys are all awesome!! thanks for the gold and silver, you guys really know how to make a girl smile!",11
"so now i have a toothbrush at his place. he(30m) asked me(27f) if he could leave a toothbrush for me at his place, and i answered something like ""oh, no need to worry, i always carry one with me"". he looked crestfallen for a second, and then i understood what he meant. quickly, i said ""but it would be really easier to have one here. now i can leave the one i always carry around at work!"".  


his face just lighted up in a way i can't describe. really, he is so very handsome, he is so very sweet.  


in retrospect, i should've get the meaning of his request at the very moment he asked. maybe these last 5 years alone, recovering from the worst relationship you can imagine, that left me a little rusty. but now i'm ready. and i want to do this with him. i have a healed heart, a healed mind, and so much love to give. after so long, i can finally say i love myself and i love someone else. so now i have a purple toothbrush at his place.",11
"my son told me ""good night"" all on his own. my five year old has autism and for the most part is nonverbal. he usually requires prompting to say anything, and doesn't always understand the meaning behind the words he's speaking. 


tonight he came up to me, leaned in for a kiss and very clearly said ""good night"". no one told him to say it. we didn't even tell him it was time for bed. he was simply ready to go on his own and voluntarily told me good night. it caught me so off guard. i'm absolutely over the moon :)",11
"i got my skull caved in and it's simultaneously the worst and maybe also, the best thing that's ever happened to me.. i'll start with the bad stuff first: 

so i'm 3 days into my spring break with 4 friends in colorado. initially, i didn't want to go because i had a bad feeling about it. i actually called my mom a few days prior to leaving, trying to get her to convince me not to go. but she didn't, so i went. me and my friends made it there safe and we went sightseeing everyday, and so i'm actually having fun at this point. night comes and we all smoke some weed that we got at a dispensary earlier that day. some time passes and i don't feel high so i take one on my edible gummies that i bought. one of the friends that's with us is a giant stoner and tells me that there's no way that just taking one will do anything to me. i know that's not true at all but, i listen to her anyway and take 3 like she told me to. within minutes, i go from having a great time to being way too uncomfortably high, and she thinks it's hilarious. and everyone else does too. 
	
so i watch tv and try to stay calm until it wears off. when it finally does, i go to bed. before falling asleep, i lay out everything that i'm going to wear tomorrow when i finally get to ski for the first time in my life. i go to sleep so excited, it's insane and i'm still a little high. 
	
i start dreaming, at first they're regular nonsense dreams, but then i start thinking that i've been asleep for a very long time. it's like that little alarm that goes off when you've overslept for work or something. anyway the dreams start getting really weird, the first one that a remember is being wheeled into a japanese hospital, then blackness for the longest time. after that i would would have little flashes of waking up in a hospital room, with a view of a tokyo skyline out of my window and then i would start to vomit uncontrollably, which is something i'm used to because i have stomach problems due to anxiety. sometimes i would hear my dads or moms voice. but those didn't happen often, it was mostly black. blackness with only thoughts. as time went on, i started to become aware that i couldn't wake up no matter how hard i tried. at this point, i know that something is really really wrong. 
	
all the sudden, i have one of those hospital room dreams, and in walks kurt cobain and he asks if i want to talk, i say yes and then we're on a bench outside. he's asks if i know what's going on and i say no. i don't remember what he says happened to me but i had the understanding that i was in a bad way. then he said that i'm going to be fine and this is all about to end. then blackness again. 
	
then it finally happens, i wake up for real this time. guess what? i'm in a hospital room. my parents are sitting across the room, both on their phones. i can't believe my eyes. i go to run my hand through my hair and there is none. my head is shaved and a line of staples going from the part in my hair to my ear in a huge u shape. my parents see me awake and rush over to me. my mom asks me if i know what's going on and when i go to say no, i realize that i have absolutely no clue how to actually say no, or any other word for that matter. 
	
anyways, this is what actually happened. the night that i fell asleep high wasn't the end of the story. i actually woke up the next morning and drove with my friends to the ski rental place in the snow. on the way there we hit some ice going around a corner and started to spin. we where on a mountain road and ended up in the other lane right in front of a suv going over the speed limit. we were t-boned and so hard that we spun back into our lane and got rear ended by the truck that was behind us. i just don't remember any of that happening at all. 
	
no one in the car knows what i hit my head on, but i was out cold immediately. the stoner chick that i mentioned earlier was sitting next to me and broke a couple of fingers in the impact and demanded to get out. her door was smashed shut and so she decided to crawl over my body, knocking me over in the process, she also wasn't wearing a seatbelt. i started to bleed profusely out of my nose, mouth, and ears. this was because i had sustained a 3 inch depression fracture on my temple in the crash which had shifted my brain the the other side of my skull, as well as two other skull fractures. i also broke my nose, both cheekbones, and my tailbone. i was loaded into a ambulance and taken on a 2 hour ride to level 1 trauma center. i was intubated and sedated. my parents were called and left work the get on a flight from texas to colorado immediately. i got my skull put back together with hardware and i remained in a coma for 4 days until they realized that i had gotten pneumonia, which almost killed me. so 8 days later, i woke up. 
	
the expectation for someone with my injury would be a pretty dramatic change in quality of life, but i woke up and mentally i was pretty normal, it took some work, but i started to walking again. and quickly i basically learned how to talk again, although i talk very slow. every doctor i've talk to since, has said a that i'm beyond lucky. i'm a little slower now and i can't function without stimulants. but everything is different now, i don't even feel like the same person at all sometimes. i think of the person i was before the accident in the way you'd probably remember a friend that had passed away. it's fucking weird. it feels like i had all these memories uploaded into me. the whole thing has been such a colossal mindfuck. 

here's the good part:

	i sat in that hospital bed and thought about my whole life and how since early childhood i've felt this dark cloud over me, and suddenly it was gone. like i had been miserable my whole life. i've thought all of the horrible things about myself my whole life and i realized it's all bullshit. i am attractive, i am worthy of love, i am smart, i have great judgment, and people fucking love me. for so long i was paralyzed by these feelings and after almost losing my life, i realized what i really have. and beyond that, i'm not afraid of anything. what else can life do to me? what's the pain of rejection compared to the pain of that i've already gone through? it's nothing.

it's been just 3.5 months since the accident and i spent a month in the hospital but i'm finally back to life. and i'm determined to live it the best way that i can. i've found the power of positive thinking and i know now that's the only way that i made it through this. i've started to take up for myself and believe in myself. it sounds crazy, but i feel like this experience has taught me so much that i'm actually grateful for it in some ways. life actually looks beautiful to me now. i'm so glad i'm only 24 and there's still time to enjoy it!",11
"i'm going to live rent free as soon as i leave my parents house. i can't tell anyone in real life because i don't want them to look at me differently. when my siblings and i were young, our parents bought a nice flat for each of us in a good neighbourhood for when we want to move out. we didn't know about this until this year. my older sibling is 25 and i'm 23 and we both have plans on moving out soon. we literally don't have to look for somewhere to live neither will we have to worry about paying rent! we both work good jobs and only need to pay a $25 service charge for rubbish collection and security. i feel so so lucky and blessed and thankful to my parents. such a huge burden squashed. a lovely 3 bed flat all to me. the title deeds are going to be changed to our names by the end of this year. i am so excited for this! i feel really so so lucky.


edit: i did not expect this to get this much traction! thank you so much to everyone who's been so kind to me and wished me well! i'm trying to reply to everyone but i'm back at work now so i might be kinda slow. thank you as well to anyone who's been unkind because you've reminded me why it's a bad idea to tell people in real life.

and i've always wanted to say this: thank you kind stranger for my first precious stone!!! 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛",11
"i opened a restaurant this year and not a single family member or friend has been in.. it hurts.

we're busting our butts and doing so good only 6 months in!

my mom will ask questions like ""so these are really people just coming off the street and not people you know?"" kinda stings. we've created a dope space with amazing food, why wouldn't people off the street wander in? guess you'd have to actually come in to understand that...

update: damn, i just needed to get that off my chest real quick! haha. sorry for a later reply. we've been preparing for a little event this evening. i appreciate all the support thoroughly! it means so much to see all of the encouragement. it's been a process. we've definitely made new friends along the way and i'm forever appreciative of that. no need for any fake reviews cause i know we are killing it, i just gotta get over proving that to my mom and friends.",11
"i was raped by my girlfriend.  i am a 36-year-old guy and i was raped fifteen years ago by my then-girlfriend, who was 19.

i was 21 and she was the cutest girl probably on campus, and we took half the same classes. i was literally head over heels with her and after a few months, i asked her out and she said yes. we went on two or three dates and i thought i'd found the one. this girl was amazing, she was beautiful, really smart, and fun to be around.

she was driving us back from a restaurant on the fourth date, i think it was, when she stopped the car off on a side road all of a sudden. i looked at her, and she went on top of me. i tried to push her off but she pinned my hands down and started kissing me. i asked her what was up, and she said she was going to ""reward"" me by having sex together for the first time. i tried to say i wasn't really in the mood, it had been a long day and i wanted our first time to be more special but she'd already unbuttoned my pants. i really tried to get her off then but as much as it sucks to admit it, i'm not a very big guy and this girl was strong enough to keep me down. i decided to just let her go on, maybe she'd get tired. after her getting on me, though, i'd had enough.  
""i'm done,"" i told her. but we had already started. her eyes were closed and she went on for about five more minutes before she got off and i sat up and buttoned my pants.  
""you raped me,"" i said, and she laughed out loud. i honestly think she didn't believe she had raped me, because i was a guy and guys always want sex, don't they?  
""you're welcome,"" she said and she put the car into gear as if everything was fine. i let her drive us up back to my dorm which was only a few minutes away and when she tried to follow me, i told her i felt really sick and would catch her later. she scoffed but left and i went upstairs and just lay there all night long, not able to sleep.

i told my roommates the other day what had happened and they both clapped me on the back, telling me ""good job"". i decided i wasn't raped. there's no way a guy could get raped by a girl two years younger than him.  
i tried to forget about it. when she texted me a few days later asking if i wanted to go to this party her friend was throwing, i went, and then before it was over, pulled her aside and broke up with her. i blocked her out and ignored my friends telling me ""she got away"" and i made a huge mistake.  
for fifteen years, i've been telling myself nothing happened to me, i'm not a pu\*\*y, i didn't get raped by a girl.

today i admit it. yeah, i was raped. yeah, she was two years younger than me. yeah, i'm a guy. i don't fucking care. i was raped. i was raped and it's destroyed me, been destroying me since the day it happened.",11
"today is the first day in years that i woke up and didn't immediately think about killing myself. i feel great.. i've had severe depression for almost 5 years, and i've been suicidal for about as long. when i woke up this morning, instead of having to fight the urge to kill myself, instead i lay awake and couldn't stop smiling. it felt amazing.

i put on an outfit i haven't worn in years, and i felt so good about myself walking through the city listening to music on my phone. it was like i could all of a sudden see everything i've been missing for the last 5 years. i saw beauty in the trees on the side of the road, seeing kids playing at a park made me genuinely happy, the weather was gorgeous. everything felt wonderful.

i put fresh strings on my guitar and played it for the first time in months. it felt so nice to finally be able to feel joy from something that i used to love.

i just finished watching some favourite movies of mine and i'm sitting here browsing reddit and my guinea pig is eating lettuce next to me.

this might not seem like much to anyone else, and there's a chance that no one will ever see this, or even care, but i just feel like i need to shout it from the roof tops!

the world is a beautiful place and i can't wait to wake up again tomorrow.",11

"i got hired!! it's been a rough jobless year.. only 50$ bucks left in my account. thank god. okay so i still can't believe i got this job! it feels so unreal! 

so i have been job searching since last august, and the last four months of the search i basically lost all motivation and felt like there was no where to go. luckily, i still pushed through it. 

i was actually hired a week prior for min.wage position that offered no benefits and just bad. the day before i started that position i got an email for a phone interview. i squeezed it in before heading to my first day of work. a couple hours later they wanted to set up an interview for the next day. i quickly went to the manager and asked if i could leave early tomorrow since i had a prior appointment ( i felt bad but i figure it was a good excuse because they hired me on the spot with no notice on the start date) but they said no. i went home and realized that i really wanted this job, so i took the risk of resigning after one day of work. the next day i was about to head out for the interview but i got an email saying they needed to reschedule. my heart dropped and the rush of regret of quitting set in. my mind started racing and i started to realize that i probably won't get this job. i quickly rushed back on indeed and starting sending out my resumes yet again. luckily, we ended up rescheduling for the next day. i went and the interview went food, but i knew i messed up a couple times. when i got home my anxiety was to the roof because now i had to play the waiting game. the next day i felt so bad and constantly checked my email. i was prepared to get a rejection letter or to be ghosted. then around 11 am i got an offer email!! i couldn't believe my eyeballs lol. 

the location is great, the pay is over 45% more then what i was getting, i get to wear jeans, and i get benefits!! 

i'm so glad i took that risk and can't believe i got such a good paying job with a political science major. 

i can't wait to buy a new outfit and buy a beer with my first paycheck. it's been way too long since i had a meal other then ramen and eggs. i'm so relieved that i can pay of my student loads and start trying to bring my credit up.


edit- 

i want to really thank everyone for congratulating me! i feel extremely excited and motivated by everyone's good words and i am so happy to be able to share this with people since i really didn't have anyone to tell! 

i am also glad this motivated people who are also still searching for a job. don't give up, and don't sell yourself short! 

thank ya!! :d",11
"i experienced my first kiss last night. i'm a 19 year old male who went on a date last night. this is the first time i've hung out with this girl outside of work. we basically spent the whole date talking and getting to know each other. the last 15 minutes were the highlight though. we were sitting in my car listening to music and we started to share really personal stuff with each other to which i brought up the fact that i've never kissed a girl. she originally thought i was kidding but i reassured her i wasn't. she wrapped her arms around my arm and rested her head on my shoulder saying she didn't want to go home yet. i was terrified, i didn't know if i should make a move but i knew deep down i would hate myself if i didn't at least try. i asked if i could kiss her, she sat up and asked if i really wanted her to be my first kiss. she was surprised but in a good way. i said i was positive. we kinda stared at each other for a minute and then i just went for it, i leaned in and kissed her for about 3 or 4 seconds. she smiled afterwards and then went back to laying her head on my shoulder with one arm wrapped around my arm while she held my hand with the other. some of the best 15 minutes of my life.

tl;dr - i experienced my first kiss with a girl.",11
"i've gone 2 full days with no fast food or regular soda!!. i know it seems stupid but i've been addicted to fast food and soda since i was very little. i grew up in a household where i was given soda at 6 months and fast food as soon as i could eat. i'm finally over 300lbs and a single mom. i'm doing this for us. i won't have my daughter feel the way i've felt my entire life. small changes first! this is the hardest change for me but i'm ready. i just wanted to tell someone. thanks for letting me get it off my chest!

edit: i never expected this to blow up the way it did! thank you strangers for all the support and encouragement! i've never had this kind of support in my life. i'm so grateful for everyone who read my post and left me tips and nice words. today is day three. if i feel like eating bad or drinking soda i will come back to this post and read all these comments. 
also a thanks to the strangers for my first gold and silver!! thank you everyone for the support!",11
"so, i just started reading a book to my girlfriend.... my (long distance) girlfriend has always liked going to sleep to the sound of my voice. every night, even when she's about ready to collapse from exhaustion, she'll call me up, crawl in bed, set up her camera so we can see each other, and wait for me to start talking. she says it's comforting and that she doesn't like being/feeling alone when she drifts off. i don't mind, she's so sweet and watching her slowly fall asleep is the goddamn cutest thing ever. 

and so, for the past year, i've tried a lot of different things; sometimes i'll make up a story as i go, other times i'll just tell her about my day or what's on my mind. you name it, i've probably done it. recently however, she told me that she wanted me to read her a story. i can't believe i didn't ever think of that! of course i said yes, i even drove all the way to her place to pick up a book of her choosing from her sizable collection.

last night we started reading the tale of despereaux together and i've never been more happy. it's small things like this that remind me of how much i love her. she relished every second of it; sometimes she'd ask me to give certain characters goofy voices, other times she'd sit there in a tense silence waiting to hear what happened next as i flipped the page. in the end, when she was only about half awake and only occasionally murmuring, i whispered my normal good night.

""good night, i love you so much!! have good dreams and a nice day tomorrow, i'll talk to you later.""

after barely managing to mumble out the sweetest ""i love you to,"" i've ever heard she went to sleep. it was so perfect, it was as if we were living out a charming love story of our own. now all i can think about is tomorrow night, i just want to spend more time with her. i want to hear her giggle at my bad french accent, i want to see the particular face she makes when a character she doesn't like does something, most of all i just want her to wake up so i can tell her how much i love her. she really is a blessing, i'm lucky to have someone so kind and pure.

tl;dr: my girlfriend wanted me to read a book to her, it went very well. i love her to bits.

edit: i took a brief nap and damn did i reach a helluva lot of people. thanks for all the lovely vibes, recommendations, and even my first ever reddit gold this'll only make our story time that little bit sweeter when we do it again tonight. i'm glad this post was able to touch so many people; love is contagious and anything i can do to spread it around a little bit is good by me. love y'all so much!!",11
"i just spent 3 hours with the newly arrived refugees from syria, and they made me cry.. excuse any spelling mistakes, i'm on mobile.

yesterday 78 refugees arrived in my small town in germany. many people have already been talking about how dangerous they will be and women will be disrespected by them and they'll kill us. that type of ignorant bullshit.

my friend went yesterday to the encampment, inside what once was a small shopping center. she said the men were so nice to her and her daughter that she wanted to go again today to see if they needed help with anything else. i asked if i could go as well to help.

we arrived there at around 9:30 and most of the men were still sleeping. i thought it would be rude to take pictures so i didn't get any of the inside... but just imagine a place where the walls are white and inmates are put 4 to a cell in bunk beds, and each ""cell"" was sectioned off with metal fences they use for construction sites, with some white plastic attached to it so the men had privacy from anyone walking in.

my friend had brought cigarette lighters for the men since all of them smoke (except the youngest, 16). the people in charge didn't really know what to do with us, but then i told them my first language is english, and they right away brought us to a syrian doctor who could speak excellent english. 

he told me what the refugees needed and i translated that to the boss running the encampment. at one point some men told him they needed shoes, because theirs were falling apart (literally). we split the people into groups because others wanted to go get groceries, and others wanted to take the bus into town for other stuff. we went with the group to get shoes and jackets.

5 men came with us. they all had thin jackets on and no umbrella,  and it was raining like cats and dogs as we were walking.  they got completely soaked on the way over. i had an umbrella and didn't use it because i felt shitty that i could stay dry and yet they would get soaked. however, one of the guys (a 16 year old) told me in hand gestures that he would hold the umbrella for me, and he held it over us the whole way to the store.  and i'm supposed to believe now that all muslim men disrespect women? no. never again. 

in the store my friend bought them umbrellas, because their money that they had (200 euros for one month) could be spent on better things. she doesn't earn much either, and i thought that was really kind of her to do.

on the way back i was trying to learn some arabic words, and i asked about mama and papa. one guy said his mom and dad are in syria still. then he said brothers, showed me two fingers, and then made a shooting gesture and said is. he said freedom as he showed me the gesture for handcuffs, and said ""gone"". i cried. i looked at him and the brother that is still living (the 16 year old) and i fucking could not stop crying. these poor fucking men. they have nothing but broken shoes and a few clothes, had a third of their family fucking killed by is, and then they get stared at by fucking germans with looks of disgust on their faces. 

i apologized to the two brothers. it made them sad to see me sad,  they said. they called me ""sadiq"", which means friend in arabic, and that touched me. they showed me pictures of their mom and dad and little sister and asked if they could take pictures with me so they could send them to their families. i'm glad that they and their families know there is someone here that wants to help them.

fuck stereotypes. these people want to be happy just like everyone else in this fucking world. and even though i only helped them by showing them where the store was, i hope that they know now that there are people here in germany that want them here. i want these men to be safe, to be able to go back home one day to their families and be fucking happy.

i wish with all my heart that everyone in this world would want the same for everyone else.


edit: i just would like to also say that there are *so* many people in germany who want to help the refugees. just today alone i picked up 10 bags of men's clothes from different people for me to donate to their living place. i mentioned they needed electric kettles to my son's oma, who isn't a fan of refugees, and she offered the two that were in the cellar for me to take. the people here are overall good people, but some buy in to what the media or hate groups say about the refugees. if they'd just take the time to help their minds would be changed. at least, i hope they would be...",11
"i never knew one sentence could end a marriage so abruptly.. i (31f) have been married for 5 years. i love my husband very much, but lately hes been really mean and disrespectful. i can't talk to him about anything concerning us without him flipping out and getting mad. we haven't shared a bed in 3 years and our sex life is next to nonexistent. we don't communicate well and its just getting toxic. we have two children together, and i have an older son with my ex. 


when my husband and i argue it escalates quickly so i always try to remain calm. if it gets bad enough, i take my kids to my moms house until things smooth over. tonight, my husband pushed it too far and i'm seeking a divorce asap. we got into an argument because i was wiping down the counters and his phone went off. so i picked it up, took it over to him and said ""your mom just texted"". he flipped and immediately assumed i went through his phone. i didn't. i happened to see a text come in because he has his notifactions turned on (oops my mistake). 

i asked him why it was a big deal, and he said ""cause i pay the fuckin bill. stay out of my shit"". i'm spent at this point so i just walk away. i hear him mumbling under his breath and slamming things around so i go back. i asked him if its ok if i take the kids to my moms for awhile and he said fine. i let my daughter play with my phone on the way to my moms. by the time we get there, hes texted me going off and calling me names. unfortunately i'm used to that part so i just brushed it off. 

my oldest son from my previous relationship is autistic. i meant to mention that sooner. anyways, brushing off his earlier comments pissed him off so his texts started getting worse. then he sends me the worst sentence i've ever read. 

""have fun changing your sons diapers when hes 30"". my son is 11 and is still in diapers at night. i literally gasped when he sent that. i haven't responded. i can't. i have kids with my husband. i can handle him calling me names and shit, (handle, not like lol) but he crossed a line. i'm done.

"good friend rapes my girlfriend while i'm in the house.. sorry for the format as i am typing this on mobile. this happened back in 2015, and to be frank, i haven't really been able to get it off my chest since. tldr is the title.

story is as follows:
we had been out to a good friends 21st birthday. all was going really well until the bar we were at closed and everyone there left for home around about midnight. a very good friend of mine was crashing at my house that night, along with my girlfriend of 3 years.

we got home, opened a few more drinks and continued the party - just the 3 of us. a few hours went by and i decided to head to bed around 3am. my friend and my girlfriend decided to stay up and keep drinking, which was totally fine by me as they could go off to bed at any point they chose.

fast forward 2 hours and i am awoken by my girlfriend in absolute hysterics. she jumps onto my bed and curls up in the corner, trying to tell me through her tears and hyperventilation that my so called ""friend"" had just raped her. it should be known that whilst i was trying to calm her and find out what she was saying, i could hear someone moving around downstairs which i assumed was my friend as we were the only people at home.

i curled her up in bed and told her to stay put. i then ran downstairs, through the family room and to the kitchen, where i see him entering the door, fully clothed and confront him. 

me: ""why is she upstairs telling me that you've raped her?""

him: ""what are you talking about? i've just gone for a walk and have been gone for an hour!""

me: ""then why is she telling me this? don't lie to me, you were the only people in the house!""

him: ""i don't know, she's just being stupid and making stuff up! why would you accuse me of this?!""

me: ""wait here and do not move!""

i head back upstairs and ask my girlfriend what she remembers. i trust her wholeheartedly but as she was drunk at the time, this is the bit i struggle with. apparently she had passed out from the drinking and been woken up with him on top of her, her trying to get him off and him forcing himself upon her, holding her mouth closed. 

when she managed to break free, she ran up to me and told me what had happened, whilst he quickly got dressed and ran outside to make it look like he wasn't even here.

i kicked him out of the house before i did something i would have regretted, and believe me i wanted to. 

the rest of the day consisted of police visits, forensic examination of the scene and tears. you can't even believe how many tears. the police wanted to press charges, but my girlfriend didn't want to. not once did i think she was lying, but i don't think she could have handled reliving it in detail in court. we had all the evidence we needed to press charges, including his dna from inside her.

fast forward to 2018 and we received a call from the police asking if my (now fiance) could testify against him in another court case. he had raped someone else, and this time would be going away. she refused, and i supported her, although it would have been good to see the look on his face as we stood in front of him with evidence from years prior.

these days we are still together, happily married, have bought our own house and are doing well financially. it still haunts me to this day what happened, and what i or her could have done differently to avoid it altogether or the aftermath. i don't think my wife is over it yet. she doesn't want to talk about it, and wants to deal with it in her own way. in my country, if you are a rape victim you automatically qualify for free counselling for the rest of your life. maybe she should take it up, maybe she shouldn't. i'm not sure. but one thing is for certain, i'll be beside her the whole way.

edit: thanks for the silver! also thanks so much for the 99% of you offering support and your kind words. unfortunately the last 1% just want to offer opinions and blame us for not putting this guy away. all i can say to you is that i truly hope this never happens to you or anyone you know, as acting rationally and with full focus under these circumstances is difficult to say the very least. to those of you wondering why we never pressed charges, it is because in a police interview he agreed that ""something"" happened. in court it would only become a he says/she says scenario and would have been difficult to prove to a jury that it was rape. 
in saying that, in new zealand the police themselves can press charges on a perpetrator if they feel they have a strong enough case, but as he agreed that something happened and was quoted in saying that it was consensual, it would have been difficult to put him away. he was put on the sexual offenders register and it went on his record.

edit 2: thanks to the kind stranger that supplied the platinum!",11
"i got accepted into an ivy league school!!!!. i am so shocked. i'm finally accepted into cornell university. i never thought i'd make it to an ivy. since freshman year of high school i have worked my ass off in and out of the classroom, even going to cornell during the summers of the past to meet with professors and admissions counselors so often to where they know me on a first name basis. everyone told me to aim lower but i really reached for this and i made it. considering that i am from a really small town in upstate new york where no one moves farther than an hour away and almost always goes to a community college i am astounded. this feels great especially as a half native american boy off of the reservation i can proudly say i made it out of the little dead end town that consumes everyone in it. this is truly a miracle. god bless.

"i accidentally killed my pet. naw. i can't stop crying.

it was feeding time this morning, and they always go crazy for food.  i was coming to the room, and stepped over the gate, and loki, one of my bunnies, came running and got right under my foot.  i crushed his head.  he started spasming and had blood coming from his mouth.  i immediately grabbed him and held him, and he passed within a minute.

it was a complete accident, but i feel horrible and i can't stop crying.  he didn't deserve that.  he was one of my favorite guys, and i hurt him the worst way possible.  i hope i can be forgiven.",11
"it's been six years since i died.. i don't know how to start this. i wish i could articulate it beautifully and have it be touching, but i'm unsure i'm gifted with that. however, i'll do my best here.  


specifically, seven years ago, my life spiraled down. my best friend since grade school committed suicide, and to cope, i started taking any drug i could find, or get a hold of. over the counter meds, cocaine, meth, heroin, mushrooms, ecstasy, opioids, literally anything i could get my hands on that i could use to drown the pain out for a little while. i'm bipolar ii, and i stopped taking my psychiatric medications in the process of all this and just let it all escalate to hell. as a result, i lost my family's trust for a long time, my boyfriend at the time left me, i was alone. and i wanted it to end. so i knocked back an entire bottle of pills and crawled into bed.  


if it wasn't for my sibling who came to ask me for a cigarette, and found me incoherent, throwing up, and barely conscious, i wouldn't be here. they had to restart my heart. took three times, but i'm here today.  


i'm here today and i'm six years sober, even off marijuana (it's legal for recreational use in my state). i have a fiance, i'm in nursing school, i have a three year old (turning four this month) daughter. i have a happy life. i'm content. you really do have to get worse to get better.  


i still struggle with suicidal thoughts, but there's no intention behind them.   


so if you, any of you, feel like there is no light, there's no way to reach your end goal, i'm your proof that it is possible. keep trying. keep trekking. it'll take a while, but you'll get there. no matter what means you need to use. 

&#x200b;

i'm rooting for you.",11
"yesterday it was 2 weeks after me and my best friend found his son(3) hanging on a rope on a slide in their backyard.. we just got back from the gym when we walked in the house. his girlfriend was there with 2 of their children, they have 3 but the little daughter was still in school. she was in the living room with the youngest, my friend noticed his other son is not there with his mother so he inmedeatly asked where he is and she told him he was playing in the backyard. they have a playhouse in the backyard with a slide, 2 swings and different ways to climb on to it, i think it is a typical playhouse you see on many playgrounds for kids. he told his girlfriend why she'd let him go alone and she replied that it was only for a couple of minutes and she was heading there as soon as she was done cleaning the youngest, the playhouse is not in eyesview when you are in the house. so my friend mumbles something and went outside to the playhouse, i followed seconds after him with their youngest in my arm. when i got close to the playhouse i heared my friend screaming and yelling and i heared him say my name and that i should call 911, i did not know what was going on at that moment but i knew it was bad,  so i rushed back inside and told his girlfriend to call 911 after i put their youngest down on the floor i rushed back to my friend. when i got to the playhouse i was shocked at first, i saw his 3 year old son hanging halfway in the slide with a rope around his neck and the first thing i thought, he's gone. my friend was in total state of panic and could only scream and cry. as i got closer i noticed his head was blue and again i thought he really is gone. i grabbed on to his body with one hand as i remove the rope around his neck and picked him of the slide, his body had no tension and felt cold, i lay him down on the ground next to the slide and moments after i started cpr. his lips were could and wet and i thought cpr is not going to help him, but i continued for some reason. from here i don't know what exactly happend but what i know is that i saw his mother running towards me and took over the cpr, i was totally fine because i knew she is a fully schooled nurse. i picked up the youngest, she carried him outside when running to the backyard, and walked to my friend who was still in shock and tried to calm him down, by now there was police, firetrucks and a lot of people in the street surounding the backyard. i went back inside with theire youngest so he would not see his brother or the commotion around him.

after 30min or so they left in a ambulance to the hospital. he had a heartbeat before going in to the ambulance and still had when they arrived at the hospital, there they putt him on artificial ventilation and he was in controlled coma. i don't know how i telt about that, is he alive, will he stay like this forever or will he wake up with braindamage? nobody knew at that moment. 

fast forward, yesterday it was 2 weeks after the accident happend and 1 week after he got to go to home, so he is already a week at home, still recovering but damn he is still alive.. never thought it would be possible. as far as they can notice for now it seams that he lost his filter/boarder meaning he does crazy stuff like jumping on the table or just acting goofy but with no limit, his parents have to step in to make sure he ""calmes down"". the other 2 kids are still staying at their grandparents just to take it slow and steady with their 3yo.

i am very happy that he is still alive. a lot of people told me i am the hero in this story, but i sure don't see it that way. after thinking and talking a lot with people who where theire i think that a lot of things happend at the right time so he could live. for example, when me and my friend got out of the gym i told him i wanted to go to the barbershop, he hesitated and told me he first want to go home to drink a shake en then we would take the boys and go to the barbershop. if we went right away his son probably died. and so there are a lot more things that seemed to happend at the right time and as i see it there are many hero's in this story! 

if you lasted this long i want to thank you for reading this and i'm sorry for my english. take care.

edit: he took the rope of one of the swings and used it to slide down, the rope was still connected to the playhouse and it got tangled around his neck when he wanted to slide down. his mother feels guilty, but nobody blaims here, it happend in a moment were she did not see the danger. she played in that same house when she was a child and never thought something like this could happen.

edit2: the boy is doing great! he has passed all of the tests in the hospital. physical he is able to do everything, he does have to build up some more strenght and control in his movements. mentally he is doing great, the only thing is that his boarder/filter is weak or gone(thats uncertain) meaning that he is quickly tired and sometimes exaggerate the typical behaviour of kids his age and needs to be calmed down. but they say it can get better.",11
"i like my crappy life. seven years ago i was 27 and living in chicago with my beautiful girlfriend. i was working a fairly coveted job making 130,000 a year. my girlfriend was pulling in almost 100,000. marriage, buying a home, all that good stuff was right around the corner. 

tragedy stuck and two people really close to me died and it made me question everything i knew. i expressed my hesitation with my life path and she gave me an ultimatum - put a ring on her finger within two years or it would be time to part ways. 

that was best thing she could of ever did. she left a few months later and caused some serious introspection from within myself. she knew what she wanted and i couldn't provide it. 

i look back there now and laugh a little. now i own a sweet 1 br cottage in the woods, but still only 80 minutes from the city. i drag my rickety boat with my rusty suv to fish multiple times a week. i go on the weekdays so it's quiet. i can do that because i work for myself from home - making a modest 60,000 a year, but i am my own boss.

i am relaxed. i am happy. i am healthy. i have met (and lost) some wonderful people. deep down i know that 9-5, a wife, 2.5 kids and soccer practice were not for me and that's ok. 

a part of me does want a kid though, just to tell him it's okay to go off the beaten path, it's okay to aim for something else other than marriage and kids, its okay to climb something other than the corporate ladder. it's okay to listen to yourself.

i wish someone would of told me those things growing up, but i figured them out eventually.",11
"just had sex for the first time, twice!. i (27f) recently left a strict religion and decided to make decisions for myself. after talking to a guy for a few weeks, i decided to have sex! 

he was great and patient and made sure i had a good time, but most importantly it was my decision and i feel so damn free. had sex twice, in several positions, and have never felt more confident in my own skin. 

at 27, i finally had sex and i don't feel clingy, or as though i've lost my value, or anything negative at all.

now to catch up on 10 years worth of sex. woo! ",11
"my dog saved me from making a bad decision last night.. sorry in advance for any rambling. i'm not sure who to talk to about this, or if i'm just making it a bigger deal then it is. also on mobile. 

i went to hang out with my friend last night, just a girls night with some wine. i brought my dog with me because i hate leaving her alone and with wine night there was a chance i would be staying over anyways.

thing did get crazy pretty quickly last night and her boyfriend invited his friends over after dinner. it wasn't a big deal, we all had a merry time drinking, playing games etc. 

i don't remember going to bed, i just remember being in the guest room with my pants off falling asleep, just me and my dog. and then there was a moment when one of his friends opened the door. he kept trying to get into bed with me and i remember saying no, get out. he kept pushing though and walked to the bed and that's when my dog lost it. barking, snarling, showing teeth. he got out of there quick and i fell asleep. 

the whole night she was a total love bug, playing with everyone, letting everyone pet her. she's never had issues with anyone else in my bed before, not that it happens all the time, but generally she just wants to be the center of attention. 

i can't help but to feel like she saved me last night. i don't think she slept a wink because when i came home this morning she went directly to bed and has slept since we got home. 

she'll be getting lots of love and treats today. 


edit: 
i finally had a chance to sit down and talk with my friend about what happened. she told me that her boyfriend tried to convince his friend to not come into my room since the dog was there, and she said that the guy claimed it had ""worked for him before"" so he was determined. he came back stating that all he saw was teeth so that's why he didn't go in, but when my friend heard about the incident the next morning she was furious and told her boyfriend that this guy is not welcome over anymore and when she's hanging with myself (or any of her any friends) he is not welcome to join us. 

overall i'm glad she and i talked, i'm glad my puppy was there to stop him and i hope he learned his lesson, although i doubt it. ",11
"i tell strangers that my dog doesn't normally like people even though he loves everyone. just wanted to post this because it makes me happy and i've never told anyone that i do it. i have a super friendly, happy dog that absolutely loves everyone. sometimes though, if i'm walking him and a stranger comes by and asks to pet him, i tell them ""that's crazy, he doesn't normally like strangers"" when my dog gets super excited to see them. a lie, but the huge smile on the strangers face makes up for it.

edit: wow this blew up while i was asleep, you guys are so sweet!!!!! for you guys that asked for a pic of my dog, here is the man himself: https://imgur.com/gallery/vu7ei2s(https://imgur.com/gallery/vu7ei2s)",11
"my girlfriend turns me down for sex. ..and i couldn't be more happy about it. we've only been dating for a few months, and she comes from a background with some sexual abuse. she made it clear to me that most of what she had done in the past was done out of feeling obligated to, and not actually enjoying it. with me, she'll initiate sex when she wants it, but she also will turn me down. 

her feeling comfortable enough with me to tell me she doesn't want to do anything makes me so happy. i'm ecstatic that she doesn't feel as though our relationship is sex dependent, and that she's confident enough with me to tell me what she wants.

we haven't been dating for all that long, but this coupled with other factors makes me feel like this is the strongest basis for a relationship i've ever had, and the future of it excites me like nothing else.",11
"mentally healthy people put too much hope in suicide prevention hotlines.. so these people think that tony's wife never listened to him?  that tony didn't have a therapist, or that he didn't take medication?  that he didn't have thousands of hardcore fans, each of them willing to listen to every problem or concern that crossed his mind?  they must think that none of these things were true to suggest that calling some random person who knew nothing about his issues or personal struggles could have magically talked him out of something he has probably been contemplating for a good majority of his life.

imagine if you had a car that broke down.  imagine further that your significant other is handy with a car took a look at it, but was unable to fix the issue.  so then you go to a real mechanic and they look at your car and do what they can to get it running, but it is still having issues despite taking it back to them weekly and paying out the ass.  then imagine that someone tells you not to sell the car but to instead call a mechanic hotline and that they will fix all your problems over the phone by asking you minimal questions and telling you that everything is ok with your car. 

what that analogy doesn't capture though is the absolute weight of that car being broken down, or how long that car has been causing problems.  i am 36 this week; i have had suicidal thoughts since i was 7 or 8.  that is 28-29 years of baggage.  baggage that stuck with me when i had a lot of friends, baggage that i carry to a therapist, baggage that i carried through a happy marriage, baggage that i carry when i am with my daughter, baggage that i medicate.  baggage that is so heavy and integral to my being to expect a random person to somehow come along and pick it up for me would be absurd.

this isn't me saying don't call the number if you are hurting.  i am not saying that it is a useless thing that shouldn't exist.  what i am saying is that just quoting it willy nilly to people who are hurting is a kin to trying to save someone who fell off a boat by just tossing the life saver ring out into the water and not holding onto the rope to pull the person back on deck.  maybe you gave them a little more time or a little break, but you sure as shit didn't rescue them.

"i'm 32 and just lost my virginity!. edit: yes i have had lonely island stuck in my head for a full day now bahaha 

i can't believe it happened. i never thought it would, let alone that i would be comfortable enough with someone to actually have sex with them.

it was just natural and comfortable and all my fears and negative build-up in my head about sex just disappeared instantly and it was just really awesome.

i can't stop smiling.

it doesn't even feel real.

just..wow. everything feels just so..surreal. but in a good way.

and i just needed to share this and let it out. :d

"two women changed my life and they don't even know i exist. these two ladies profoundly impacted my life and i will never be able to thank them personally, so i will do it here.

first, to the random teenage girl on the train:

you were talking with your friend. she seemed really depressed because she could not get a boyfriend. i was half listening to the conversation while dozing off and heard you say:

""why do you want a boyfriend so much? what do you think will change in your life after getting a boyfriend?""

that woke me up. at the time, i was obsessing over getting a particular ""dream job"". i was depressed and anxious about it, i was crying over it. i was feeling like such a failure. it was all i could think or talk (and complain) about.

as soon as i got home, i made a list: ""things that i think will change if i get my dream job"".

it ended up being such a long list. i was basically blaming all of life's problems, big and small on not having this particular job. not only that, but i was also putting things ""on hold""' until after i got this job for no good reason. like i needed a particular job title to join a gym or practice my hobby.

so i took that list and started doing everything i wrote down. i started addressing the problems directly and finding outlets for the things i was not satisfied with. i still wanted the job, but my happiness did not depend on it. since then, when i find myself obsessing over a particular thing, i always take the time to think if i'm using it as an excuse to not work on other problems i might have.

thank you, teenage girl on the train. you were trying to help your friend and changed a stranger's life instead.

second, to the woman that lives in an apartment somewhere above me:

you moved to the building shortly after i did. i heard some people move what sounded like a very heavy object up the stairs and you thanking them with such happiness in your voice. and then i heard music. you almost didn't wait for the movers to leave before you started playing that piano. and you kept playing. every day.

every day i heard the piano and i remember thinking ""she plays beautifully, i wish i was that good at my hobby"". and then i felt like an idiot. because i was hearing you play every day while i was wasting time online. so i closed my laptop and got practicing.

i'm trying to build that habit now. sometimes it's hard to find that motivation, sometimes i forget. but every day i hear you play, and every time i stop what i'm doing and practice for a little bit. i'm still not great, but i'm getting better.

thank you, lady who lives in my building. you are just practicing a skill you enjoy and you inspired a stranger to do the same.",11
"i hired a cleaning service and living in a clean home has lowered my depression 95 percent.. for many reasons, including hoarder parents and an abusive childhood, i'm extremely messy. twice in my adult life i (m52) have been threatened with eviction by landlords for being so messy.

my wife and i separated last summer and my place has gone downhill since then. it's such a draining feeling to see a messy living room and kitchen. i can't ever get motivated enough to do it and then it becomes overwhelming to even try once it gets bad.

i hired a cleaning service awhile back and just had my second monthly appointment. my kitchen bathroom and living room are clean. i now can have guests over. i can cook food.

my mood has lifted. it makes me so happy to sit in a clean living room and to use a clean bathroom.

i was here yesterday when the cleaning woman came and she was very cool and nonjudgmental. she said she has adhd and ocd and it helps her with her issues to be able to help people and get paid too.

now my goal is to keep it tidy. i'm cleaning things as they get dirty and not putting it off.

it's like any other psychological issue. unless you have it, it seems like a minor thing but it cripples me emotionally to be this messy

please wish me success at turning this around.

edit: i am overwhelmed by the positive response to this post. i appreciate the kindnesses shown me. to clarify: yes, being messy is nobody's fault but mine. therapy taught me it is tied in with the abuse i suffered as a child but therapy hasn't yet fixed my messiness. when i was living with my wife, we shared the responsibility for chores and i did all the laundry and dishes. we didn't separate over cleanliness issues but rather a combination of other factors.
yes, i should have broken out of these patterns long ago. i've tried. i'm filled with shame and self-loathing over it. but i feel i've gotten a new lease on life and can only go on from here.

"my mother passed away from lung cancer 10 years ago. my dad just told me something about her that is just as terrible as her diagnosis.. a little background about me, i just turned 30 this past may, i just bought a house with my fiancee, of whom i proposed to on the day we closed on the house as a way to symbolically seal our relationship for good. it was a beautiful day, and to say i'm fortunate just isn't truly enough to describe it.

my family is small, but we're very tight knit as of late. my fiancee's family is massive and a little rambunctious. so in that, we find many differences. one of the key differences is that my family doesn't stay apart for very long. we try to interact often despite our busy schedules, and we're very open to each other, within reason.

i thought i knew everything about my mother. my mom and dad, my little brother and i lived a happy life together, my sister is 6 years older than me and she became independent quickly, so i didn't see her very often growing up. so us 4 lived like any normal family for many years, until near the end of my time in high school, when my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer.

she smoked cigarettes constantly. a pack a day, maybe more. for pretty much my whole life. and it didn't stop even when she was diagnosed. i was furious with her, but she was my mother. what could i have done?

she was too weak to see me graduate, and slowly withered away in a hospital bed at home. one night, my dad told me and my brother that her time was nearing its end, and he told us that it would be best to say goodbye to her. that night, we did. it was very anti climactic, almost as though we were totally prepared for it. i must have been, because a few nights later, it happened.

around 3-4 am, she died in my father's arms. my brother cried, but i didn't. i think i had made peace, but i still felt this depth that i never had before, i felt alone, because she was my best friend.

flash forward some 10 odd years and my dad is standing with me and my fiancee in our new kitchen, he tells us how proud he is of me and how well we've done as a couple, praising us left and right. this is a big deal to me because i've felt underwhelming as a son, as well as an older brother. as he's about to leave he stops and says ""you know, i wasn't sure if i should have this conversation with you and jake (little brother), but it just feels right at the moment. you and your future wife are off to a great start with your lives, and i figured i'd give you some insight on what it is to be married, to be there for your wife.""

he proceeded to tell me that, through most of his relationship with my mother, she struggled with an addiction to heroin. dad would find things missing from time to time, including money from his account, and knew that she was using just from looking at her. it went on for 15 years, and came to a head one night where she told my dad she didn't love him anymore, screaming at him to leave. he almost did, as he was about to walk out she stopped him, and begged him to stay. she apologized up and down, and from what he said, she detoxed in their bedroom, all on her own, over the course of a few days. he said after that it was like they fell in love all over again, that they hadn't been that happy since they met.

it would've been a beautiful ending, but then, cancer happened. we were on vacation in disney world, and she was weak. she barely participated with us, and once we got home, she went to the hospital, and was diagnosed right then. a year or so later, she passed.

i've never smoked, drank, or taken any hard drug in my life, and her cancer was the cause of it. knowing what else she went through has only further cemented my foundation.

thank you for reading, hopefully none of you have to endure something like this, reach out if this is happening to you, i'm sure someone will listen.",11

"i complimented a girl today.. she was eating strawberries in class. once she finished, she smiled and asked if i could spot any seeds in her teeth. i froze for a few seconds, then, after stumbling over my words, i managed to say, ""you have pretty teeth.""  yes, eventually i did actually answer the question, but it was only an afterthought. it ended with her smiling but not because she was concerned about her teeth. just to clarify, i'm an adult. downvote me all you want, i'm proud.",11

"my boyfriend cried in my arms. my boyfriends is pretty masculine, wears a beard and is pretty buff and not the kind of guy that is super into cozy stuff. 

so one night we took a bath together and i sat behind him and started washing him. he was  a bit  defensive at first but started to relax after some time. i massaged his head and washed his hair, kissed his neck. we didn't had sex or something i just felt that he needed some love and some body contact. after the bath we didn't talk we just kind of communicated without words. we went to the bedroom and we laid down. he laid his head on my chest and i put my arm around him. after sometime i grabbed a book from my nightstand and started reading to him while stroking his hair with my fingers. after some time i noticed that he was crying. i didn't say anything just put the book aside and hugged him really tight and kissed his forehead. he just said a really quite ""thank you"" and fell asleep on my chest. 

i just wanted to share and tell you guys because i think that doesn't matter how ""manly"" a guy is or how thug he acts they are all just humans after all and need love and care too. we do this now at least once every 2 weeks and he really loves it and our relationship was never so intimit and loving. 

edit : 

sorry for using ""after some time"" so often. english is my second language and pretty much self thought.

"i thought my dad called today. he passed away may 9, 2019.. my stepmother called today to wrap up some things after my father's passing last month. she called from the home phone, which i have in my contacts as ""dad"". when i saw the call, i immediately got excited to talk to him, then i realized that it wasn't my dad, and it never will be again. it hit me hard today that he is gone.",11
"if you tell people that are going to therapy that therapy is worthless. you're scum. it takes a lot to go to therapy, and it takes even more to tell people. to hear ""therapy is worthless it's just talking"" that sucks, specially when you don't know my life 

fuck you",11

"my boyfriend asked me to marry him and i haven't stopped crying since. i have never met anyone funnier, or more caring, than my boyfriend. i am so, so excited to be sharing this man's last name, household, future. 

i can't believe this is happening! every time i catch myself just having normal thoughts or doing day-to-day things, i start crying because i can't believe how lucky i am to be marrying my best friend soon. 

i can't believe he's choosing to spend the rest of his life with me. so, so blessed. ❤️",11
"i stole a lot of money from my parents as a teen, and now i am slowly slipping money into thier belongings to repay them.. when i was a teenager, i was pretty broke like most other teenagers. my family was a bit poor for a while, and in order to support my habits and wants, i would take small bills out of my parents' wallets. never more than i needed, but it surely stacked up over time. i know that they pwe're aware of money going missing from time to time but i was never confronted. i grew up and moved out when i was 20. 

7 years later and i have moved back in with them for the time being until i can get an apartment with my girlfriend. i've changed over the years and regret my past thieving ways. they allow me to drive thier cars from time to time (like today since my truck broke down). they leave their wallets and purse out in the living room. i have been taking cash out every payday, which is every friday, and slipping $20s into their center consoles, sun visors, wallets, and my mom's purse when i can afford to do so. i don't know if they have noticed, but i am going to continue to do so. i have to repay them for the money i took for my own selfish reasons. on top of that, even though they have not asked rent of me, i have been giving them 'rent' money to help atone as well. 

i just hope i can replace what i have taken from them in time.

(ps, i'm a lady)",11
"sure isn't a yes. when hooking up with a friend last weekend, he asked me about sex and i initially didn't give him a straight forward answer. flash forward an hour he brought it up again and i proceeded to say ""sure"". this boy looked me and said ""sure isn't a yes. be clear, it's okay if you don't want to"". thank you for being aware, you're a good guy.

edit#1: thank you to those with kind comments! i just want to say that the reason he asked for a more enthusiastic answer was because my tone was off. 


edit #2: i said sure due to us being friends.  yes, i agree that i needed to be more direct. on one hand, i wanted to, but i was also contemplating what was going to happen to our friendship.

edit #3: whether it ended up happening or not is between us. i understand the interest but the post is focused on consent! thank you!!",11
"today i showered. this is not a big thing for the majority of people, but to me, it's huge. 

i've struggled a lot with mental health in the past and i could feel myself slipping back into a deep dark hole. it's been two weeks since i last showered. 
i've taken time off work because i just couldn't face going in and pretending everything is okay. 

a lot of people won't understand this, but when you're going through it it really is a big deal to do mundane everyday things such as shower or brush your teeth. 

i don't want to go back into the dark place. today i have showered and i'm trying to force myself to go the gym. 

wish me luck.",11
"to the random girl who stopped and made sure i was safe when my boyfriend shoved me, thank you.. you were quiet when you asked if i was safe, because he was right behind me after having just thrown me to the ground. i had mascara tears running down my face. i looked up in shocked when you asked me, because for the first time, i realized that this was not normal. this was not okay. this wasn't a one time thing, just like the other times weren't a one time thing. thank you for helping me realize that i don't deserve this. thank you for the genuinely concerned look in your eyes, because now i know. thank you, kind stranger. i haven't taken any action yet, but awareness is the first step, right?

&#x200b;

edit: update: we broke up. it is taking everything within me not to crawl back to him. i feel alone and heartbroken.  i miss him. but you were all right - he was abusing me, and it wasn't going to stop anytime soon. no more excuses for him. without you all, i would have married this abusive boyfriend.",11
"i let a man come over tonight. he didn't have a condom, so i told him we could still hook up, just no piv stuff. he wasn't gracious.. he brought it back up at every turn. saying he wanted to be inside me, asking me to let him, etc. probably about 6 times and i kept saying ""yeah dude, you don't have a condom. not happening."" i was going down on him trying to finish him when he pulled me on him and tried to put himself in me unprotected and i finally just jumped off of him and told him to get the fuck out of my place. 

he got really fucking defensive. he was like don't be like this, blah blah. and i was like dude i had to tell you at least 5 times that penetration was off the table completely and you literally just tried to penetrate me. and he was just like "" i didn't penetrate u tho. u said no and i stopped"" and i was like yeah i also said no more than enough times before having to fucking yell that for you to know. as a grown ass man that shit is unacceptable . that's more than enough for me to not want you in my fucking house.  

i hate this. i can't stop crying. 

edit: wow, i can't thank you guys enough for your kindness and support. after i made this post i calmed down a bit and went to sleep and waking up to this was so wonderful. thank you so, so much. i hate how many of us have had experiences just like this. sometimes we kick him out, sometimes we don't, and in either case it isn't our fucking fault it happened. i am so proud of each of you and your resilience in the face of such awful circumstances. keep fighting, and remember you deserve just as much support from yourself as you've offered me. i love you guys <3

"left my abusive wife and reported her to the police. now everyone hates me. my wife cheated on me at least 3 times. she berrated me, hurts me, yells at me for the smallest mistakes. 

the last incident was when i caught her sending nudes to some guy and she chased me with a knife. i caught her on video assaulting me while trying to leave and i had reported to the police. 

i files for an emergency protection order as advised by family violence support program. i included my kids in the order.  now she might have criminal charges bought up against her but unlikely i think. 

most our friends sided with her and they post pictures together showing how happy they are. most people we know either believes she is the victim and im the abuser while people who believes me thinks that reporting to the police is a bit too harsh, specially the part where i included the kids in the protection order. 

she had started telling everyone that i had been besting her up over the years hence the reason for her actions and people believe it more than my video evidence, texts, etc. 

if gender were reverse im sure people would be more supportive of me. unfortunately i feel like she wins no matter how hard i fight for the truth. 

i feel lonely, and i feel like i was the one who made a mistake. i never hurt her or even emotionally abused her. yet someone how i'm the one who ends up alone and labeled a bad guy. i

i just want to sleep and pretend this is all a dream.",11
"i let an abused child go home with her abuser. i'm a teacher and i love my job. it's the best job but sometimes it takes a toll. yesterday one of my students came back for the first time since the week prior. she has spotty attendance. she also has lice that has been untreated since the start of the school year.  i was excited she was back but annoyed at her constant absences. 

when she came in, she had ink on her hand. i didn't think much of it. later i realized it was bruising and not ink. i took her to the nurse where she said she had extensive bruising on both thighs as well. she said she was beaten by her mother. it took everything in me not to fall apart in front of her. just watching her curl into a ball while telling us and admitting she was afraid to tell because she didn't want to get taken away again. she said she was worried she would be in trouble for telling. 

i called cps and waited on hold for 45 minutes. when i finally got through, the woman taking the report didn't know what lice was and wasn't familiar with the common household item that was used to hit her. after an hour and a half of hold time and reporting, they said they weren't going to come out today! how?

they must have called the family to say they wanted to see the kid because the mom came to pick her up early. i asked my admin if there was anything we could do and the answer was no. we had done the most we could without committing kidnapping. it broke a little bit of my soul to send her home. 

i'm waiting for my kids to come in right now. they will be at my door in 2 minutes and hope that she's here today. i am not confident she will be. i know they've run away with the kids to other states before to avoid charges of neglect. i also hope that if she comes back she will still trust me and the other staff. 

update: she isn't here nor is the other child. i had not considered calling the police but will on my lunch and will update! thank you for the advice. it's hard to consider the other options when you are told there aren't any. 

update 2: i called cps again and requested a call back for an update but couldn't get through to a real person. hopefully i'll here back soon. i also called the police and asked to check on the welfare. the problem is that the address we have on file is incorrect and i know they live in another city but have this one on record for the school. i don't know their other address. the police are going to her address on file and then will proceed from there. alas, nothing is simple or speedy. 

update 3: i just heard from the school nurse. a social worker was in touch but they deferred to the police. the police caught them trying to flee. they did end up getting them and the student is being evaluated at the hospital and she is being removed from the home!!!!!!!  i'm so happy they found her before they got away. the family is trying all sorts of things to try and confuse the police about what happened, but it will work out.

minor update 4: i told my assistant principal about the call i made just so she wasn't blind sided by it and she was happy i called. i was worried she would be mad that i went around the system but she wasn't. also, she can stay at our school technically. being removed from her house means she is homeless and she is allowed to remain at our school even though she is out of district. it's a little victory that i hope her temporary housing family will help to maintain for her.

"i have been living in poverty for years now. i almost committed suicide a few months ago. i just got an inheritance from my grandmother of nearly 800,000 dollars..  

i  made a lot of mistakes growing up. my parents were drug addicts, and i  did a lot of drugs (not heroin like they did) and alcohol growing up. i  also grew up in a horrendous, violent neighborhood. i struggled with  ptsd from being exposed to so much violence there at a young age,  shootings, beatings, everything imaginable.

at  17, i got a girl pregnant. i tried to be a good father, i really did,  but as the years went by it was just so difficult to provide for them  financially. i spent my entire 20s literally up my ass in bills, paying  for healthcare, rent, childcare etc. me and chelsea (my kids mom) never  got married but we lived in the same apartment building so we basically  were still mom and dad, even though we never actually really were in a  relationship, we still were together, a lot. then she got pregnant  again, by me, when i was 27 years old. i was sort of able to provide  before then, we were poor but not too poor, but after the second kid? it  was just too much. i was scrapping by for literally any money i could  possibly find. i was working 70+ hours a week at low wage jobs. i was  content with my first child, i loved him, but at the same time i wanted  my life to actually begin when he turned 18 and went to college and  such. now a second child? another 18 years of me working to death to  support them? i love my daughter more than anything but i was  distraught, basically suicidal for years after she was born. i was 27  years old, i would be 'free' and finally be able to live my own life and  go to college and get a good career... by 45 years old. the thought of  it was so horrible to even imagine, it felt like i was in a prison.

when  i was 29 years old, i ended up nearly killing myself because of the  stress. not just the work, but everything, i was mentally destroyed.  every single day was like torment. i recovered, but not really by much.

a  year has passed by since i almost committed suicide. my grandmother  died. i never knew her, at all. i knew that she lived in nyc and that  she was a russian jewish immigrant. my mom ran away from her when she  was 19 years old so i never really met her except twice in my life.

turns  out my grandmother left me 773,000 dollars, and she also left me  countless items of inheritance. her apartment in the upper west side of  manhattan, a ton of gold and silver jewelry. when i found out, i just  could not stop crying.

i didn't even tell  my chelsea right away, instead i took our family to a surprise dinner  at a fancy restaurant. she was upset and confused as to how we were  getting the money to afford this, and then i told her and she just  couldn't even contain how happy she was.

its  been 3 months. dealing with the legal process of the apartment and the  inheritance is difficult, but we are dealing with it. we plan on taking  150k and putting it for the college fund of each of our kids, then  taking another 250k and putting it in savings, then we have the rest to  decide what to do with. buy a home most likely. then once we sell the  apartment (worth 1.5 million\~)... then i really don't know what the hell  is gonna happen. its so much money i almost don't even know what the  hell to do.

i am just blown away at this.  everything. it feels like i died and went to heaven. every time i think  about it i just start crying in happiness.",11
"i'm sick and tired of constantly being a target to men and i'm even more sick and tired that people see this as something that can't be changed or isn't worthwhile addressing. i understand this site is mostly men and that a good portion of those men probably won't truly understand how ridiculously prominent this is until they've walked in a female's shoes.

i make this post cause i got my first apartment and my dad literally came in and made sure it was ""pervert proofed"" as he called it. 

so like the awesome dad he is, he switched out my door screws and added an extra lock cause the original one isn't a deadbolt, this is standard and not unique to my situation of course. but then he started looking for *camera infrared* cause i guess male landlords will put cameras to spy on female tenants. he also checked for microphones as well. i was disgusted when i found out through my dad that one of his coworkers had gone through the court process cause her pervert landlord had been spying on her. disgusted..but not surprised.

let's continue with other ways i've had to ""pervert proof"" for the majority of my life.

at my old job, women weren't allowed to carry things to people's cars or trash to the dumpster alone. you had to use a buddy system. why? cause a chick at a bestbuy down the street had an attempted kidnapper when he asked her to help with a computer tower.

i cannot go to gas stations past 10pm. i don't go because 3 times now i've had very creepy and threatening experiences with guys trying to ""hit on me"" when really they're just belligerently telling me to ride with them. two of those times i've been threatened.

obviously in college there's a 101 ways women are advised to protect themselves. travel in groups, always watch your drink, don't go home alone, use a friend instead of an uber if possible and if you have to use uber make sure it's your driver and that you can jump out if he turns on you. etc etc.

in highschool my mom always told me to sit at the front of the city bus so that the driver can help me when a man inevitably creeps on me, threatens me, or flashes me. two of those things did happen within a year later. bonus points, she told me to always make sure i'm not being followed when i get off as well. thankfully i haven't been.

in middle school i started to get hit on when i hit puberty and this is when i faced the brunt of male perversion at *twelve* years old and had to learn techniques to dodge it which is despicable. 

now it's rubbed in my face now that girls are used as symbols of commodities for advertisement. what i mean by this is when girls my ages get their tits pushed out and are plastered next to whatever product that needs to be sold. there's a radio ad i hear constantly for a bar that says ""college girls go here"" as a form of advertisement and it's so gross and predatory. 

i hate it. i really do. i understand most male violence is on other guys, but women get the brunt of male perversion and it's terrible and needs to change. societal values have changed before and this isn't an exception. i know if we start frameshifting what is acceptable and normal that less people will do it. won't be gone forever but perhaps i wouldn't have to be constantly plagued by this scenario. 

obligatory ""not all men"" in case someone hasn't deduced that reading this. 

thank you for listening",11
"when he didn't show up to our halloween party, we didn't really think anything of it... (suicide trigger warning). then on friday we get a text saying that he died the day before. we saw him on wednesday on his way home to commit suicide. we were walking to class and said ""you're coming to the halloween party tomorrow, right?"" he laughs and says yes. we tell him he can crash on our couch, and he accepts. we chat a little more and he says life isn't going great. we tell him ""that sucks man, we're sorry."" but we had no idea. i didn't think anything of it, i mean we're in college, everything generally sucks right now. we had to get to class and we fist bump and part ways. we tell each other ""see you tomorrow."" that was the last time we saw him alive. we come to find out he went home, took one of his parent's guns, told his parents goodbye, pretending to go off to work, and went to a park and shot himself. 

the world is different now.

i hope you can at least finally rest easy now, camden. we love you and i'm sorry

"he blow dried my hair and i started to cry. my mental health is in a pretty bad state almost all the time. months go by where i struggle to do normal things like eating properly or sleeping at a reasonable time. i mostly stay awake till my eyes burn and my headache turns into a terrible migraine, until i finally allow myself to rest, just to feel kinda guilty when i wake up the next morning.  
in the past i got together with guys who just liked me for my looks and my body. when i broke up with my first boyfriend all that he told me was ""shit man, now i am still gonna be a virgin."" he constantly sent me messages with spam bots and called me, harassed my sister and in the end tried to fake a suicide, so i would get back with him out of pity. he started taking drugs that kept him awake so he could work more. he did everything possible to ruin himself, so that he could blame me. 
my second boyfriend lived 600 miles away, so we didn't see each other very often. he pushed me to send him nudes, because ""that's what all good girlfriends do."" he wanted me to get naked while we facetimed and when i did not do it, he pushed me into a fight and made me feel terrible. ""no one is going to love you with your dumb depressed mind"", were his last words before i blocked him everywhere. after that i had something going on with guys, that put a bet on me with their friends or who tried to sleep with me and then ignored me even though we saw each other every day in class. i felt terrible and started to harm myself, thought about the big question, if everything would get better if i just wouldn't be here anymore. after two years of just being at home and struggling with myself and my past i went back to college and in my last year i met my current boyfriend. he saw me when i walked to the train station after class in summer. ""where are you going? hop in, i'll drive you home."" everything started with that sentence. he constantly tried to make me happy, helped me with my problems. he was here for me. he bandaged my wounds, bought me food, was patiently waiting while i ate. i went on my first concert with him, had the best summer of my life and started loving myself a little bit. recently we had a kinda bad fight. we sat in bed and both cried while discussing our problem. i needed to shower, so he went with me, even though we were angry at each other. i was exhausted and fell in bed. after a short while he started to blow dry my hair, massaging my scalp. he kissed my head and told me how much he loved me and that we will work towards a solution. i instantly started to cry out of happiness. i never had experienced such a honest love and understanding. he stayed, we talked. no one screamed, there weren't any threats, just love and the need to solve it. i fell asleep and when i woke up again he was still there, rubbing my neck to make sure i feel comfortable. i think i found him.   i hope everyone finds someone like him.

"i cannot stand boomer work culture. i work at an office where i am, by quite a few years, one of the youngest people in the company. it is also relatively small, so i frequently see my boss's boss, and even work with them directly for some things. however, the other day, he saw me at my desk on my phone checking news and email, when i should have been ""working"". the problem was that it was literally 10 minutes before 5 (which is when i usually leave) and i had basically committed to staying an extra hour to handle an account who decided to work with us last minute. i was on my phone because i was simply waiting to hear back from this account so i could actually do some work. but my boss saw me on my phone, instead of twiddling my thumbs like a good 'ol boy and complained to my direct supervisor. and a few minutes later she pulled me into her office (when i actually had gotten word back from my account and was actually trying to get work done) to chastise me for not ""looking busy"" even though she knew i was working and was simply waiting on my client to respond. they decided to actually waste my time when i was actually busy to reprimand me for not looking busy for a measly 10 minute window even though both knew i was simply waiting to hear back from someone. their problem wasn't that i wasn't doing anything, it's that it ""looked bad"" that i was on my phone rather than staring at my computer monitor like some sort of mindless drone, waiting for an email to come in.

my bosses also frequently brag about how little they sleep and how few days off they get in a given year. it's pathetic, and i appreciate how people my age actually don't want to give their lives in full to their jobs and become wage slaves like our parents and grandparents. i'm in at 8 and out by 5, and i don't work weekends, period. yet my bosses get angry if i don't respond to redundant emails on my days off that have no reason why they can't wait until monday morning.",11
"so guys...my boyfriend lied to me again and i am jumping with joy!. so. 
he has lied and cheated multiples times. i was trying to trust him ...he said he wants to build my trust but i have been suspicious. then after many suspicious events, today he lied again. 100% lied. he had someone at his place and he wouldn't video call me for 19 minutes after a whispering call. 
so the reason i am joyful is that i am done ...i am free. no more him. 
i don't have time try and save a relationship in so much pain. he is a deceiver. and i can go back to my life. which is simple beautiful and just ok. 
he would be an amazing husband but what would i do with his pampering and affection and fun, if i never feel safe?

"i was finally able to let the mother of the boy whose murder i witnessed know her son didn't die alone. last fall, a young man was shot and killed on our sidewalk while my husband, our friend, and i were standing less than 30 feet away on the other side of a privacy fence.

it all happened so fast. a car pulled up on the road that runs by our backyard. someone got out. people were talking, there was no escalation in the conversation, no anger. it wasn't a fight. gunshots just started going off. a moment of silence, then the car sped off into the night.

my husband and our friend called 911 while i went to the fence and saw someone lying facedown on the sidewalk. i honestly thought he was dead at first, until he took a gasping breath. i crouched down next to him and gently rubbed his back. i started talking to him, even though he wasn't conscious, telling him he'd be okay. i stayed with him until i had to flag down the cop car and they began trying to save him.

he passed away shortly after. i don't know when. i just know the ambulance left in silence. we were interviewed by detectives that night and never heard anything else about it until last month when my husband and our friend got served subpoenas.

i have thought about that boy every day. i wondered what his family is like, what his laugh sounded like, i wanted to know his name. most of all, i wish i could let his mom know her boy didn't die alone on the sidewalk. i wrote her a letter the day after it happened and then i realized i had no way of getting it to her.

i didn't know any case details. i didn't even know his name. i couldn't find anything online. i couldn't find any obituary, news article, or police reports about the incident. i didn't know anyone involved. he was like a ghost to me. the only reason i knew it had actually happened for a long time was the bullet hole in our fence and the fact there were two other witnesses, though it was rarely discussed amongst ourselves.

the guys reported to court and my husband talked to one of the other witnesses. she was a friend of the kid and she made it clear her and the family didn't know much of the details as to what happened to him that night other than he was shot and left to die.

i got hammered drunk that night and wrote her a letter for my husband to give her the next day. i tried to keep it short and spared her any gory details. i just let her know i was by his side within seconds of the car fleeing and i was by his side until first responders got there and that he didn't spend his final moments alone.

i left it to her judgement as to whether the family, especially his mom, would want to know that. my husband saw her hand the letter to his mom shortly after she read it, so i feel reassured i made the right call.

my heart is broken, but i finally feel a bit more at peace about it. i don't know if knowing a stranger was there next to him will be any comfort to them, but i hope so.

i hope his mom gets in touch with me. i want to know more about her boy. i want to know his name. i want to see a picture of his smile. i want to give her a hug. i want her to know her son will never be forgotten. ",11
"i don't think anyone really cares but damn i fucking love my girlfriend. it's my birthday today and i was meant to got to sleep 3 hours ago because i'm doing stuff tomorrow (technically today) for my birthday but i'm still up because i got a notification saying ""your memories from 2 years ago today"" 

it was a photo of me and my girlfriend on my birthday 2 years ago when we had been together around 7 months and i've spent the last few hours crying looking through old photos and listening to all our favourite songs. say whatever you want about it, i don't care i fucking love that girl with my heart and she's the best thing that's ever happened to me. 

not sure if anyone cares and this will get buried over other posts but i just wanted to put it out there

i am 1 month sober from alcohol today. today marks the day that i (m19) am a month sober from alcohol. i have severe liver disease and my doctor told me that i have to stop drinking so that my liver can attempt to repair itself. i just went to the health services and got my blood drawn for tests. i will know in three days if my results improved or not. i know a month isn't long but it feels like a big accomplishment to me. i don't feel any different than when i was drinking. my friends and family don't seem to care so i thought i would type it out here.,11
"teaching can kiss my ass.. i 38/f am done. kids won't even take their earbuds out of their ears long enough to listen to the short lecture or instructions. i have sorely lost the war against cell phones. the entire time i'm talking, they're sneaking their phones. it doesn't matter how engaging or student-centered or interactive i make the lessons, they do not care. i have worked in three districts and i run into the same nonsense everywhere. 

i have to chase students down to even get the easiest assignments turned in. between missing work, chasing down absent students, having to reteach the lesson to tardy students...nothing productive is accomplished. i have been screamed at by parents because i gave their child a zero for printing his essay off the internet. i have been swung at, cursed at, flipped off, and sexually harassed. you name it, it's happened. i've cultivated great relationships with many of my kids, but i am still putting in zero after zero in the gradebook and begging them to put their phones away (admin doesn't support us taking them.) 

i teach high school and have kids in my class that cannot read or write a complete sentence. i have to modify everything for kids with ieps, leaving the high achieving kids unchallenged and bored. i am only one person, and the system is completely broken. 

the rewards of this job are so profoundly outweighed by the disrespect, poor pay, required overtime, student apathy, and utter emotional turmoil. i find myself wanting to drive off the side of the road rather than make it to school. i cant eat, sleep, relax. i have nothing left for my own three children or husband. i'm out.

edit: it is not the fault of students with ieps. it's the absurdity of the idea that teachers have to teach every level of learner at the same time.",11

if anyone has advice about a good field for a felon, please let me know.

i'm worried that everyone will be able to tell that i've been to prison, or that i've been deeply involved in my past with drugs. i've been clean for over 3 years now.

\*\*edit: thanks for all the positive messages! everyone has been great, i'm really surprised at the high response!

\*\* edit #2.  thanks again everyone. i'm driving all day but i will go through and read each reply this evening along with replying to many of you. thank you for the encouragement. it's really heart warming!!

***\*\*final edit:***   i am more optimistic about the future having interacted and spoken with many of you. i have read each of your comments (more than 300), i have saved many of your replies and words of encouragement so i can refer to them later. i feel that i have experienced the very best of the internet today. most people are so quick to brush past those with a background like mine. several of you sent me reddit ""gold"", and nearly all of you have touched my heart in a way that i needed right here at the start of my journey.

some of you are in my position, many of you have family and friends that have been in my position. people from every field of study and practice gave me advice in addition to others who sought out information just so they could share it in the comments.

reading your replies have kept me smiling all day long and will keep me motivated long into the future. never underestimate how even a short phrase of encouragement can impact even a total stranger. i've learned something from this post that i didn't intend. it doesn't matter what i do with my college education. the world has enough successful people. if i can muster an ounce of the compassion that was expressed towards me here for the benefit of others thats where the real ""gold"" is found.

thank you everyone.

"i wanted to kill myself today, but i decided to tell people how much i appreciate them instead. everyone i've had a positive interaction with. even if i only met them once, or if we haven't spoken in ages. anyone that came to mind, i messaged them and said thank you, and wished them happiness in the future and a great day today. i tried to add little stories that i remembered about hanging out with them if i had any.

i've always heard that when you feel like you have nothing, you should always try to remember the things you do have. so i spent 2 hours sending people (what is hopefully) a nice message for them to wake up to later today. i also couldn't stop thinking about people like me who paint a nice picture on social media but are actually pretty miserable in day-to-day life.

i actually really do feel better now after putting positivity in the world instead of negativity. i didn't self harm and i didn't try to end my life.

yeah the feeling of despair hasn't gone away, but now i can also remember that i'm not completely worthless, and i can still put beautiful things into the world too :)",11

"victims of rape should not be held financially responsible for any exams or evaluations. long story short, my friend was raped last night and she told me the hospital made her sign a waiver saying she was responsible for all charges. are you fucking kidding me? how the hell is that acceptable? all i want to do is find the coward that did it, beat his ass and drag him to hospital and have him pay. this is why rape is almost never reported. not only is there almost no evidence in most cases, but the system feels like it's working against the victims. i've never been so fucking mad.

i've never been to this sub but judging by the rules, my post might be removed because of my language.  i just need to vent this frustration.

edit: you guys have been really helpful and kind. i'll sit down with her later and go through some of these suggestions. thank you again.

edit 2: i gave her the link to this post since you guys were so incredibly helpful. i wanted to show the support you all brought. she was handed some sort of victim's compensation form to fill out and she said some random lady was at the hospital with a stuffed bear for her but disappeared. i don't know if this was rva but if it wasn't, she will follow up with them as well. thanks guys.

"i left the hospital without my baby today. adoption.. my beautiful baby girl was born on may 4th. she is very healthy, has a head full of hair that's the exact same color as the dads, and she's so calm. 

i gave birth with the adoptive parents and my mom and boyfriend in the room. we all gave her lots of snuggles, and i breastfed her for the two days we stayed at the hospital. 

this afternoon i was discharged and had to say goodbye. i breastfed her one last time before i left, and just have her lots of kisses. another baby was born as i was leaving the hospital so that made me smile for the family and the nervous looking dad. 

i've been at home now just cuddling with my boyfriend as we process and deal with this. it's gonna be a long road, and my recovery kinda sucks right now it's defiantly kicking my butt. i'm so sore and tired.

"i have to choose whether to end my sister's life.. my sister and i grew up in a very broken home. our dad was never around and my mom was an alcoholic who couldn't hold a job. when i got to be about 15, i started work to make sure my little sister could eat every night. i went to school and worked night shifts at the local market to provide for her. i eventually dropped out of school to work full time so she and i could move out. she's currently 11, and i'm 20. at the age of 18, i decided to fight for custody of my sister so she and i could leave my very absent mother. our mother immediately signed custody over and seemed relieved. 

she and i got an apartment and now we're much happier. we don't worry about the gas going out or not having electricity. my mom frequently brought men over to sleep with for money, and i lied awake every night making sure they didn't try to touch my sister. we had mold and other problems, and my sister developed asthma. 

she's kept it controlled, but certain things trigger her asthma and send her into coughing fits. i've taken her to the er when it's bad off. 

two weeks ago, i got a call at work. it was the local hospital telling me my sister had been found unconscious, without a pulse, in the school bathroom. they called 911 and began cpr, and continued en route to the hospital. they successfully got a pulse, but she remained unconscious and has since been intubated. 

she's had numerous mris and scans, and they all say the same- she was without oxygen for 8 minutes, and she has no brain activity. she's not brain dead, but she isn't awake. she's in a vegetative state and likely won't come out of it. 

since i have full custody of her, i have to choose whether or not to retract her life support and let her go. she's been my world and i can't even focus at home because she's gone and her laugh doesn't fill the house. i don't know what to do without her. i'm holding onto the small sliver of hope, but i can't be selfish. i don't want to let her go, but she shouldn't be held here because of my selfish desire.",11
"i was raped by a girl and everyone thinks it's funny. tl:dr got raped by a girl at university, everyone just brushes it off and thinks it's funny and/or that guys can't be raped

to give some context: i'm a male, college student, 21 years old. this happened about a year ago.

i'm at the club nearing the end of a night when a familiar girl comes up to me and tells me she lost her keys, all her friends went home already and aren't replying and she's way to drunk to sleep on the street. since we've met before and i'm close to some of her friends i suggest to her that she can sleep in my bed and i would sleep on the floor. i just figured it would be easier than trying to contact her flatmates.

we go back to mine, mind you i'm pretty drunk at this point but still functioning, i tell her to sleep on the bed and i'll have the floor. she tells me i can sleep in the bed that she doesn't mind. i have a king size bed so i agree, i go one of the ends of the bed turn around and fall asleep.

in the morning, i kindly ask her to leave when i wake up and even call her a cab. as soon as she has left i go to the bathroom and that's when i see myself in the mirror. hickeys all over my neck, chest and abs. at this point i'm very confused, cause i had not gotten with anyone that night. i remember going to sleep very clearly even though i was drunk, i wasn't black out. i look around my room and i find a condom wrapper open, i didn't find any used condom though (she took it? possibly to hide it?).

i call one of her friends the next day, after i slept over it and processed what happened and he tells me she told her best friend we had sex. that shook me. 

for about 6 months i wasn't able to have one night stands, i wouldn't trust a girl i didn't know to be around me. even know a year later i still find it very hard and whenever i do end up having sex it's always with someone i built some rapport with and am very comfortable around. which is a complete turn around of who i was before that event. i was completely broken, i used to cry myself to sleep some nights, i've never felt so gross. eventually i started getting better, that is until now...

i finally told my friends about what happened and why i had that sudden chance of personality. they laughed at me. i got comments telling me i'm a guy so i can't be raped, comments saying ""so what?"" as if the fact that it ended in sex and i should be thankful for. and even to people straight up stop being my friends because they were friends with her. i never confronted her because i cut her off my life and wherever she goes i just can't be around. 

i just needed to get this out! i cut all those people that reacted that way out of my life, and i hope i made the right decision, it made me lonely right now but it's definitely better than being around people who belittle this situation that fucked me up so much.

edit: the response here has been overwhelming good! i'm so glad i decided to post here, everyone is been so supportive. thank you so much, i wish i had the time to reply to each of you individually and say thanks. i've booked an appointment with a therapist to talk about it since it seems like a great idea. again, thank you! it means a lot me.",11

"i (m15) just got adopted (on halloween). so for background info, i until was a foster child for two years until i got adopted today. all of my life i was abused, neglected and surrounded by drugs. i still have scars and burn marks on my back from the abuse. my father left me when i was six months old, and got bullied all my life. and at one point i tried ending my life because it was getting too horrible. at that point i was pulled out of the homeless shelter i was staying in, and put into foster care. since then, i joined the cross country team in high school, and track, and playing flute for the band. i went from failing every single class to straight a's. also recently, as of nine months ago i got a boyfriend. the case finally close today, i completed all of my goals for therapy, and am currently working on basic skills such as cooking (scary). and coincidentally on halloween i just got adopted. this is the closest to a caring family i have ever gotten. and my amazing boyfriend is so supportive of me, and i am happier than i have ever been. i didn't think my life would get better but i was proven wrong.

you see. there are things about her blindness that are so adorable, funny and cute. every time we are in the same room i gently reach for her hand or touch her shoulders so she knows i'm in the same room and i see her face brighten up every single time. 

supporting her blindness, and serving her as a partner and now husband makes me so happy. it's become such a pleasure and joy that if she became a sighted person, while i would be happy for her, part of me would wish to go back.

"what my sister will never know. tonight was probably the worst st. patrick's day i've had yet. i was the dd for my younger sister 21f and her friends. we had plans to go to this club in detroit. before we went to the club we stopped at her friends apartment so they could pre-game. my sister was driving at the time because she was sober still and ended up parking in someone's reserved spot.

fast forward an hour or so one of her friends gets sloppy drunk and is throwing up outside. i go to check on him and notice my sisters car wasnt there, so i go inside and tell her. turns out her car had gotten towed by the people who the parking space belonged to. so we all pile into one of her friends car and drive to the tow lot. 

they ended up charging her 380 dollars for her to get her car back. the whole time she is sobbing in the back because she didn't have the money. by this time the night was pretty much ruined so we asked her friend to give us a ride home. 

on the way home she is trying to figure out how to pay the money to get her car, and one of her friends dad (who is trying to sleep with her btw) tells her he'll pay for it, in exchange for a date. once we get home she tells me she is going to do it and i finally talked her out of it because that's... well that's something i never want my little sister to have to ever resort to. 

we moved some money around and finally figured out what to do, so i drove her back to get her car. we split ways and are going to meet at mcdonald's to get some food to make us feel better. while i'm sitting in the mcdonald's parking lot waiting for her i get a phone call from her that she was pulled over and blew a ,074 which is .006 below the legal limit. so she luckily doesn't get a dui, but i have to come pick her up because the cop wasn't going to let her drive her car home.

we had to ditch her car in a liquor store parking lot, and the cop tells us that if we don't move the car before 7 am the owner will tow it. he gives her a ticket for speeding and then send us on our way. 

by this point my sister has probably had the worst night of her life and hits a low that i havent seen her hit in a long time. she used to cut herself and i knew it was on her mind. i assured her that i would get her car back and not to worry. she didn't want to tell our mom because she'd flip, so i told her i'd figure it out. 

i sat up with her until she fell asleep to make sure she didn't cut, and then bundled up and walked around 8 miles to get her car from the liquor store. she will never know that i walked that far to get her car back. and i don't want her to. tonight was horrible for her and i just couldn't bare it getting any worse. sorry this is such a long post, but i just needed to get tonight off my chest. 


edit: thank you so much for the support! family always comes first in my eyes, and i'd do anything for them. i'm sure she would have done the same for me. and i'm her brother, i forgot to identify my gender in there. oops ! 

edit: also as some of you pointed out she was driving under the influence, which i feel like was partly my fault because i let her take her car home, we had to get it that night tho or the price was going to keep going up. still inexcusable and i don't have much sympathy for her receiving a ticket or anything either. but i couldn't let her get her car towed twice 🤷🏼‍♂️",11

"i saw a stranger with a blanket i made yesterday. last year i was able to do a nice thing for some community members. i was homeless and made a poor flipping decision on polar fleece (flipping - buying and selling as side income). essentially, shipping costs would have killed any margin and local wasn't working.

so i took the downtime i had at a night job and made double fleece no sew tie blankets and handed them out to fellow homeless people after shift one morning at a food pantry when the frosts were hitting.

it was a brief experience but positive. i made about two dozens people's mornings with a clean new blanket while waiting in the cold.

yesterday, around a year later i saw a homeless person walking down the street with one of those blankets. the fabric choice, my poor technique, all of it. i'm sure i've never seen this person before so that blanket went on a journey and is still providing comfort to someone.

i'm not homeless anymore, but times are hard, and seeing that really brightened my day. i just wish i had some more fleece now.",11
"to the girl who was horribly bullied and abused in high school. i still think about you and i am so sorry.. this was back in the mid 80s, my high school years were straight out of a john hughes movie. i have so many happy memories but every once in a while i am plagued by memories of sarah. this will be very long, i have a lot to get out. **the tl;dr is that i had a friend who vicariously lived her life through me because she was being abused in every way at home and at school. i am wracked by guilt still decades later about what more i could have done.**

abuse, sexual assault and suicidal trigger warnings.

i met sarah on the first day of freshman year. she was the tallest girl i had ever seen.  she was slim, freckled and had a head full of corkscrew curls, bright orange-red, that fell down passed her shoulders. everyone snickered and whispered. but i said ""wow, i love your hair, so pretty!"" and went up and touched one of the springy curls. sarah slightly recoiled and blushed bright red but then burst into a huge smile and said ""thanks."" i said ""very choice"" and sat down. she took the seat behind me, that was how i met the girl who i haven't been able to stop thinking about 31 years later.

sarah didn't dress like my friends and i. or like any of the cliques in school. i was this post punk pre goth who was lucky enough to be alive when that music was in its heyday. my basic ""uniform"" was docs, knee socks, short skirt, band shirt and a bomber jacket. sarah always thought everything i wore was the most amazingly cool article of clothing she had ever seen. when in reality i looked like every one of my girl friends and actually my guy friends too, just exchange the skirt for some tight black pants. 

she was bullied for her clothes, height, hair, shyness - but i liked her. as she opened up she was a really sweet, cool girl. 

i started to wonder why sarah never dressed like us since she seemed to love it so much. then i started to notice that *she too* almost wore the same thing everyday. the same khaki pants or acid washed jeans. the same three shirts. same penny loafers. same windbreaker, no makeup or nail polish. the same earrings that were used to pierce her ears. i realized her family must not have much money. my little group got a lot of our things at thrift stores so i invited her to go with us one day after school. she said she couldn't and i said okay maybe some other time and she said yea maybe ... pretty unconvincingly. when i walked back over to my friends they had a lot of rude things say about her. i was a teenage girl ... so i am pretty ashamed to admit that i said ""yea she is pretty weird.""

she loved looking at my brother's picture, handsome in his uniform. she asked me all about him. i think she developed a safe little crush on him. one day she asked who ""bauhaus"" was because the name was artfully scribbled on my pee chee folder. i gave her a mixtape of all my favorite bands and songs and a walkman. she wore those headphones everywhere. bauhaus became her favorite.

i never ever saw her during lunch or any school events or at the mall where basically the entire school went every weekend. she never went to any parties. she always had an excuse when i asked her to do something outside of school. i only ever saw her in our shared classes or the halls with those headphones on. so sophomore year when she asked me to her birthday sleepover i was shocked but let her know that of course i would be there. i finally learned why she was ""pretty weird"". 

she lived in a very typical split level 80s house. nice car in the driveway. her typical 80s mom answered the door. sarah introduced me to her step dad, a short and plump soft looking man who appeared much older than her mother. she had two half siblings. adorable little spoiled brats. her dad looked me up and down like i was dangerous, but there was something foreign and equally as dangerous in his slight smile.

""you have your ears pierced ... twice."" and then he gave a knowing look to sarah's mom. 

she said to me, ""your parents allowed that?"" 

""yes, mrs. duncan my mom helped me do it."" 

""don't call me that, that is *her dads* name"" 

""oh i'm so ..."" 

her step dad cut me off.""you did them yourself?"" before i could answer he stepped forward and slipped his hands in my jacket looking at my t-shirt, ""what does your shirt say?"" 

""the cure uh mr....""

""randall"" 

""the cure, mr. randall, its a band"" 

""hmmm, we don't listen to that nonsense music here."" 

i realized then that to sarah's parents i *was* dangerous. i was a typical 80's teenager. 

sarah's birthday party was just her family and myself. which included her mentally disabled aunt that sarah shared a room with. her aunt rocked and stared and made a low moaning sound until she would point and grunt at something she wanted. later that evening she pointed at a button on my jacket that was hanging on a chair, sarah's mom removed it and handed it to her and never said a word to me.

during dinner her little siblings treated sarah horribly. her parents treated her like she wasn't there. i did my best to be polite, talk to sarah and wonder if i could get out of sleeping over. i wish i had. i was expected to share a queen size canopy bed with sarah and her aunt. 

during the night i got up, grabbed my makeup bag, my clothes and sarah's hand. we went downstairs to a bathroom and she was both giddy and terrified when i started putting makeup on her. she began asking me all the questions. had i ever kissed a boy? how far had i gone? what did my bedroom look like? could i use my car outside of school? what was my mom like? on and on. i had never heard her talk so much.

i answered all her questions, dressed her head to toe and then turned her towards the mirror. she actually gasped. i think for a moment she didn't believe she was seeing herself. i told her again how pretty her hair was and how i wished i had red hair like hers. i said ""you must look like your dad"" since she looked nothing like her family. she teared up and said that she didn't know she had never seen him. i didn't know what to say with my foot in my mouth and all but then the dam broke.

she told me how her mother hated her and would always tell her she was just like her father. how her siblings got everything and she had to beg for anything. how when she got home from school she had to sit at the dining room table so they could keep an eye on her until bed time. she was never ever allowed to go anywhere without a parent. sarah was born when her mother was 15 and she was being punished for it. i just listened. it was horrible, mentally, physically and emotionally abusive. i hugged sarah for a really long time and she cried like she had never been allowed to cry before.

i told her she could keep my clothes and my makeup bag. she looked like she wanted to say yes but she reluctantly took it all off. we started to sneak back upstairs when her stepdad stopped us. sarah was paralyzed with fear and i was scared too but i tried to play it off. i said ""oh hey mr randall, just heading back up to bed."" i took sarah's hand but he grabbed my other. he then told her to go upstairs. she looked at me for a second then did as she was told. 

he watched her go then pulled me tight to him. he put his hand up my nightgown and cupped my bare breast. he rubbed his hard crotch against my hip. 
he said in my ear ""i can be persuaded to not tell mrs randall about this ... if you pay the sweet tax."" 

i was furious and terrified but i had been raised differently. i looked him right in the eye and with all the false bravado i could muster said, ""my brother is a marine, my uncle is a sheriff and both he and my dad are vietnam vets. so if i were you i wouldn't say a thing to mrs randall."" 

he stared at me for the longest few seconds of my life, he looked a little scared and a little stunned and a little like ""sweet tax"" might be worth it anyway. in the end he smiled and let go. he did a very creepy overly exaggerated courtly bow and waved me upstairs. 

sarah seemed surprised to see me so soon. i asked her if she had ever had to pay the sweet tax before. she started to cry again and kept saying ""i'm sorry, i'm sorry."" i got dressed and got my things. i noticed when i said sweet tax her aunt became agitated, i wondered how many times she had paid it. finally when i heard footsteps pass us and a door open and close i left that house of horrors. 

when i got home i woke my parents and told them, it took everything my mom had to convince my dad not to go back there with a shotgun. part of me wanted him to. my uncle was called and he came over right away. he agreed with my mom, that this could all go very badly for sarah. he said it would be ""he said, she said"" and even though i am his niece sarah would have to admit to sexual abuse for services to step in. he said he would go and take care of him right now if i wanted him to. i didn't know what that meant and i didn't ask. i just said no.

sarah avoided me at school for weeks and i was glad. finally we came face to face in a bathroom and she made to leave quickly. i grabbed her arm and said ""talk to me"".

she shook her head and said ""i can't.""

i had never been so angry in my life and shouted, ""really? *now* you can't talk to me?""

she lifted up her shirt and there were three curling iron burns, that looked infected on her side. ""no i can't and i can't ever talk to you again."" she looked down biting her lip and pitifully said ""i'm so sorry, i know you wish you had never met me.""

""that isn't true."" 

she smiled, the saddest smile and said ""i wish i had never met me"" and left.

we didn't speak again until the following year. before classes started one of my friends told me she saw *big red bag lady* (her school wide nickname) crying in the bathroom. i found her and her hair had been chopped off. it looked like a raggedy fuzzy orange pyramid. i didn't say a word i just took her hand. she let me lead her to one of my favorite teachers. he was so kind. looking back now as an adult i realize he was a closeted gay man and i wonder what struggles he himself was facing. sarah told us her mother in a fit of rage had cut her hair off. i told sarah that my cousin was a hairdresser and i would take her right now to get it fixed. my teacher said he would cover for us. she refused. she said it would only make it worse and it would grow back. she was hollow, she was frail and she was defeated. after she left i told my teacher about how her step dad had touched me. he looked disgusted and like he wanted to cry. he put his hand on my shoulder and said ""just be her friend. she won't be in that house forever."" and he was right.

seven weeks later, sarah slit her wrists while she was in the bed she shared with her aunt.

people came to our school and we had an assembly. afterwards we all had to talk to someone and prove we weren't suicidal. i couldn't eat or sleep and i was wracked with sadness and guilt.  but i had a good and loving family who got me through it.

i went to sarah's funeral. my brother took leave and he, my dad and uncle went with me. we sat in the back and watched as sarah's mom became a poster child for grieving mothers. she even buckled at the knees and wailed at sarah's casket. she cried out for everyone to hear. 
""her hair, her beautiful hair, we knew she had *the sickness* when she cut off all her beautiful hair.""
my brother had his arm around me so tightly because i was shaking so badly that my arm started to go numb. 

at the graveside her stepfather gave us a flourished hand wave and almost sounded jovial as he said ""salutations"". my uncle had a vice grip on my dad but my brother went up to her stepfather and hugged him while whispering in his ear. i don't know what he said, i never asked, but sarah's step dad looked like he had just seen her ghost.

when it was all mercifully over i saw a man who looked familiar. i walked over to where he was watching from a distance.

""are you sarah's dad?"" 

he looked at me for a moment with tear rimmed haunted eyes ""yes, i am."" 

""you have her hair""

i started to cry as i put my arms around him. he tensed up for a moment, then breathed out and hugged me, so tight, so fatherly. i like to think that for one brief moment he felt he was hugging his own daughter for the first time. i noticed a woman in the car with two boys - both looked just like sarah.


i think about you sarah. i wonder who you would have become. i know you wanted to open a cafe and serve sweets and sandwiches. i wonder if we could have been friends once you were free from that hell. i think of you when i look at my three daughters. who are the very light of my heart. i especially think of you when i look at my oldest who is 15 but still looks 8 years old through my mom goggles. my daughter with her pink hair and her father's eyes. when i tell her that she lights up, because she is the light of his heart too. i think about you when my only son, who i probably spoil too much, rolls his eyes at the fact that his father and i are ""still goth"". 

i think about you whenever i hear bauhaus.

and i am so so sorry. sorry that every adult failed you. sorry that i failed you. sorry that some adults take their own baggage out on their children. sorry that some adults are disgusting and cross boundaries. sorry that you never got that feeling of rushing home to make curfew, sharing one beer between 10 friends, that feeling of first kissing a boy. i am so sorry that i wasn't a better friend for you. 

but it is different now, sarah. teachers step in. people believe. bullies are confronted. different isn't seen as so bad now. 

you are still with me, sarah, and you always will be. ",11
"had an encounter with a police officer as a black man that i thought would end my life. i'm posting this aware of the hate i will receive. i am going to post this and not come back to it, because i just need to get it out. i am not reading your hate comments or comments invalidating this experience i had. 

on monday afternoon, i was working late at my job. i was supposed to be working with a professor in the lab that evening (i'm a medical student). i told my professor that i wouldn't be able to meet with him as promised, but i would make it to the lab after it closes if he thought it okay. he said it was fine and said he would speak to security to let them know i would be in after hours. (note: it is not uncommon to have students working in labs at all hours of the night. i go to an ivy league institution and went to an ivy league for my undergraduate education, too. many of my friends have slept in labs.) 

i go to the lab, the security person working at the front desk says i have been cleared by my professor, but she was on her way out and would let the incoming security guard know i'd be in the lab. i said thanks and went on with my evening. 

about four hours later--it's almost 10 pm at that point--i'm immersed in my assignment, trying to get done, because i need to be in bed before midnight. without warning, the door to the lab opened and a security guard i hadn't seen before (a white man) asked me what i was doing. i looked at my white lab coat, stared at him through my thick goggles, and raised the tongs i had in my right hand. ""i'm working on homework,"" i said. my heart was already at about 110 bpm, and i average about 65 bpm. 

the guard asked if i had permission, and i said yes. i told him the earlier guard said they'd let the new guard know i'm in the office. i gave him my professor's info and a business card. the guard didn't care; he immediately asked if i was a student. i said yes. i reached for my campus id and the guard reached for his taser. i started shaking violently and i thought i was going to throw up. i told him i was going to get my id. he told me to stand up and leave the lab and that he was calling campus safety (basically campus police). 

i didn't want to contaminate my sample (i had been working on it for almost five hours), so i tried to cover it gently, but the security guard walked up and pulled my arm away and everything fell off the table. i didn't make a sound. i just followed him as he called campus safety. 

campus safety arrived as i sat in the lobby and i just knew it would all be resolved. *i'm a nice, soft-spoken black guy. i don't have dreads or muscles or anything like that. i'm average height. they won't shoot me. my hands are in my lap.* all of these thoughts were eradicated when a (white) campus safety officer walked through the door and began speaking to the security guard. it was like i wasn't even there. 

""he said he was given permission to be here,"" the guard said. 

""yeah, probably just a punk trying to cheat or steal something,"" the campus safety guy shot back. 

i went against every black person's safety guidelines when police are present: i spoke up. i advocated for myself. 

i jumped in and said, ""no, my professor said i could be here. you can call him."" the campus safety officer walked over to me and asked me to search and frisk me for any ""stolen property."" i said i didn't feel comfortable. he said i didn't have a choice or i can be detained. i let him. as he was searching me, his hand roaming down and up my shaking legs, he asked me what i was studying. i told him, with precision, what i was studying, where i had done my undergrad, where my parents lived. basically my entire resume. i think i even regurgitated a project i had received global recognition for. 

i just wanted him to see me as a person in case he shot me. 

he finished up and told me to leave the building. i asked if i could go back and get my backpack. we went to the lab, the campus safety officer searched my backpack, then told me to clean up the mess i had made when my materials fell on the floor. i got down on my hands and knees and scrubbed the tile while the guard and the officer watched. they made small talk. apparently the guard had just transitioned to nights. they watched me the whole time. 

when i was done, i left and was told to only be in the lab during business hours. as i left the building, i could see other lights on with students in the windows. each hunched over their homework, concentrating, unaware that i was leaving -- devastated, humiliated, and exposed. 

the next day, i expected my professor to completely fail me for not getting my assignment done on time. when i went to his office, he told me he had received a report from campus safety about me and asked what had happened. i told him what i said here. he began to cry. he's an american muslim. he told me in the report i was caught stealing and vandalizing equipment and that nothing i said to him was reflected in that report. i was shocked. 

he said he knew something was wrong with the report the moment he read it, because he knew i wasn't that type of person. even if i was--even if i had vandalized and stolen something--why go to such extremes to reprimand instead of having a conversation with the student? he told me about his experiences of being bullied and targeted for being muslim. he told me he knew what i was feeling and to take some time off. he gave me a full pass on the assignment and a chance to re-do it. 

i sat in my car and cried. my professor asked if i wanted to file a report and make it known. he told me that since i go to an ivy league, it would easily gain traction in the media. they could pull security footage and see that i was telling the truth. it could be a big deal. i said no. 

i just want to be a student, not an activist or another person that's taking social media by storm via hashtags. 

i sat in my car and cried my eyes out. it's really not fair. i don't want this. i love police officers. i do. i respect them. i could never do their work. but why... god, why am i--and millions of others--treated like this? i have only ever had positive experiences with police up until now. when i see hashtags about police violence, i always say to myself, ""well, at least it's not me."" but now it *is* me. 

the only things i want for myself: i want to get my md, be a doctor, make people better, and just live my life. 

things i don't want for myself: to get shot for being black. 

thank you. 

**edit:** while i didn't read any of your comments intentionally, i did feel immense guilt for not reporting this adequately. i reached out to my faculty person and he actually did report it anyway. it was anonymous, of course, but he is scheduled to meet with the dean of the department and i am invited to that meeting. it's next week. 

but i do want to say one thing: i gave in and read a few comments, and i see a lot of you saying it is my responsibility to report this or else someone could die or it could be worse. yes, it can be. it could be. it *will* be, but don't you see how fucked up that is? that it's still my responsibility to bring this up to the very people that don't give a fuck? don't you see how devastating this is for me? i want to be angry at you all telling me to tell people and speak up. i do, but i know you're only telling me because it's what's best. in this situation, i don't get a choice and i'm recognizing that now. i think my choices were taken from me when i was born black. 

this is so frustrating and horrifying. 

another clarification: i wrote in this post that i'm non-threatening and that i don't have dreads or muscles. in no way did i mean those as bad or ugly things to have while being black; on the contrary, i think all black is beautiful. but not everyone thinks that, and i just wanted to add it for sake of showing how absurd it all is. 

to all of my black friends who have read this: thank you for surviving this far, even if you don't experience or racism or bigotry on the levels that others do. your courage to still be black and alive is inspiring to me, and i have to do something. ",11
"my healthy adult cat died from anesthesia today. supposedly there's only a 1 / 100,000 chance for that to happen.

it was just a routine dental cleaning. you don't even necessarily have to put them to sleep to clean their teeth to clean them, but it's usually done anyway because otherwise the cats will struggle.

he had to fast beforehand. we didn't give him his usual breakfast and he kept crying to us, wondering why we weren't feeding him like normal.

we had to shove him into a pet kennel to take him to the vet. he hasn't been there many times before, so he still wasn't used to it and was really stressed out. i told him it would be okay, but it wasn't.

he didn't even make it to the actual dental cleaning. he had a really bad reaction to the anesthesia and had to go on life support almost immediately. after several seizures and a heart attack, his lungs had filled up with fluid and we had to put him down.

it wasn't supposed to be like this.",11
"to all the people blaming the friends of the girl who was murdered by who she thought was her uber driver last week..... for those unaware, a senior at the university of south carolina got into the wrong car last week thinking it was her uber. her body was found a couple days after by two hunters. her murderer was also arrested the same day.

i keep seeing people on social media saying it's her friends faults for leaving her at a bar alone. fuck you all. how ignorant do you have to be to go after her fucking friends like that? sure it always helps to travel in twos but for fucks sake... that does not make the fact that she was murdered her friends fucking faults bc they weren't w her. 

i attended usc my freshman year of college. 5 points is the big bar neighborhood. i was always fucking around by myself. i would uber by myself to work, by myself home from the bars, by myself to a boys house after i had been out drinking all night, by myself to parties or friends houses. obviously columbia, sc is not one of the safest places, but you can't always rely on your friends to do everything w you. 

maybe if people weren't so goddam shitty then people would be able to do things like uber or walk places by themselves and not have to worry ab getting raped or murdered. 

i've lost four close friends since i was a sophomore in high school. i'm 21. four fucking friends. the guilt i felt after their deaths of ""i could've done this or that or been here or there and they wouldn't be where they are now"" is fucking real and that feeling fucking hurts without shitty people telling me it was my fault. 

i hope to god none of the people who are incorrectly placing the blame on her friends ever have to experience that pain bc holy shit it hurts. at the end of the fucking day it is nobodies fault except the person who committed the crime.

"i am tired of being sexualized as a 19 year old and i am allowed to be disgusted by the pursuits of older men.. **\*\*obviously there are young people who are into old people. this isn't about them. they can do their thing.\***

adult teenagers (18,19) are so sexualized and i'm fucking tired of it. as soon as there are no legal restraints, y'all pounce on us. there was a countdown for marykate and ashley to turn 18. the day emma watson turned 18 they were taking upskirt photos. society fetishizes youth so much and it's strongest on reddit.

whenever young people, like 18-20 express disgust with the pursuits of an older person, they are demonized. i've seen young people on be called agist, bigoted and disgusting for being grossed out. we are allowed to be disgusted by the pursuits of old people. we are allowed to be disgusted by the very idea of you approaching us. we are allowed to be grossed by older people, **even if it hurts your feelings.  get fucking over it.**

i'm not talking about being grossed out by their existence, but being grossed out by their advances is okay.

but a lot of you guys don't realize that the 20 year old cashier is probably uncomfortable around you.

i layer tf up whenever i'm not on campus to avoid the looks of older men on the public transit. so does damn near every other girl i know without a car. we were having a discussion in class and people were talking about being stared at and creeped on by 30 and 40 year old dudes and what they do. most of us call someone, so we look busy. we talked about our old dude protocols at parties and shit and how hard it is being fetishized by these grown ass men. especially a lot of us feel like ""kids"" compared to them. not like ""little kids"". ugh it's hard to explain. but a lot of us have been catcalled since we were 12. it's harder now because it's acceptable to be approached them. a few girls cried about it. it makes us feel gross.

i hate being hypersexualized because of my youth. i hate the oldheads who pursue me to fufill their ""barely legal"" fantasies. i hate being pursued by older men. they gross me out period. i am allowed to feel this way and i'm tired of being told i can't. i'm fucking tired of it. i layer tf up whenever i'm not on campus or the mall to avoid the looks of older men on the public transit. **so does damn near every other girl i know without a car.**

there is a 20 year old guy being ripped to shreds  because he was disgusted by pursuits of a women who was like 31. there was a 19 year old guy who was also being demonized because he was grossed about by a 28 year old. the guys are told they should be grateful that a women that age is into them. they are being so defensive about their age. aging is normal, it happens to everyone. i can't wait to be 30 and thriving. when i am, i won't chase after 19 year old guys. i won't cry if they find me gross.

i am not being bigoted, you are not a protected class.

**young people who are disgusted by older people trying to be with them don't have to grow up. old people who can't deal with it should.**

**young people who are disgusted by older people trying to be with them don't have to grow up. old people who can't deal with it should.**

"i am so incredibly happy i cleaned my flat and i can't tell anyone!. so, i am chronically depressed and have real issues to keep my flat clean. and i do not mean ""forgets to vacuum"" oh boy no. i mean "" stacking garbage that high that some rooms become uninhabitable"".

of course that is not a thing you tell people. i am far too much ashamed to let anyone know.

three full days of intense work went into ordering my things, collecting garbage off the floor, stuffing all in all 12 giant blue garbage bags with everything plastic, stacking eight crates with old paper and bringing everything to a collection point, then cleaning everything, **everything**, and fighting the smell and the flies.

now i am done. you could eat off of the floor right now. everything smells great and looks even better. my kitchen sink is gleaming and has no dirty dishes in it and everything looks just so inviting. no flies anywhere and have i mentioned how great and clean it smells?

i was not able to have friends over for a year now. a year! but now i'm inviting everyone. still can't tell them why i never invited them though. so i am telling you reddit. because i just have to tell someone how great and accomplished i feel right now.

edit3: holy crap people! i've been gilded and this is now my top post of all time. so many people have said that my post inspires them to clean up themselves and this makes me even happier than my own clean flat. having a positive influence on cleanlyness is the last thing **i** would have **ever** expected xd

please do feel encouraged. it is hard work, but it's **way less** work than it seems when you stand there and stare at the chaos. just power through and open your eyes to the improvements. feel encouraged by your own progress and believe me when i tell you it feels absolutely positively **amazing** when you are done. it's like the shutters have opened to let light in, like a big weight has been lifted off your chest and you have such a good and valid reason to be proud of yourself. heck i've made videos on my phone to remind myself how it feels and i will definetly use them to keep my power level up.

"my aspie bf has completely accepted me into his life. when we started dating his parents were unsure as to how well our relationship would function. and to be completely honest, i was as well. he's very particular as to who he allows to be a part of his life, but once you're in, you're in for the long haul. 

the first six months were hard. i've never been with anyone diagnosed with aspergers before him. so a lot of our earlier months together was me trying to understand his boundaries and characteristics. 

he's routine based, so me asking to go visit him often got in the way that. him sitting in the car next to me was way too close for his personal liking, so he'd ask that i pull over so he could walk home. i would reach for his hand to hold, but he'd flinch about two feet in the air. i never once got mad or upset at him for any of it. i remained patient through it all. through every episode and every time he would brush me off to the side to avoid opening up to me. 

i knew from the start he was special, and i wanted to be a part of his life for as long as he'd let me. 

here we are a year and a half later, and things couldn't be more different. 

we're living together. he embraces changes in his routine and i no longer feel like an obstacle. he's taught me to have patience, and to always be strong when i feel like the forces of the world are working against me. he tickles me relentlessly when he wants to see my smile or hear my laugh. he puts his arms and hands on me with absolute confidence. he wouldn't dare let me drop him off at work until he's told me ""i love you so much!"" at least 50 times. my favorite development we've made is we both tell each other everything. we literally can sit on the porch for hours just talking and getting lost in conversation. he's so fucking hilarious, i swear we probably spend about an hour everyday on the porch just laughing. 

things still get tough from time to time. i don't always know how to react when he begins to have an episode, and he doesn't always know how to approach me when i'm a crying mess. but one thing is certain, no matter what happens between us, we will always come out stronger on the other side. 

today he told me ""i don't give a shit what order my days go in anymore. i just need you to be the first person i see when i wake up. that's the only part about my days that need to stay the same""

i'm in.

"im a stripper. and i hate that i can't fucking talk to anyone about it!! i have the most interesting fucking job, i've only told two of my flatmates (for safety), in case i don't come home one night or something. one of them told literally all of her friends, and that's why i won't tell anyone. their responses have made me realize i have to keep this job a secret. 

a) one of her friends just assumed that i sleep with the customers too (what the fuck??) and that i am some wild and crazy party girl ? always winks at me when he comes over and asks who i'm with this week.. like what does sex have to do with stripping? 

b) another one of her friends has proceeded to call me her 'stripper friend'. we're not friends in the first place, and don't tell my that my job is my whole identity. idk i don't like being an accessory to make someone else seem more interesting. 

c) and to top it all off now all of her friends basically look at me like a piece of sex candy. i can hear them whispering comments to each other when i come in to do the dishes or whatever and they didn't used to do that before. 

i wish people didn't react so weirdly or judge because it's a good job!! i meet some really interesting people, i make a lot of money it's a smart fucking move bc i'm in uni and frankly don't have time for a job at tescos, at least this is from 9pm-5am and i make the same in a night as i would working for a month at a grocery store. 

also the job itself, all i do is walk around in lingerie and heels, occasionally get called up to dance on the stage (don't have to take my top off if i don't feel like it, i do whatever i want). the customers aren't allowed to touch me, they can take me for private dances which are 3minutes and there are cameras installed everywhere and the bouncers are huge and so sweet so nobody tries anything. plus funny shit happens all the time and i really just wish i could tell someone about it. 

like last week a guy wanted to be my sugar daddy and gave me his business card (we aren't allowed to do this btw i had to get it when he handed me my tip)  and we've been texting and the man wanted to send me 2k just to get coffee for a few hours lmao. the psychology behind these men ... i've learned a lot from this job about men and rich people.

"unpopular opinion: your fat/obese pet isn't cute, it's suffering. i love all animals, but i especially bond with rabbits. i follow a rabbit subreddit, and it kills me when i see pics of overweight buns with the owner all, ""my big fluff just being cute!"" or something like that. rabbits have such sensitive gis and their dietary needs are specific. they can get sick and die very quickly. an overweight bunny can easily die, and their life expectancy is in fact significantly shortened. it's not sweet, cute, endearing, or loving to overfeed, or constantly provide ""junk"" food to, your companion. if you can't properly care for a pet, of any species, why have it??

edit: first off, wow, this is clearly something a lot of people think about, and resonates with quite a few people. that being said, i'm personally specifically referring to the willfully ignorant pet owners who don't properly educate themselves on their pet breed of choice, and end up causing that pet to suffer unnecessarily by overfeeding and/or under exercising, and especially those that justify it by saying the pet wants it or that the pet is just so cute that way.

i am in no way referring to breeds that are naturally bigger or the rare pet that gets chubby despite the efforts of the owner, or owners who have adopted obese pets and are showing them the love and care they deserve via a proper diet so they can happily enjoy the daily activities they are meant to. 

i'm not sure why some people have felt the need to internalize my post and take it as a fat shaming post, when in reality if i'm shaming anything, it's neglect and ignorance that is manifesting as grossly excessive weight. 

also, i certainly never mentioned people or overweight/obese people, so for those of you trying to twist my post into somehow shaming unhealthy humans: just don't. we are autonomous beings, and we are free to make unhealthy choices that cause us to suffer unnecessarily all on our own. there are also human physiques/body types that are naturally and quite healthily ""chubby"". i know this. everyone should know this. when it comes to humans, i would never presume to tell someone fully capable of making their own decisions, that they should be careful of their weight. pets are a different story.",11
"i witnessed true love last night. despite the cliche title, i truly witnessed a love that brought me to tears when i got home from work last night. 

i work as a waiter at a hotel. last night this elderly(late 60's/early 70's) white, seemingly wealthy couple came into the restaurant and my co-worker seated them. we usually do our own tables, but because we were so busy last night we helped each other out. at one point the elderly couple signaled to me that they were ready to order. once again we were super busy so i usually find it rude when people go out of their way to make their order, but once i took their order i understood why. 

the husband began ordering and started stuttering to an extent i've never heard before. it was very clear that he had a speech disorder. i could tell the wife had told her husband very extensively what she wanted, as a way for him to practice ordering. it took awhile for him to order, and in the meantime she was sitting there and she looked so proud and content despite her husband's immense stammering. 

honestly the whole thing just did something to me. it was beautiful and just made me realize that a huge part of love is acceptance, tolerance and support. she could've made the order and made things a lot easier for her husband and avoid the stares from other tables, but she didn't. instead she supported him and was proud to see him complete the order.

another thing this whole thing did was remind me that life is difficult for all of us. i assumed these wealthy people had everything going for them and i'm sure they do, but it just reminded me that all of us have our issues. i initially took their gesture of wanting to order as being rude, but i think they signaled it because he really wanted to get the order right.

"i stopped myself relapsing on my drug addiction and i'm really proud of myself!. a couple years ago i had a serious addiction to benzos. valium, xanax, ambiens you name it i was taking it, up to 10 pills a day for over a year. i went through serious withdraws and therapy to get off them. 
recently i found out i failed at the very last hurdle of starting my dream career after years of trying. at the same time my relationship of two years failed. 
i have came so close to getting back on those drugs but each time i have stopped myself and i'm still 2 years clean and i am still some how sober...

if anyone has gone through anything similar and needs advice or guidance, please feel free to contact me. stay safe! 

edit: wow i did not expect my post to blow up like this! thank you all for your kind supportive comments it means so much to me. i have also received a few very heart warming dms and others looking for advice, i will reply to every last message! you guys have really choked me up today and gave me even more motivation to stay straight :) and thank you very much for the silver and gold!

"people in relationships deserve to have friends too and i'm sick of being told otherwise. i've been looking to make new friends on discord and reddit and i swear to god some people on here really piss me off. if i don't mention i'm married and do mention that i'm female (fucking god forbid), my inbox gets flooded with men wanting to snapchat or video call. no genuine interest in friendship whatsoever. if i mention i'm married, i get asked ""but doesn't your husband keep you company?"". first of all, my life doesn't revolve around my partner. it's in the name, we are partners not joined at the hip. i'm entitled to and just god damn deserve to have friends outside of my relationship with him. i'm so tired of this fucking view that people in a relationship should rely on their partner for their happiness and social needs. that's not a healthy mindset and it's certainly not sustainable and i'm fucking sick of being disregarded for platonic friendships because i'm married and a fucking woman.

edit: wow this *really* blew up! thanks for all your stories and opinions i've loved reading them. a lot of you gave me great ideas for different ways to meet new people, different ways and different apps to use. i really appreciate it all and i intend to try them!",11
"i secretly bought tickets to endgame. so my step-son has gone through some shit. his bio dad is an absolute piece of shit and beat him. check out some of my old posts in other subreddits if you want the full story. when we finally won custody of the kiddo, he was having a hard time adjusting to a loving family. he was having trouble with school and getting into fights. we pulled him from his old school and moved about an hour north. he's absolutely flourishing and even has irl friends as well as online ones. i'm so proud of him. i've been telling him we're going to see endgame next week if he keeps up his good behavior. i bought tickets two days ago and this morning i called into school on his behalf. we're going to a 9am showing. i'm so proud of him. he's had a true hero's journey and his story is just starting. 

please forgive formatting. i'm on mobile and am currently in the parking lot of the theater.

"to the guy who was taking a shit louder than me, thank you.. i was very embarrassed to poop in a public restroom because, to be honest it smelled bad. it's awkward in general but as soon as i heard the roar come from your ass i felt a little better about it. you're a real hero.

"my girlfriend doesn't get enough credit for being incredible. we met in college, freshman year. i was such a little shit- so damaged, not respectful at all, no work ethic, and to be honest i had a lot of unprocessed issues from my bad upbringing. her situation wasn't terribly different from mine, but there was just something different about her. i was cocky, but she was strong- actually strong. her shit was barely together, but she was keeping it together with pure force of will; working for her money and studying her ass off. nobody knew how much she suffered except me. we shared stories of childhood abuse and helped each other cope with the mental illness we were both hiding.

when i couldn't keep a job because of undiagnosed ptsd, she supported me. when i started working, she drove all the way to my parents' hellhole house to pick my ass up and drop me off after, every single day. when i was healing and processing, she listened and listened and listened. i used to dream of supporting her in return, handing her fat stacks of cash, and finally being the shoulder instead of the crier. and over the past couple of years, i've come close to realizing that dream. we now live together in our little apartment, where i listen to her, support her, and just can't wait to do it for the rest of my life! i'm happy to say i truly admire her; she's my hero. i just wish everyone knew how much she went through just to get here, and how i could never have done it without her.",11
"you truly never will know the amount of strangers who secretly admire you.. you really don't know how many people secretly admire you, are jealous of you, find you attractive, or wish they could talk to you. it's wild. there's a guy who sits behind me in one of my lectures. he's one of the cutest guys i've ever seen, i find him ridiculously attractive. i'm too shy to ever say anything to him. it blows my mind how i could feel this way about him and he'll never know. there's so many girls i see where i wish i had their hair, clothes, anything, and they'll never know either. if you're ever feeling insecure just know that there are definitely people out there who quietly/secretly admire you but will never say anything. just think about all the people you see even just on the street that you admire who you'll never talk to. it's a strange and comforting thought.",11
"can't tell family so i'm telling you internet stranger.. my 17 year old brother was killed about 3 years ago in a vehicle collision. he was stopped for road work and was rear ended by a semi. semi driver was found at fault and convicted.

i think about him constantly. the happiest part my day is that split second after waking up. because in that moment i forget he's dead. 

i regularly dream he's still alive and the whole thing was a crazy misunderstanding. we laugh, we hug and i tell him i'm so relieved. then i wake up and he's still dead.

just now i was browsing netflix and saw a show i know he watched. so i thought i'd call him and ask if he recommends it. and then i remembered, he's dead.

he was my identity. we didn't grow up with the best parents. so i did everything i could to be an ideal role model. everything i did was to set an example. and now he's dead, and i don't know what the fucking point is anymore. 

i just fucking miss him so much it's unbearable. ",11
"i (m24) wet the bed on the first night she stayed over at my place.. we were dating for a few weeks, and things started to become more serious. eventually, she decided it was time to stay the night. as the title explains, this is when i wet the bed. 

this happened once before, when i was like 15. i can tell you it's the most horrible experience ever. to wake up, knowing that your date will definitely know. 

i woke her up, guided her to the couch. i cleaned everything, flipped the mattress, took a shower and we could go back to bed. it was really gross. not like a little drop: it was like i emptied a bottle of soda on my bed. the next morning i felt awful. she acted like she didn't notice anything. at the moment she acted like she was half asleep. i immediately explained what happened. 

i think i'm the luckiest guy in history. she could laugh about the entire thing, and swore she would never tell anyone. after that i wasn't sure if we'd see each other again. it would make sense if she'd never ever came back. i'm glad that she did. 

right now we're together for a year and a half. traveling the world and enjoying life.

(edit) 
thank you so much for all the positive response. it's truly heartwarming to read everything. all the stories of people who experienced something similar made me realise i most certainly are not the only one. 

all of this did make me realise even more how much i love my girlfriend! she is absolutely amazing. 

also, this specific night i didn't drink anything, and i don't think there's anything medically wrong with me. 

stranger: thanks for my first gold!! really appreciate it!",11
"i'm 25. yesterday afternoon i had to decide to not resuscitate my mom and she passed away.. i didn't know what to do. her health was so bad and she would have had significant brain damage if she woke up from the coma. i keep wondering if anything would have been different if i got to her sooner... but the doctors kept saying ""she's very very ill"". 

i just hope you know we all love you and are here for you, despite what you thought. i hope you are not in pain anymore.

update: guys, so many amazing responses. my younger brother and i have looked at a few of these and they have really made us feel.. warm. i appreciate all of you. seriously. will be replying soon!",11
"being homeless for 2 yrs of college was the best thing to ever happen to me.. i grew up 3 hours outside of pittsburgh, pa with my mother and 3 younger siblings.my mom was a single mother and worked a minimum wage job, so we never had much, but that was ok, we made ends meet anyhow. freshman year of hs i got a job at a local bakery and immediately started saving money for college,to help out around the house, and to buy myself a car. 

junior year of highschool i bought a 2002 dodge carvan. senior year i was accepted into the university of pittsburgh and received some academic scholarships that covered my tuition.  room and board were not covered so i opted to pay for the meal plan but not the housing because it was way too expensive for me.

whenever it was time to head out for college i scrapped all of the back row seating in my caravan(the old carvan seats were removable) and i purchased a twin mattress and laid it on the floor of my van, i also saved enough money to have my windows tinted. i purchased a parking pass on campus, chose a spot on the top level of the parking garage and lived out of my van for the next 2 years. 

like i said, this was the best thing to ever happen to me, did living out of a van suck? of course it did. the weather in pittsburgh sucks. super hot and humid in the summer time and freezing cold and snowy in the winter time. that being said, being homeless forced me to take advantage of everything the campus had to offer since i wanted to spend as little time in my van as possible. i ended up spending most of my time throughout the week at the library and consequentially ended up studying and reviewing classroom material a lot more than i would have if i had the luxury of going home and turning on the tv or falling asleep for hours in my room.

i frequented my professors office hours if i had questions about course material after class was over because what else did i have to? go sit around in my hot or freezing cold car? i ended up getting really close to some of my professors because of this, and it really helped me excel in the classroom.

our campus had a free gym available to students, complete with locker rooms and showers, so every morning i would wake up at 6 am, head to the gym. workout for an hour and a half or so, take a shower at the gym, then go about the rest of my day.i learned a lot about my body during this time and absolutely fell in love with physical fitness. i was able to construct work out routines for myself that i still follow everyday, i also ended up doing a lot of jogging around campus and frequented schenley park and really develop an appreciation for the outdoors.

i attended alot of social events, guest speakers, plays, charities, student life events around campus too and this was really good for me because i ended up meeting a lot of new friends by attending all these things. prior to college i would have considered myself and introvert, i didn't really speak much unless spoken to, but again not wanting to sit around in my van all day made me venture outside of my comfort zone and do new things and i really developed an outgoing personality because of it.

other than that my time was spent with my new found friends or working at the campus book store.

junior year i moved into a house with a group of friends and stayed there senior year too. all of those girls are still my best friends 7 yrs later. 

even after i moved out of the van i continued to spend hours at the library, working out everyday, attending events,etc and i really think that having to deal with the struggles that i had to go through really made me into a better person.

since then i got a really got job and have been helping my siblings prepare for life after hs and i've even been able to help my mother out a little bit.

it just feels good :)",11
"i'll be calling cps on my ""friend"" in a few hours ..... if it wasn't enough witnessing her and her friend smoke literal.crack. with the baby in the car with the windows up, ""forgetting"" or choosing not to feed her for hours-sometimes a while day at a time, then i showed up to her house. a mutual friend told me it was a mess - but she failed to mention that there are no appliances or heat- furthermore there is also no furniture and bags upon bags upon bags of their ""things"" as well as literal garbage everywhere. i took pictures of the house but not sure how to post them. i have continued the friendship through the drug use and filth strictly so i could keep an eye on the 19 month old baby girl. this is just really really a shame. the baby deserves so much better. i'm putting my foot down at 8am. she brings her to me to watch (thankfully) quite often and brings a diaper bag with mayyyyyyybe a dirty pair or pants or a too small sleeper, tampons, & hairties. no diapes,wipes,formula,food. nothing for a baby. then completely forgets i have her. she will call the next day to see if she can come shower at my house or hide in my bathroom and do drugs, and tell me her grandma has her baby. or she will forget to come pick her up for 2 or 3 days .... and this next part is total speculation-but i am a bit concerned her boyfriend was recently inappropriate with her. she squeeled when i finally got her to let me change her poop-butt diaper- and was soooooo constipated that the turds came out as gumball sized rock-ass-hard marbles. and the bf just constantly makes sick fucking jokes about child rape and pedophilia. it stops today!! honestly she will probably be happy she doesn't have to care for her anymore. i will update if anyone cares to hear what happens .... sigh .... i wish she could see what a gift she had smh

"my boyfriend died in my arms two nights ago and my whole world is falling apart.. this is my first post ever so i apologize if it's not worded correctly.
on sunday night my boyfriend and i had a completely normal night. we were watching the finale of game of thrones like everyone else. he had complained about a stomach ache a couple hours earlier due to the pizza we ate so he had gone to the bathroom a few times during the episode. when the episode was done, he helped our friend down to the garage, came back up, gave me a huge hug and then went into the bathroom again. 

after a while i started to hear strange gurgling from the bathroom. it sounded weird but i assumed it was him throwing up and then turning the faucet on repeatedly. he usually wants me to leave him alone in the restroom so i didn't think anything of it. turns out that that gurgling was him dying, i just didn't realize it yet.

i started getting worried so i knocked on the door but he didn't respond. i peeked through the gap between the door and the floor and saw him laying on the floor. i panicked but i still assumed he was just asleep. i started jabbing him with a butter knife as hard as i could and when he didn't move i dialed 911. i was in complete panic at this point and the dispatcher had me kick the door in. 

when i got in i saw my baby completely helpless on the floor, all blue in his face. i immediately got him on his back and the dispatcher helped me with chest compressions. i kept going for what felt like forever, but in reality it was only around 15 min. eventually the fire department came and i just collapsed, called my mom, and threw up literally everywhere. 

the police later informed me that he didn't make it and i'm absolutely heartbroken. i have since had panic attacks multiple times a day, i can't focus, can't breathe, can't stop crying. i keep getting horrible flashbacks of him lying on the floor all blue in his face and i don't know how to get them out or even how to come back to earth during my panic attacks. i feel like i'm going crazy and i'm so scared that i will never be normal again.",11
"girl who knocked on my door and gave me churros. earlier i had a break down and i was crying really hard and writing my thoughts in a diary. i settled down to watch some youtube to calm down and the girl who lives across from me knocked on my door and said that she ordered takeaway but they gave her an extra box of churros by accident. i hadn't met her before but she so kindly let me have them. she seemed so friendly and smiley. i feel so incredibly shit and depressed tonight, but this cheered me up and made my day!",11
"she would have been 5 today. i still dream about her. in the dream, we are always at the beach near our house. i can see her in the distance in her favourite white dress. she sees me and starts running towards me. i can see her mischievous grin. she outstretches her arms for me to pick her up, but just as i'm about to, i wake up. i never quite manage to pick her up.

my wife didn't think that our daughter, molly, looked well one morning and took her to the doctor at 9 a.m. by 11 p.m., the doctor told us he was very sorry, but we needed to say goodbye. she was just a month shy of her third birthday.  

molly was an intelligent, funny, witty and caring little girl. she loved tractors and planes. she spoke english and my wife's native language dutch. she was the most amazing little person i have ever known. she was always happy and full of energy. everyone who met molly loved her. she touched so many lives in her short life.

we sat down at her bedside and told her how much we loved her. we said that it was okay to fall asleep and that everything was going to be fine. we kissed her and then my wife sang molly's favorite song - somewhere over the rainbow. this gave molly a final bit of peace and she slipped away. and then we both fell apart.

molly, i love you. i'm so proud of you. you are such a strong little girl. you are so much braver than i am. i will never give up on you. i'll pick you up one day and i'll twirl you around like you used to like. i'll give you a big kiss and tell you how much i love you. i'll never put you back down again, i promise.

happy birthday, molly munchkin.

edit: thank you so much to everyone who commented. i can't reply to everybody, but i read all of your messages. thank you to the people who gave gold and silver.

my wife and i are still devastated by the loss of our baby girl, but we take comfort in the fact that she passed away surrounded by the people who love her most.

molly died of an epileptic seizure. she had had seizures in the past, but we were told not to worry about it and that children often grow out of them.",11
"my wife of 6 years died in a car crash.. stupid fucking drunk drivers. don't drive if you're going to drink ffs. i'm so fucking devastated and lost without you. you were my better half, you made me the man i am today. i'll never forget your beautiful smile gorgeous. i'm in anguish. i'm also conflicted whether i'm angry that the other driver didn't die or i'm sorry that he didn't die. i don't know what to do anymore. 

i miss you jess. 

love tim. 


edit: 

thanks everyone for the kind messages. i posted here because i don't really know how to deal with all these emotions at the moment. i've never been depressed as such before but i'm at an all time low because of this unnecessary accident. the other driver didn't make it and died in hospital. i've ultimately made my piece with that driver and i hope he and my wife are in a better place. it's going to be a tough few days but i look forward to reading these messages when i'm feeling down. it comforts me knowing so many of you guys have empathy for me and for that i'm forever grateful. i love this community. stay safe on the road, boys and girls. 

also thanks to the anonymous user that gave me silver. no idea what it does but i really appreciate the support. ",11
i think ask reddit just saved my life. i was ready to do it i'd said my goodbyes and completely given up. then i saw that ask reddit about suicide notes. i swear i read every reply and cried for about an hour and i really thought about the impact my death will have on my mother and my sister and my friends. i'm a selfish piece of shit but i can't fuck up everyone who cares for me for the rest of their lives. i wouldn't want my worst enemy to feel how i feel now. i can't do that to my family and friends. so many people truly care for me even if i don't understand why i know they do. ,11
"my adult son asked me if being being abandoned by his mother affected his relationships with women...and it broke my heart.. using my fucked-up life alt for reasons.

when my son was 9 i asked for and received custody of my son.  since that time my ex remarried, had another child, and divorced...but retained custody of a child she had with her husband.  my ex had little contact with my son...every other weekend visitation (whereas when i was a non-custodial parent called him every night, saw him all the time because i had liberal visitation and took advantage of that).  i could go on and on with stories of her not supporting him but that may be getting too specific.

even now, as an adult...i text or call my son a couple times a week to ask how things are going...not because i'm a helicopter dad...just to let him know i care.  he barely talks to his mother...because she doesn't make an effort to contact him.

my son has had a number of failed relationships and has been kind of a mess since he got out of the military.  he's turning things around now but a couple months ago he asked me if his mother abandoning him affected his relationships with women (he tends to jump in too quickly and gets clingy)...and it broke me heart.  i started crying...and i'm crying again as i type this.

i told him yes, it probably does...and that i can't really offer him any advice but told him he needs to go back into therapy to learn how to deal with it.  i couldn't love him enough or do enough for him to offset the lack of interest his own mother has for him.  i can't fix it.  i can't make it better.  i just let him know that he's loved by myself and my side of the family (his grandmother on her side has little interest in him as well).  there's not much else i can do...but encourage him to to into therapy.

thanks for reading.",11
"i found out i was pregnant at 31 weeks, and i lost her at 38 weeks.. i am writing my story on a throw away account, because i don't want to explain myself or explain how i didn't know. it is tiring. please just understand that while this may be hard for some of you to believe, it's okay if you don't believe it. because it happened to me. i am living the reality and the pain of it's wrath, so don't worry. it is no sweat off your back to believe me. i just want someone to listen.


on june 28, 2018 i found out that i was 31 weeks pregnant. i have always had an irregular period, often going 7-10 months without menstruating. i didn't have any noticeable symptoms, and i didn't feel tempted to buy a test until a line developed on my stomach and i started to feel movement in my belly. 

the father is not a good man, and based on the timeline of my pregnancy, i conceived right at the end of our tumultuous relationship, which ended with police reports and him physically assaulting me. when i found out, i didn't tell him that i was pregnant for obvious reasons... as i knew was dangerous. what kind of mother would i be if i allowed an unfit man into my child's life? he was the kind of man who would become frustrated hearing a baby cry and end up smothering them. i would have visuals of his face on the 9'o clock news when i would even consider telling him. so i didn't. 

at the time, i was in a new relationship with a man that i felt deeply for, but i fell in love with a facade. i was honest about the possibility that i was 7 months pregnant before i found out how far along i was, as i knew my sexual history and i hadn't been sexually active since my previous relationship. he did not want the baby and i (regrettably) mirrored his desire and we made the decision, together, to terminate the pregnancy. well, after finding out that i was 31 weeks pregnant and giving birth in 9 weeks, everything changed. he shamed me for my pregnancy and told me that he felt betrayed, even though this has happened prior to meeting him. i'll get back to this.

i'm not going to sugar coat anything. i'm a 25 year old college drop out making minimum wage in one of the richest counties in the country. i knew that i couldn't raise this child that i just found out would be here in a matter of weeks. i am not fit to provide them with what they need financially, economically, mentally, emotionally. and at this point, i was on my own. my boyfriend at the time became a part time boyfriend who strategically used the phrase ""i'm sorry that you have to go through this"". ladies, don't stick with a guy who ostracizes you when you are going through something. big red flag. i should have listened to myself.

considering where i am in my life and how sudden this pregnancy came about, i made the hardest decision i have ever made. i decided to place my child with an adoptive family. i went through the process alone, as i was now a single parent. over the weeks, my belly began to grow bigger and bigger. you really start to pop in your third trimester. my relationship with my boyfriend at the time deteriorated. as i became more pregnant, he became increasingly distant. my hormones were raging, so when he would mistreat me, i would freak myself into anxiety attacks and the amount of stress that he put me through is something that no one should do to another person. it's as if he wanted to ignore the fact that i was pregnant. he would intentionally make me feel bad, and i just took it. i was vulnerable and i thought i was in love.

the weeks between finding out i was pregnant and delivering were the hardest weeks of my life. sometimes i still can't believe that i made it out alive. i would go to bed every night in tears. there is no pain like an internal conflict, when your moral compass is spinning out of control. i now know that i was doing everything wrong. i was giving away the greatest gift that i was ever given, and that was being a mother. i was staying with a man who treated me like shit. i didn't rub my belly or sing to my baby, because i didn't want to get attached. i didn't even find out the gender until two weeks before. it was a girl.

at 37 weeks, i lost my job. i had planned on working until i went into labor, but i was laid off due to ""reduction in staffing"". two days after that, my boyfriend broke up with me. i later found out he had been cheating the entire time anyway. he's married now. (there is a lot that i could say about this man and the way he treated me during and long after our relationship, but i have made peace with the pain, and when i think about him now, i am only ashamed of myself for putting him above my child. i called him from my hospital bed after i lost my baby, and all he said was ""that sucks, good luck with the stillbirth."")

at 38 weeks, 2 days i went in to the hospital because i had stopped feeling my baby move and i wasn't having anymore contractions. the nurses hooked me up to a heart monitor, but they couldn't get anything. so, a doctor brought in an ultrasound and tried to scan for her heart, but it wasn't moving. she brought in a second doctor, and they just stood there without saying a word, moving the device over and over again. i can't explain the feeling i had. i knew before i walked into the hospital that something was wrong, and something just told me i wasn't going home with my baby. when i saw the look on their faces, i said ""you can't find her heartbeat, can you?"" and they just didn't say anything. so i said, ""it's okay."" i don't know why i said that, i think i was still trying to be courteous, even on my hospital bed. because i knew they were trying so hard, but even i could see on the screen that her heart was not moving. one of the doctors shut off the machine and said, ""i'm sorry, but there is no heartbeat."" 

you know what's crazy is that when i found out i was 7 months pregnant, i thought that was the worst day of my life. but losing my child was the worst day of my fucking life. the sound that came out of my mouth was like a wail that i've never made before. i remember lifting my arm up to cry, and one of the nurses grabbed my hand and she just squeezed it. everyone in the room remained silent and let me cry. they cried with me. 

i stayed in the hospital to be induced for labor. in my distraught state, i requested a c-section. the doctor and nurses were adamant on convincing me otherwise, as it is a major surgery and there are numerous complications and negatives. i understood that, but i didn't care. they brought in a grief nurse and a social worker to talk to me and they asked me why i wanted a c-section. i tried to explain to them that i didn't want to deliver my dead child. and that i just wanted it over as soon as possible. the grief nurse told me that a natural birth will be a quicker recovery and a c-section will take much longer. she also noted that i could have complications in future pregnancies. so, i decided to have a natural birth.

i was in labor for fifteen hours. i was fortunate enough to have my mother and my best friends by my side. the health providing staff was absolutely amazing. i couldn't have asked for better. they held my hand, cried with me, and took care of me every step of the way. they made a horrible situation a little less horrible and a bit more comfortable. your hospital staff really can have a lasting effect on you and how you perceive an event in your life, and i am so thankful for the care that i received. i still receive cards and notes in the mail from the hospital and it's staff.

i delivered my daughter on august 25, 2018 at 12:21pm. i was blessed enough to hold her one time. she was the most beautiful being i had ever seen in my life. i know that my situation is very different from everyone else's, but i still felt an overwhelming amount of pride that i made her. me. i made that baby. she had thick, black, curly hair, chubby cheeks and the smallest button nose. her face was angelic. i stared at her for what seemed like hours, just soaking up a moment that i would never have with her again. and then i had to let her go, and that was again, one of the hardest things i have had to do in my life.

the hospital made me a memory box with a cast of her feet, her hospital bracelet and other small things. i requested a lock of her hair, and my nurse went down to the morgue just for me for a clipping of her hair. that is true devotion. i am forever grateful for how above and beyond they went to make sure i was as content as i could possibly be, considering the circumstance.  a professional photographer came in and took pictures of my daughter as a condolence. at the end of it all, all i had left of her was a memory box, photographs, and later, her ashes. it will never be enough.

the first night home was the hardest. i held my belly, and it's such a fucked up feeling, because she was gone. my belly was soft, and i just felt empty. 


it has been four and a half months since i lost my daughter, and it never gets easier. grief truly is a rollercoaster that you have to ride. some days it's harder than others. but i am so proud for how far i have come. i have gone back to school, and last semester i earned a's and b's. i am finally at a place, mentally, where i feel fit to return to work. i'm interviewing and trying to get back out there. but everything is different now. i am different now. i'd be lying if i said i didn't miss the person i was before this happened, because she was naive and so innocent. she didn't know true pain. but at the same time, i don't think she could have survived this. i am so much stronger now, and if i can get through this, i can get through anything. 

if i could go back in time and change everything, the only thing that i would change is disposing of that man sooner, and celebrating the life i was growing in my belly. even if things had still unfolded the way they have, i would only wish for the short time that i had with her to be spent peacefully. i was just scared and vulnerable. i will never be that weak again. i talk to my daughter every day and tell her how much i love her.
i believe that everything happens for a reason, and the universe gave me this gift to teach me compassion and true love. without her, i wouldn't know either.

sometimes i am still amazed that i made it out of this trauma alive. i am making it and i don't know how, but i am. i think back to what my life was like then and i truly didn't think i would make it. but here i am to tell this story. 

give your babies an extra kiss for me. 

and if you're wondering, i named her annali.

thank you for reading. ♡

"i pretended to be asleep when i heard my fiance waking up, and i would have never expected what happened next.... whenever my fiance wakes up, i tend to stir a little bit. not enough to wake up fully, but enough to be somewhat coherent.

well, recently, i have been staying awake longer before falling back to sleep, but not really wanting to notify my other half that i'm awake - and i'm so happy i have. 

last week i was coherent enough to realize he had his head rested in front of mine, and was kissing my forehead, stroking my hair and cheek, and softly humming a love song (one that is particularly my favorite and we always listen to it while driving together). i don't know what i did to deserve this man.

this morning, i felt him pull me closer to him, while whispering ""you're the one i've always wanted. i don't know how i got so lucky to be with you. you are the woman of my dreams. i promise to do whatever i can to make you the happiest woman in the whole world."" *boy if i didn't almost snap out of my daze and start making out with him right then!!* instead, i nuzzled myself deeper into my crevasse (my head on his shoulder, while my arm is nestled next to me and my leg over his thigh), to which he pulled me in tighter and i fell right back to sleep.

oh, and he rubs my butt while i'm asleep too apparently, but i'm not going to complain. ;) 

don't just settle for anyone. shoot for the man that's going to tell you how much he loves you - even when he thinks you can't hear him. oh, and someone who loves rubbing your booty. everyone loves a good booty rub. :)

i don't know how long he has been doing this, but given the fact that i've found out about it at least twice in 2 weeks, it makes me feel that this is not his first time. lawdddd, i can't wait to marry this man. 

edit: i just wanted to be clear in the fact that, while some of the comments were negative, i believe i stated that i was coherent enough to be awake. now, that may be a different coherentness for some, but i'm almost to the point of being fully awake. he's also received my consent to rub my booty, and it's not in a creepy stalker ""this ass is all mine"" kind of way, it's more of as him tracing my figure ""gently while trying to remember each curve"" kind of way. he's done it to my while i'm awake lol. if you find that creepy, to each their own. but i'm happy i was able to express my love for someone, through reddit and get such an overwhelming response! also, **i have never read any of the notebook related books, or ever seen any of the movies. nicholas sparks is just not my genre. but again, to each their own.** ☺️

edit: what he whispered to me has been something he's said to me when i was awake. i come from an abusive (mentally and verbally) relationship, and he knows that i need reassuring sometimes. so that's how i was able to capture it all. but thanks for the doubt. :)",11
"the day is finally here and i keep shouting.. i couldn't sleep last night. i woke up to so many texts and messages of love, support and excitement. 

we are getting married today. 

i shouted, ""happy wedding day, babe!"" once i knew he was awake. 

we had our morning smoke and coffee on the porch. as soon as we walked inside, ""we're getting marrrrrriiiiiieeeedddddd today!"" 

all the stress, all the planning, all the frustration, gone. 

i keep randomly shouting with joy. and it is already the best day ever!

edit: thank you for the gold and silvers!!! my husband (eek!) is not a redditor, but greatly appreciates all of the well wishes as much as i do!!!! our wedding went off without a single issue and we had the most amazing day! to address some of the comments - yes, we plan on quitting smoking together in the very near future. and also, weddings are expensive - less expensive on fridays. 
most sincerely yours,
the mrs.",11
"my wife abandoned me and my two small children two months ago. i thought i had lost everything...but i realized i had lost nothing.. six years of marriage unraveled overnight. 

she told me she loved somebody else and she left. took all of her belongings. left behind me and two boys. haven't heard from her since. 

a two year old boy and a four year old boy found themselves suddenly without a mother. me, without a wife and someone i had envisioned myself with until i grew too old to remember. 

alone. 

it hurt. god damn did it hurt. 

my world had fallen apart. dreams and hopes and aspirations all of a sudden out the window. 

i thought i had lost everything. i broke down crying. why did this happen? what did i do? i had tried my hardest...why would she leave us all? 

and then my boys heard me. they came into my room and they hugged me. told me itd be okay. and that's when i realized it would be.

it's funny. 

while i was mourning the loss of her and thinking there was nothing left in the world...i forgot that the only thing that mattered in the world was right there in front of me. my sons. 

you know what? single dad life can work. it will work. 

as long as i have these two wonderful people, i will be happy.

moving on from the lies and deception has been a very enlightening experience. 

i don't know where i'm going with this...but i just needed to vent a little bit.

if it helps anyone going through something similar...please know that you are not alone. it does get better. focus on what matters. don't fight for something or someone who doesn't care.

stay strong.

when you think you've lost everything...realign yourself and see that the things that truly matter are right there in front of you.

edit - wow! thank you all for the outpouring of love and support! i am slowly going through all of these messages. my little ones say good morning! today will be another good day :)

edit dos - thank you all again :) i love reading the comments. it's good to see how many others can relate to what i am going through, and offer advice. i am also glad that this has helped others in a similar situation! if you pmd me, i will respond! slowly but surely!!  

thank you, reddit ❤️ ",11

beat depression or any other mental illness? 

it doesn't matter, it's all yours. 

i don't care who you are, or where you are, if one person can do it, so can you, i believe in you, everyone on reddit believes on you.

"failed my first year of medicine. took it again and ranked 7th among 400 people in my batch. mixed emotions here. med school took a toll in my mental health and led me to depression. for my first year, i just cried most nights, didn't have any motivation to study, cut classes, and contemplated on killing myself because i thought my value was based on my achievements. 

disappointed the hell out of my parents. a lot of scolding and even insults here and there. but guess what? their support never wavered. they sent me again to a different school and always reminded me how much they loved me despite of everything. 

during my (second) first year, i was motivated at first but waves of sadness still came. those regrets and what ifs still haunted me. there were still exams i took without much studying. i still cut classes. i still procrastinate. the difference now is that i sincerely want to become a doctor. i feel like i am now in the right place and in the right time. and i am now working hard for my dreams

i'm taking a study break to write this. my heart is just full. my take away from all of this? it gets better. but you really have to put in some work.

thank you for reading! :)

"i put pennies around the house for my mom to find so she thinks she has good luck.. i was grocery shopping with my mom awhile ago, and she found a penny. she stopped and picked it up, saying she's a little closer to a million dollars. i laughed it off, and called her ridiculous, but i did notice how happy it made her. 
for fun, i put a penny on the floor in the kitchen, and heard her from my room say ""find a penny, pick it up, and through the day you'll have good luck.""

ever since i've been putting pennies around the house, in the drive way, and if we're out i'll casually drop one. she thinks she's the luckiest woman in the world now. the other day, she came up to me excitedly and showed me 5 pennies ""in your face! look how many i've gotten! i have a whole nickel now! it does pay to pick up pennies.""

"my girlfriend of 3 years passed away today and i've never been more relieved.. before you downvote me into oblivion, let me explain what happened. we were together for 3 years and 2 months. she was the love of my life. about 4 months ago, she began to change. she began having seizures which had never ever happened in the past, i assumed maybe she developed epilepsy (not sure if that's even possible, but i hoped it was) but there was also really bad headaches at times and some personality change. i knew something wasn't right, but couldn't figure out what. we instantly called her doctor and got in the next day, she feared the worst and told us to go to er right after, calling to make sure we got in right when we got there. we arrived and the doctor ordered a ct scan and an mri, they showed a large mass in her brain. cancer. terminal cancer. she was given 3 months to live. it was possible she could've lived longer with treatment, but we simply didn't have the money and she decided that she'd die sooner rather than later. over the next four months i just watched as her health deteriorated, i wouldn't ever wish that upon anyone, it's scarred me forever. once she had gotten past the 3 month mark, i was prepared for the worst, she had lasted longer than she was given but she looked awful, she wasn't living or thriving or anything, she was just existing. i knew her final moments were ahead. i had to take so much time off work to be with her, which i'm not upset about, i loved her and was willing to do it but i'm just struggling to make ends meet with rent and car payments for a bit. i spent every possible last moment i could with her. i fell asleep by her side yesterday night, when i woke up this morning, i couldn't wake her. she had ended her battle. i've never cried so much, she was the love of my life, i have endless amounts of respect for people that survive cancer and the families with them every step of the way. i'm relieved because we both knew she was suffering, in endless pain and just surviving, she wasn't living. i never wanted to say goodbye to her, but i know that in the end letting go of her was for the best, she was in too much pain to continue on. i'm starting work again monday, my boss isn't very happy that i missed so much time, i don't know if i'll have the strength to carry on. everyday from here on out is an uphill battle, but i'm going to come out on top, for her, i know her final wishes were for me to be successful and live the best life that i ever could. thank you for all the memories and amazing times jessica, i love you more than anything. 


edit: spelling mistake 

edit 2: thank you for all the kind support everyone, i'm truly speechless, it means more than you could ever imagine. i received a couple dms offering financial support, which i refuse. all i ask is make maybe a small donation to a cancer research or buy a gift for one you love, whether it's a partner, parent, sibling, friend or whoever, show your loved ones you love them and tell them too.  i'll try to reply to comments throughout the day but it's going to be a busy day, jessica's family is driving up here and we're planning the funeral and all that. thank you for all the support everyone. 

edit 3: i doubt anyone still checks this post, but if you do, i've got good news. i quit my old job and started a new one with a better boss and better salary and more flexible hours. i'm still having trouble accepting that all of this happened, but i'm slowly getting there. starting next month i'm seeing a grievance counselor, it's a bit of a far drive but he's very highly rated from what i've read. thank you for all the kind words and support. heres to a new chapter of my life and i hope one day i can make someone as happy as she made me.",11
"my dad (44 yo) passed away today at 6:18pm.. my dad, who was basically a single parent, raised me from birth even though he knew i wasn't biologically his. he never once reminded me of that fact, even though my drug addict mom would remind him when she got drunk and hateful. they separated when i was 3, and i stopped seeing her in the 7th grade. i am an only child. he was always at all of my soccer games, school plays, band concerts, awards nights, anything. he sometimes worked two jobs just to keep us fed. he was my rock. even though our values differed at times, he always knew how to make me laugh and calm me down. all in all, he was a fucking incredible father and stepped up to be my dad when he didn't have to.

i'm now 21 and recently graduated from college as a first generation student with two degrees and i'm lost. my dad made it to my college graduation and was hospitalized the next day for minor strokes. old family friends and school friends and people i don't know are telling me how i am his best accomplishment and how he's so proud of me and how he couldn't have asked for a better daughter. it all really just hurts. i was in the room when he died from an autoimmune disease in the icu. he was hooked up to so many machines since mother's day and i just couldn't do anything. he's been fully sedated basically since he got to the hospital so i didn't get to have a conversation with him for weeks, which was hell because we facetimed at least twice a week while i was at university. my step mom and i finally decided that it was time because of how much he was suffering after both of his lungs collapsed, and at 6:18pm on 6/9/19 he took his last labored breath.

his birthday is on 6/12 and his 8 siblings and their kids and his parents and basically the whole family are getting together to celebrate his life. i'm so numb and empty and all i want to do is run away, but i can't because i need to be strong for myself and my family. my childhood was really fucked, but my dad tried his best to shelter me from all of the pain and nonsense.

i love you so much, daddy. i hope you're more comfortable now.

edit: i didn't find out my dad wasn't my biological father until i was around 10, so he was never my step dad since my mom and dad were never married. i have no idea who my sperm donor is, but my dad will always and forever be my daddy regardless of blood.

also, thank you so much to everyone supporting me during this extremely difficult time. i didn't expect anyone to respond since i wrote this last night before i went to sleep. i appreciate every single person who has taken time out of their life to think about me. much love everyone ❤️",11
"moments before i (24f) commited suicide on sunday, my neighbor unknowingly stopped me. today i found out i'm pregnant after struggling with infertility for three years.. update 2: i went to my ob this morning and unfortunately no ultrasound until wednesday, but all of my vitals were great! i got a referral to a therapist that specializes in women who are pregnant/mothers/struggling with infertility. i see her for the first time on monday! so excited to start this new chapter of my life! for those of who who were asking about my boyfriend, he is doing much better! still bruised a little, but no permanent damage. he's a tough one! thank you wonderful people of reddit! will update again on wednesday! 

update: i want to say thank you to everyone who commented and reached out to me. your words are so beautiful and very appreciated. my whole perspective has changed and i'm on cloud nine. i never expected this post to take off, and i'm trying to respond to all of you, but i'll probably take the next day or so easy. i will update friday after my first appointment, and post pictures if they decide to do an ultrasound! again, thank you beautiful people of reddit. my heart is overwhelmed with love. ❤

original post:

i know the holidays are stressful for everyone, but for some reason december got to me. i gained 15 lbs, my depression sank lower than ever before, and i started to loathe myself. i don't ever remember being that stressed. then, last week, i watched in horror from our parked car as my boyfriend was robbed and beaten. i had a breakdown the next day. sunday rolls around and i was home alone. i was pacing the house and anytime i heard a noise i was terrified. my mind was racing, i started crying and felt like puking. i decided to put it all to an end.

i had every muscle relaxer, sleeping pill, antidepressant, and pain medication i could hold in one hand and shoved them all in my mouth. i was about to wash them down with some water when i heard my neighbor (an older lady who lives alone) knocking and screaming for help.

without hesitation, i spat the pills into the sink and ran to the door. she told me that a large dog was attacking her cat. i followed her to her to her yard and quickly assessed that the dog was simply playing (maybe a little too rough) with the cat. i got the cat back inside and walked the dog back to its owner down the street. after assuring my neighbor that her cat was fine, but recommending she take him to the vet just in case, i went back inside my house. i then realized that i'd just been about to commit suicide. strangely, the urge i'd felt to end my life was gone.

today, after a brief conversation with my boyfriend about my feelings and bodily changes, he suggested i was pregnant. even swore it. i, of course, doubted him. i have pcos, endometriosis, and on top of all that, i was only born with one partial ovary. the chances were astronomical without surgery or hormone therapy, and they would only help a little.

he went and got a pregnancy test, and sure enough, it was positive. we bought two more. both positive. honestly, it explains so much of why my body and mind have been behaving differently. i go to the doctor on friday. 

i don't believe in god, and i don't think fate is real, either. but something in my bones is starting to tell me different. one day i'll thank my neighbor for saving mine and my child's life, because even though that wasn't her intention, that's exactly what she did. ",11
"my boyfriend chewed out his boss yesterday.. when my boyfriend got home last night, he was very on edge and acting strange, so i asked him what happened.

a coworker of his had to leave work early because something happened to his step daughter. after he left, my bf's boss was huffing around the office, complaining that he had left because it wasn't his real kid.

my boyfriend turned to him and said that he would've done the same thing, and if something had happened to our daughter (which is not his by blood) that he would leave as well.

his boss looked him in the eye and said that it's not his kid, and it's not his problem. my boyfriend told him to get fucked and that he had a lot to learn in life, then he clocked out for the day and left.

he then spent the rest of the evening helping to care for our daughter, made dinner, helped me clean up, read her a book and tucked her in.

i'll never understand how i got so lucky, my bf is the most amazing person i ever met. thank you for reading.

edit: thank you all for your support and love! for those wondering, his job is secure and fine. the higher ups of his company know about the interaction and are actually disciplining his boss for his reaction to the coworker who went home because the boss actually tried to stop him from leaving to be with the child in the hospital (even though they aren't blood), and the boss had tried to write the coworker up, not my bf. the boss is a coward and clearly has some of his own issues, and is under review for his own position. they are a man's man type business, so swearing at his boss isn't as looked down upon as other places i guess.",11
"i invented something. i'm a female engineering student, and i got a good position in a pretty competitive internship program this summer. some of my classmates made some comments about how affirmative action probably played a role in my getting chosen over them, so i've had pretty bad imposter syndrome going into this job, was literally crying all the time in the weeks leading up to it because i thought it was a mistake and i was going to do a bad job. 

well this past month i've been working on a side project at work and came up with an idea and developed it, and today i submitted an invention disclosure, so it might become a patent in a few years. i'm really super proud of myself for this, it wasn't someone else's idea that i worked on, it was my own idea that i did all the work for, so no one (not even me) can claim i didn't deserve this. i can't really share this with my friends and family, so i'm just here to say i deserve this job and fuck everyone who told me i didnt.

update a few hours later: damn i'm really blown away by this response! i've seen some people get salty about putting happy things in this sub so i really didn't expect a positive response. thanks so much for silver, i've never gotten any award like that before! 
to people asking about the patent/id stuff: company will own it but my name will be on it as primary inventor and i get a phat bonus if the company lawyers approve it and another bonus if the us patent office approves it. it'll probably take a few years at the us gov level but i'm hoping to return to this company after i graduate so hopefully i'l lsee it through. and sorry, i can't say what the idea is until it reaches the us patent office level, at which point it would be available on google scholar or whatever. hence why i haven't shared with friends/family. and this whole thing still has potential to fail at multiple levels at this point, but i'm just glad to have made it this far before i even turned 22. and i get a free ""inventor"" tshirt. 
thanks so much especially to the fellow engineers and stem folks commenting, your support really means the world.",11
"my bf made me cry just now.... it's been a long day. i'm a teacher and went to the park with my students all day. when i got home i promised to make his favorite thing i cook for his family and a family friend. i was tired so i took a short rest then spent 2 hours cooking. afterwards i knew he's trying to be more active so i went on a walk with him. i have a genetic disorder though and at this point i'm exhausted. i'm showering and there's an earthquake (i'm not used to them). i'm so tired and he sent me to lay down. my feet were swelling. i was hurting.  

he came in and sat on the floor in front of me and rubbed my feet. i started crying. i'm 27 and i've never received that kind care and attention.  he rubbed then for a while, then got lotion and rubbed more. he ran ice packs over them then hot compresses.  i'm laying next to him now talking about avatar the last airbender and i swear this is the man i'm going to spend the rest of my life with. the good guys are out there. ♡",11

"when my girlfriends ex drops their son off he basically has to beg him for a hug goodbye. when i leave for work and forget to say goodbye/don't think he's up yet i get chased down the driveway for a hug.. it feels great and just wanted someone to hear 🙂

edit:

i keep seeing a lot of the same comments so i wanna clarify like 3 things. 

his dad's an mostly uninvolved, selfish asshole who most likely only interacts with his son because my girlfriend has to work and needs him to watch him half the time. he tells us all the time how he would love to spend time with his dad but his dad either sleeps or is out with friends all day leaving his grandparents to take care of his son. i'm almost positive the only reason he seems so involved is to save face. 

i am not trying to make this a competition of love (although i have a pretty good idea who would win that one) or trying to ruin the relationship between him and his father. my parents divorced when i was 7 and i was lucky enough to see how a step father and father should interact in a healthy way for their kids and know how important that is to development. 

i am not by any means trying to replace his dad. i would love for him and his dad to have a great relationship, and even for myself and his dad to be on good terms as well. we all want the same outcome. however if his dad isn't gonna be there for him he needs someone who is. he needs as many people in his corner as possible so until his dad steps up i'm happy to help fill that role.",11
"my (31f) best friend (29f) died in a car crash last night:( my husband (32m) was broken up about it, and so much so, he confessed they had an intense affair last year, they were both in love, but realized it was too complicated.. i can't type much as i have to leave soon and i'm just dealing with so much hurt from all sides that honestly, i'm just numb.

my best friend for the last 10 years, nancy died last night. nancy is one of the sweetest, deepest and cute women i've ever met. she's gorgeous and so artistic and smart, but her life has been a real tragedy from young (i won't get into it here, but let's just say she got into stanford, but her childhood and teen years just ruined her and she never finished college).

she was my closest friend and many many times, she was the one person who showed how much i meant to her.

i'll never forget how she used almost all of her first paycheck to spoil me for my birthday, elaborate vacation getaway, a drop-dead gorgeous cake, meaningful gifts

it's no surprise i wanted my husband who i met 6 years ago (married for 3), to be close to her too. it's odd that he's almost a male version of her. they resemble a lot (which is weird) and often can pass for siblings. they've got very similar personalities too so it's no surprise they bonded easily.



i trusted them fully, i never saw sexual chemistry between them. honestly, they always seem to have a sibling-like friendship.

last year, i had to travel for work for 6 weeks and i suggested my husband and her hangout without me if they got lonely.

that was not endorsing a fucking affair which they ended up having.

--

i woke this morning to see 9 missed calls and dozens of texts. none said she passed, but i knew it was very serious. they were from my other friend and a guy who was dating nancy saying she crashed into a lamp pole coming home. how she was upset and drunk at paul (her boyfriend).

i was shocked, didn't even tell or wake my husband, i called paul who answered and was in tears so i sort of immediately suspected they worse, which i was not ready for.

i can't type this without crying, i will never forget those words he said: ""she's gone, she's not coming back"". i dropped my phone and sort of fainted.

i then started to scream in agony. how? nance was soooo smart, so beautiful, just a wonderful and special person. how?

then my husband immediately came rushing to me and i told him.

he immediately looked so distraught and took his cell phone and flung it away saying, ""fuck it's my fault, fuck"" and he broke down worse than me.



i kept asking him how is it your fault? he kept crying and avoided the question. after 30 mins or so, he calmed down.

he said, i will get mad, i will want to divorce but he has to come clean otherwise he can't live with himself.

he said, last night nancy and he had an argument. i don't know the specifics, but nancy told him she couldn't be with paul because she had feelings for him and paul suspected it. he said, since i was home, he couldn't talk to her properly, but he was texting her a lot (i do remember him frequently going to the bathroom every so often).

apparently, nancy wanted to come over by us and confess everything, even to me. he told her absolutely not to do that. which led to her being abandoned by paul and my husband.

their last text he said was him telling her to stay at the party with paul, instead, she took paul's car, left and drove for 30 mins before crashing into a lamp pole and dying hours later.



i don't know what to feel. i don't know if to be mad at nancy (i can't right now), or my husband.

i know this is messy and new. i will update you guys once things calm down.



but i'm distraught and i don't know how to feel, i need someone to tell me, or advise me on how to move on.

i loved nancy as much as my husband and knowing she was the one who wanted to tell the truth, it helps. but also, knowing she's been lying for so long.

also, my husband is a great guy, he said he was over nancy, but she wasn't. in my heart, i'm thinking why the fuck did you have to hurt her so badly? she was delicate and needed someone to love her fully.



tldr;

my (31f) best friend (29f) died in a car crash last night:( my husband (32m) was broken up about it, and so much so, he confessed they had an intense affair last year, they were both in love, but realized it was too complicated. so confused on how to feel",11

"in the eyes of a less fortunate homeless person. it hurts how people treat and view them in such a way like their less then human.. as i was pulling out of a gas station, i saw a homeless man carrying black contractor bags, dropping them, and going back for the others. 3 guys came up to him and started kicking his bags around and making fun of him. it was raining, he looked helpless and defeated, so i drove right up to him, picked up his bags, and told him to get in the car. i started driving and asked him where he wanted to go. he said somewhere in maryland, we were in virginia, so i told him i could drive him to the metro and pay for his fare. as we were driving, i asked him what kind of music he listened to. i can't remember what it was, but it was very bluesy. as the music was playing, the sky cleared a bit and a rainbow began to show. i saw him out of the corner of my eye gently crying, and my heart wept for him. we got to the metro when everyone was getting back from work. i grabbed his bags and began walking, and it felt like the longest walk of my life. everyone was looking at us like we were pieces of dirt. i wanted to fight every single person that gave us that stupid look. we eventually got to the station, i paid his fare , and we parted ways. when i got to my car i shed a few tears because i realized this is the abuse this man goes through on a daily basis. it wasn't right, it wasn't fair. some people are down on their luck, while some people are in the streets due to addictions or other circumstances. at the end of the day, they're all human. don't treat them like they're any less than that. a lot of the people who treat them as sub-humans are a paycheck away from being homeless themselves. be humble and have compassion for your fellow human beings, please.

edit: wow my first platinum! thank you sir for this really made my day

edit: thank you for all the kind words and support you guys have given. remember to give back to those less fortunate. a small act you give can be huge to that person.",11
"your mom and i found your stash of heroin last night. she left your room intact, even the wrinkles on the bed from the last time you lay there.  the only thing she added was the urn that contains your ashes.  

but she's moving and i was helping her pack.  i knew about the secret compartment in your desk.  it was my desk when i was your age.  it was my mom's desk when she was your age.  

i kept weed in there when i was your age.

it was the first time your mom and i had ever seen heroin.  i gave you nine wrinkled dollars on the day you died.  the coroner gave us your wallet with those nine dollars in it.  i was glad to know that i didn't pay for the heroin that killed you.  

but it was hard looking at those little bags.  

three or four times a day, i think about something that would interest you, or something i'd like to ask your opinion about.  sometimes i even pick up the phone.

anyway, i miss you.  i wish things had worked out differently.

i wish that we had had more time.",11
"my wife suggested polyamory to alleviate her guilt for cheating. it's hard to know where to begin.

in november of last year, i came home and pulled my wife out of a tub. she attempted suicide with our child  in the house. thankfully, our child slept through the attempt, the cops and the paramedics.

this attempt would lead to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, psych ward stays, partial hospitalization programs, and a complete disruption to both our lives. my wife has been unable to work since the attempt and for a long stretch needed constant care. it was exhausting working, taking care of her, and taking care of small child. and, because of the stigma of this type of thing, before i sought therapy i didn't tell my employer or anyone really.

now my family knows about the suicide attempt and some of my coworkers but very few people know the full story.

at the time of the attempt, my wife and i were several months into trying a somewhat open relationship. my wife suggested earlier in the year opening our relationship. she was bisexual and had grown up in a fairly conservative home. while we were pretty sexually open with each other, we never considered an open relationship. she said she wanted it to explore being with women—a side of herself she never examined. i wanted to be supportive since i know she felt repressed by her parents. the deal was essentially we could both try it with her limiting herself to women (her suggestion) and the rule was we informed each other.

my wife met one woman she dated casually for a few months. i dated one woman for a few weeks and then met another woman. things seemed fine. a few jealous occasions but nothing of note.

but then my wife became depressed. this wasn't unusual. she suffered from depression from time to time. it was usually triggered by weeks away from home which she occasionally did. well, this usual depression turned into a long, deep depression that didn't go away. flash forward to the attempt. my wife suggested she did it out of jealousy of the second woman i met.

i called it off and dove into the long process of taking care of my mentally ill wife. i was racked with guilt even though she knew and condoned every aspect of this other relationship. my wife would often guilt me. tell me i wasn't working hard enough. she would get mad about things that seemed completely irrational and i would chalk it up to the bipolar. i went to her therapy sessions, my therapy sessions, and couples therapy sessions. i was working very hard at this. 

i was also falling apart from all the things i was balancing.

and then one day, she called me as i was leaving work and told me i needed to hurry home because she would harm herself. when i got there prepared to take her to the hospital again, she finally told the truth. i'm not sure what finally snapped that made her do it but i'm eternally grateful it happened. 

she calmly explained that she had cheated on me more than two years prior with a man during one of her periods away from home. that he actually called the affair off. she says in hindsight she believes she was manic at the time. she explained that opening the relationship made her feel less guilt because it allowed me to sleep with other women. she confessed she was eventually going to try to open the relationship to men. i can't explain what this all meant to me. the incalculable lies this immediately made me realize she told. the manipulation she used. 

but here was this woman i had been waiting on hand and foot for months now, who hadn't brought in a single paycheck, who seemed to resent my care, who guilted me at every turn now telling me she had an affair.

i've left her now. we are selling the house. i'm moving on and i've met someone who treats me kindly. but i wanted to get this off my chest.",11
"i used to be a neo-nazi who should have been punched in the face.. the 'punch nazis' trend, and people saying 'no don't do that', lately has brought up one of the most shameful aspects of my life. 

once upon a time, many years ago, i was a neo-nazi. as a teenager, i got involved with a guy who also considered himself a neo-nazi and i wound up with a swastika scratched into my leg that fortunately has left virtually no scar. unsurprisingly, this was a horribly unhealthy relationship for 17yr old me to be in and it didn't last long. a few years later i dated another guy, and his girlfriend. he was a neo-nazi, and his girlfriend was jewish, and he got off on having a jewish girl willing to basically pull a 'night porter' with him. that too, unsurprisingly, was a very unhealthy relationship and was over very fast.

but how, why did i get sucked into that life? quite simply, i was raised by racist parents. parents who, though they've much improved in their views since my younger years, instilled in me the same racism and prejudices they held, all with the classic phrase of 'but we're not raicst.' no matter how rebellious i was in everything from religion to sub-culture to music to w/e, i never felt a need to rebel against that because it had been a part of my life on such a passive, natural level. as i became an adult and became more aware of the world around me and actually studied (after some help) and educated myself, i began to see that what i was buying into, or at that point at least not rebelling against, was fucked up. yet it was still hard to overcome, because hatred and pride are so, so easy to get sucked into. 'misery loves company' and there is a lot of misery in the world of white supremacists, so there's plenty of people to pull you down while making it seem like they're holding you up. 

ultimately i met someone who was willing to challenge me on absolutely everything and force me to think for myself. every view i presented was questioned harshly, meanly, and time and time again my views that aligned with racism and nazism were demolished with logic. soon this logic enabled me to realize 'holy fuck, i have been a huge idiot, this is wrong' (to say the least) and the same cognitive dissonance that set in with my 'religious epiphany' began regarding human compassion. in that moment i swore i would not be party to those views again.

looking back on it, were it not for the fact that i am a: rebellious, b: open to learning new things, and c: had someone willing to be a patient asshole with my stubborn bigotry, there is a chance that even now (i'm 28) i would not have overcome those viewpoints. shy of someone literally punching me in the face, of someone blatantly and rudely standing up to me, i'd have carried on like i was right to hold those prejudices and ideologies. 

and from what i knew/know of people who identify as 'nazis' or 'alt-right' or 'fascists' or whatever fucking label they're trying to put on their idiocy... they're terrible people. the vast majority of whom are completely unwilling to entertain the idea they're wrong. it doesn't matter how eloquent you are, how patient you are, how peaceful you are, probably 98% of them will not listen and will not change their minds. there is something about the comradery of that hatred and pride that is more addictive than heroine. and that 2% that might be willing? they'll branch out on their own, secretly, and entertain those ideas. but that 2% isn't worth holding back. 

now we have the trend of punching nazis. and i love it. i love the fact that i love it, because a decade ago, i'd have been offended because i'd be a target. and yeah, punching their lights out may only serve to close their minds further, but, it does in fact teach them to keep their nonsense to themselves and not spout it publicly, and that they aren't safe if they do. so, i just can't get behind the idea of 'no, you can't do that, it's just more violence!' because i've been there and know that's the language they speak, that i once spoke; it was the language i best understood at the time.

if i met 17 year old nazi-me today, i'd punch myself in the face. and i'd have deserved it. 

thanks for reading, reddit. and also, to everyone who has ever been persecuted by fascists, neo-nazi's and the 'altright' or straight up racists... i'm sorry. i can't apologize for them, but i still apologize for anything and everything i ever did to add to that grief. 


**edit** well. this got a bit popular. i'm trying my best to answer questions and messages! the biggest question i've gotten in messages has been about how to address people who are racist/involved in white supremacy to help turn them around (without just punching them in the face.) 

my advice on this, and what worked with me, was knowing logical fallacies as my 'mentor' who guided me out of the cave did. and he was a relentless asshole granted, i was already open to new things and to learning, and without that it would have been a futile effort. one has to be open to and aware of the notion of cognitive dissonance for it to have a positive impact, otherwise they will just run further into the cave out of fear. however, if they are open to it, ask what their views are. do this several times without criticizing or affirming, just do it to understand. then go back and each time you speak with them, point out their lapses in logic: ""but that's post hoc... you're basing that on false equivalence... don't strawman' and explain what those are. this took months and also my mentor convinced me to travel a bit with him on his dime. like, he went above and beyond what most people could ever do. he helped to physically remove me from that life for a short time, but while someone is immersed in it... it's daunting, and it's going to take a very long time. i wish i could give you a more positive, instant-gratification answer, but that's been my experience and that's what i can convey best. 


**edit edit** i understand many of you don't advocate violence/are against the notion of punching people in the face even though they are literal nazis/think violence isn't the answer... and you're welcome to that view. however, i was met with those views time and time again, and they didn't work. being a woman, i seldom was the one attacked (sexism is a thing everywhere and in many directions... but that's another issue) but my male counterparts were, and they deserved it. that's what shut them up, that's what pushed them back into the shadows. yes, i am living proof that you can crawl out of that hole without that physical violence, but i also know how much of an anomaly that is (also that the verbal skirmishes with my mentor were far more painful and filled with far more rage than a fist to the face). you can accept the testimony of myself, and others who have posted here who've dealt with this lifestyle first hand, and consider it, or don't. that's up to you. i've posted this to simply express my experience and how i'll choose to deal with it if needed. 

**edit edit edit** holy gilding batman! thank you! and regardless of the mixed responses, even the harassing ones, i appreciate the conversation this has started and the insights that have been shared here.

"today i did my laundry, cleaned my car, room, and bathroom, and bought groceries for the first time in months.. those seem like the most basic, mundane tasks, but as i've come to find out over the past few months, it's extremely easy to slip into an overwhelming sense of, just— blah. i don't know how or when that feeling took over me, but today something changed. i decided i was tired of my personal life reflecting what my brain felt like. there was no clarity, there was no joy it seemed, and waking up every day felt like a chore. i have no idea what clicked in my brain or why it did, but today i woke up and decided i was tired of the clutter. i was tired of everything in my life looking and feeling so messy. i bought healthy food after pretty much exclusively eating fast food, and i'm planning on going back to the gym this week. getting emotional and excited about these tiny accomplishments seems so weird, but i am and i wanted to let everyone know!

edit5: thank you for third silver and gold, lovely kind strangers! your support means the world to me. sending you hugs and endless love and happiness your way! 

i can't answer all of your replies and questions but i'm very grateful for the overwhelming support! 

here's a brief history to my mom's cancer, as some of you were curious! 

1. what stage cancer had my mom? 
she was stage ii, possibly stage iii (that was prior the biopsy). after the first biopsy came back, she was reduced to stage ii. after the excision, and the termination of the tumors, her final diagnosis is that she is stage 0. 

2. when did the doctors find it? follow-up question: how fast did she beat it?
they found it pretty early on, which is why she recovered so fast from it and no other tumors were found in her lymphs, lungs, etc. they found it at the beginning of may. her first diagnosis was that she had a cyst in her left breast. after getting a second opinion and a second round of tests, they found out it was indeed cancer. three big tumors and around fifteen more but significantly smaller were found in her left breast. doctors estimated that these tumors were around two or three years old. by some miracle, last year she hit her breast and because of the injury the tumors have grown in size but not in power, so this is why it was easier for them to find the cancer. 

3. is there a possible origin or a reason for the cancer?
yes. apart from the injury that helped us find out she had these tumors growing in her, we also have a long history of cancer, originating from my mom's side. my grandmother (my mom's mom) died of breast cancer. she was stage iv, her tumors were growing in her for at least a decade before any symptoms showed up. bad luck, to say the least. my mom's brother - my uncle - died of skin cancer. their grandmother also died of breast cancer. needless to say, i also carry the cancerous gene. i do have some irregularities in my left breast, but so far they're benign and don't require excision. they're stage 2 in growth (bi-rads 2, for those who can read echograph results). for now, both my mom and i are good. my daughters - if i am to have any - would possibly carry the gene as well.

4. what was her surgery?
excision of her left breast and a lymph under her arm. she has around thirty stitches but she's doing extremely well. she's a warrior! 

5. what happens now? what is her follow-up treatment?
chemotherapy or radiotherapy is absolutely unnecessary in her case. however, she will go through a hormonal treatment for five years. during this time, she will visit biannually cancer specialists to check if there are tumors starting to grow again in her other breast, as this type of cancer tends make the breasts mirror each other. 

here's a piece of advice from me. if you are a woman who has had a child, and breastfed them - go through a yearly check with a cancer specialist, and if you have family history of some type of cancer, no matter the gender - do so biannually. cancer is an awful disease that still has no definitive cure, so please take care of your health - your family and friends need your support and love; you are needed. :)",11
"i stood up to my abusive (ex)stepdad which resulted in me getting slapped in the face.. this happened last week on wednesday.

i'm 19 and got my very first tattoo last week. it was planned for quite some time and i've been saving for it so i was super exited that i finally could get it done.

my mom and, now ex, stepdad aren't really fans of them but my mom always said that when i turned 18 i could do whatever i wanted to my body so that's what i did.

i was a bit resilient about telling them at first but i figured that they would know eventually so i decided to jusr tell them and see. i was afraid though of how my stepdad would react since i can never do something right in his eyes. for example, the forks and spoons have to be in the right direction in the drawer, my mom can't exit the room or else he'll ask ""where are you going?"", i shouldn't drink any alcohol since it isn't ""lady like"" ect...

i never respond to him since i don't like pointless arguments. we are both very stubborn so when we do get in an argument it usually lasts for a couple of days. my mom always tries to get between us and calm the whole thing without much success and i don't want to cause her stress so i keep my big mouth shut and suck it up.

he's kind of a hoarder, he buys everything that he doesn't need which results in several rooms in our house being trashrooms. last year he got scammed however into buying these ""super fancy, high end"" cooking pots which cost €2000! for 5 pots!! of course my mom was pissed when she found out, even more so since they weren't actually high end. just normal ones. i'm not supposed to know this but my mom told me and asked me to keep it secret.

how is this all relevant to you getting slapped though? well let me get to it now.

so we sit at the table, eating dinner and i decide to tell them about my new tattoo. my stepdad is sitting at the head of the table, me and my mom at each side next to him.

my mom wasn't very happy about it but she didn't make a big deal about it. my stepdad however, he was furious.

""when did you get this done? how much? why would you ever do that?"" and so much more. i answer all his questions while shaking. i knew he would be mad but i didn't think it would be this bad.

""€250"" i tell him. his jaw dropped.
""did you spend so much money on that?? are you out of your mind? do you know what you could've done with all that money??""

oh here it comes.

i was done. i've lived under the same roof with that man for over 10 years and i just couldn't keep my mouth anymore.

""you're right. next time i'll be more thoughtful and buy cooking pots worth over €2000 instead""
i said in a very sarcastic way.

oh god, what have a done.

he got up and next thing i knew, i got his hand right on my left cheek. mind you, he's not a weak, small man. that slap hurt! he was absolutely furious.

i start to cry and looked over at my mom. oh god, you should've seen the rage in her eyes. she got up, threw her plate in my stepdad's direction and started to scold him, she used all names that probably existed. my stepdad realising what he had just done, sits down and starts apologising to her. she didn't take any of it and basically dragged him outside. it was like a demonic entity had entered her body. just picture a raging italian mom right after one of her babies got hurt by the hands of someone else. i had just gotten slapped hard but i couldn't do anything else than to enjoy this sight.

they were now outside screaming at each other which attracted all the neighbours of course. after a good 10 minutes of arguing, my mom ordered him to leave and he did. the day after he could come and pick his bags.

i must say that i felt very guilty at first for being the reason they broke up and affording things will be harder now but i'm very glad that i'm free of him. home feels like heaven now.

sorry if this was a long post, thank you for making it this far.

"to the guy i sold a laptop to at bestbuy. it was your first gaming laptop, you where a young fella, 2 kids, and your wife was pregnant. you had a gaming rig, but you wanted something on the go. it was getting pretty late, and i could see your wife struggling with the baby and trying to sit down anywhere she can.

i personally don't want to get married, and having biological kids is not my style, but if you are married, and she is pregnant, give her some dam attention mate, i didn't even want to sell it to you. she was standing there and you where asking me all these questions about financing and such.

the store was about to close, and she came up while you where paying,

""what's taking so long?""

""we are almost done, i know its getting late"" he said

""i wanted to go out tonight""

he shrugged.

for fucks sake she is carrying your child, she was already tendering to the kids, give her some love, some attention. i wouldn't want this, but if i already have a wife, and she is pregnant, i would be damned if i didn't go out of my way to try to make life as easy on her as possible.

she wants to go out with you, she want's your company. we aren't selling out on these, and even if we did, she comes first.

i genuinely wanted to kick you out, and not sell it to you

just please fellas, pregnancy is brutal, at least during this time, give them undivided attention.

edit: maybe i didn't make this clear. i understand this was only 30 minutes i had with this family, but during this, the mother literately sat on the wooden floor in a bestbuy. imagine the scene, you walk into a bestbuy, you see a pregnant lady, as far as i know, trying to breathe, 2 kids running around, and a father talking to a sales person about his new laptop.

"my wife and i had to go out of state because our own state is fucking backwards. new account because i don't want this on my regular account.  my wife and i were trying for kids for a while and ended up having to use fertility medication.

good news, got pregnant, bad news, was a lot more than we could handle.  we were told we had to go out of state to get the number of fetuses reduced to a more reasonable number.

so we did, but along the way my wife gets told by shit people what a terrible person she is.  people on the internet, people at work, people she thought she could trust.  it's shit and i can't do anything to help her except be there for her.

it's shit like this that makes you realize who your true friends are.  it's everyone who realizes you're not supposed to judge other people because that's between them and whatever fucking deity is making them feel morally superior.  if you're going to tell someone they're a baby murderer because that's what your fucking priest is telling you to say then go fuck yourself, also that's a sin too but don't let that stop you.

let me reiterate, when someone has to go through an abortion, they don't make that decision lightly.  you don't know what the fuck someone has had to go through to even get to that point.

we were lucky we had the money to go through with this because it wasn't fucking cheap.  it's a shit situation for poor people who are stuck in backwards fucking states.

basically all i want to say is stop hating women and stop hating poor people and maybe we can make this shit work, america.  leave abortion the fuck alone and let people have the right to make their own choices even if you don't agree with that.  and if you don't agree that people should be able to make their own choices then maybe you need to take a long look at the pile of shit you see in the mirror.

today at home, she left her phone unlocked and i saw a video with our family photos as a cover. i got curious and played it. 

and guess what, the annoying little song started playing.

i do drive a bit slow. you've never said anything about it, but i usually have a lead foot so it's a bit unlike me. yes, i want to be safe. but also, i just want to spend more time with you. if i drive 80 down the highway, i'll get to where we need to be quicker which means less time listening to music and talking with you. it's a nice feeling and i just want to spend every moment i can with you. 

it's not much, but it's honest work.

"sometimes i text my dead cousin to update her about her son.. we were raised so close that we were closer to each other than our own respective sisters. she developed a drug problem when she turned 13 and was in and out of rehab for the next 10 years. she got sober 8 years ago and met a guy, they had a beautiful baby boy and things really seemed like they were on the upswing. she was 6 years sober but od'd the month before her wedding. thankfully they resuscitated her and she was checked into rehab. i was the only cousin (out of 19) who called her while in rehab. we talked about everything, her son, her love of life, her trust of the program, her love of everything in texas. she and i became close again for the first time in years.

a few months ago my mom called me in the middle of the day to tell me that she had died. she od'd and i have never felt my heart hurt that badly in my entire life.

fast forward to last week when our entire family got together, including her son and baby daddy. her son was so full of love, laughter, and joy, i started to cry. he is every good thing about my cousin. i was overwhelmed and didn't know how to deal so i grabbed my phone and texted her. i wrote, ""you picked a fantastic father for your son. your son is at the family reunion and having an absolute blast. i promise to make sure they always feels the family love and support. i miss you.""

since then, i had a dream about her where we just sat an talked and when i woke up it felt like i had lost her all over again.

apologies if this isn't the place to write this but i really just needed to tell someone this. i'm overwhelmed with grief. i miss her so much. i wish she hadn't died. heroine sucks.",11
"my boyfriend and bacterial vaginitis saved my life.. a few months ago i started seeing my current boyfriend. everything was great, we have so many shared interests and he really has his life together. about a month into our relationship he made a comment on the smell of my vagina. this is where the story gets really embarrassing and why i need to post it anonymously online. he commented that i may have bacterial vaginitis and asked if i'd had a pap smear yet. 

being the big immature baby i can be sometime i went full embarrassed panic mode and told him i need a break. well we got back together and he told me i should see a doctor for real. i schedule an appointment and wow i do have bacterial vaginitis but also a really abnormal pap smear. 

i've been going to see the doctor almost weekly until 3 days ago my biopsy results came back and i have stage one cervical cancer that can likely be cured with cryosis and has not spread to my lymph nodes. i caught it so early. had it not been for him i could've had this tumor growing in me for years. 

the day i was diagnosed i was also fired from my job because someone came in with a fake id and i served them. this is the most terrified and depressed i've ever been in my life but i guess i just have to get off my chest how supported i feel by him and my group of friends and family. also that getting bacterial vaginitis saved my life which is kind of funny. 

edit: everyone that's been supportive thank you so much! to everyone asking why we broke up and why i didn't go to the doctor initially it was a brand new relationship and i had had no vaginal issues previous to us having unprotected sex (on birth control) sometimes semen can throw your ph out of wack and give you bacterial vaginitis. i only had abnormal smell during sex. i was embarrassed to face a very intimate issue with a new partner and was unsure if i could feel sexy in front of him again. i'm aware of my own immaturity and have owned up to it. in addition i had no insurance and just got back on my parents. 

regardless, the internet has trolls and i will feed you so suck my cancer riddled vagina ass hats thank u!",11
"to the marine veteran who answered my suicide hotline call tonight.... when i called you, i was hyperventilating and the only words i could muster were ""i can't breathe."" i was contemplating cutting myself and i was beginning to have schizophrenic thoughts of hurting myself to make the pain stop.

my marine husband went missing for 3 hours and he wasn't picking up the phone. he didn't answer his texts. he said ""i'm headed home"" hours ago and never showed up.

i've stayed up crying because this is the second night in the row he did this. last night, it was a fluke and he stayed at work way too late. he was livid that i called the police because he thinks he's invincible.

tonight, it happened again. he didn't come home. i paced. my schizophrenia and bipolar were agitated, conjuring up voices and hallucinations to feed my paranoia. my arms burned, itching for me to relapse and cut myself. 

you asked me to calm down. asked my name. where i lived. if i had children.

yes, i do. two little boys- ages 3 and 6. they're a handful. they're also sick with the flu. i also have a bunch of baby chickens, a handful of cats, and a dog. 

we talked about my work. my time in the service. how i met my husband. you did everything to distract me and you made me laugh. 

for the first time in months, someone took care of me.

you talked to me for an hour. you listened to me ramble about my rape trauma. i opened up my deepest darkest secrets like it was some floodgate. as if i've waited my whole life for someone to fucking ask me, ""what's wrong?""

i couldn't stop.

but you listened. you asked questions. you repeated what i said back to me. you really listened and that meant the world to me.

you told me you wanted to be a therapist someday and this is a stepping stone for you. god, you're going to make an amazing therapist someday. i believe in you.

before the call ended, you came up with a plan with me on what to do if my husband came home and what to do if he didn't. i needed that. i was told exhausted to think of it myself.

i felt so much better after our call. you truly pulled me away from a potentially horrible schizophrenic episode. and you lifted me up. you praised me for all i do. you told me i must be superwoman. i felt noticed. i felt like i mattered. i felt like i was worth something. 

my husband ended up coming home after taking care of a few underage drinkers. he's selfless like that... he takes care of people. he just forgets to take care of me sometimes- hence he didn't call when plans changed.

i went through his phone with his consent, to verify the story. it was true. we sat down and had a conversation. i told him he couldn't just vanish like that. he apologized. 

tomorrow, we'll talk some more.

it's 4:15am now... it's been a few hours since our phone call. but thank you.

thank you so much.

you saved a life tonight.

"cuddling for the first time. so last night my guy friend stayed over with me. we gamed most of the night. chatting back and fourth. after a short while i moved a pillow to the middle of the couch and leaned on his arm. for the next few hours we gamed and bullshitted. well he got tired decided to go to bed. i went out and was watching my phone. about twenty minutes later he comes out and talks about how he can't sleep. we chat. he goes back to the bed and calls me in, we look at memes and shit. well my hand brushes his arm and he tells me how i'm like an ice cube and he proceeded to give me the blankets. slowly getting closer. i moved my leg on top of his and he eventually wrapped around my waist and we laid there. switching positions every so often.

i never really paid attention to his little comments before and i don't exactly know what this means. but it was my first time cuddling with someone. and i wanted it off my chest
(edited typo)


update: he is attracted to me, he wants to meet up and talk about soon.

update no. 2: were gonna go on a dinner date this week, talk about it then. we both want to cuddle more

update no. 3: we're still good friends! after the date we met up and cuddled a couple more times, we both agreed that we didn't exactly want a relationship but both wanted a platonic cuddle buddy. he's gotten a girlfriend now and i'm beginning my own relationship. but we still meet up often and just relax.",11

"i'm not getting paid. i'm one of 400,000 federal government employees not getting paid. it breaks my heart when i hear people sneer at my branch and say that ""i'm not a real member of the military."" i went to boot camp. i am the same rank as someone in the navy. i have saved lives. yet people don't understand that i can't wait for back pay when i have a car payment, rent, insurance amongst others. i've got bills that are literally piling up because of this furlough. i'm up to my eyeballs in stress and worry because our government wants to fund a bullshit wall. 

i haven't been this anxious in months. i literally wake up every morning with my stomach in knots. i don't sleep very well, and when i do, i have awful nightmares of getting my car taken away or getting evicted. people don't understand how much this hurts me, a little e-4 who is just making enough to get by. i am scared, honestly. i have a dollar fifty to my name right now because of this shutdown and it frightens me. 

i'm terrified right now and i just want this nightmare to be over. i'm tired of all this. 

*edit* i am completely and utterly humbled by the support and the kind words that people have offered me. i am sitting here with tears in my eyes because i am so grateful to each and every one of you who have whispered positive things from your corners of the internet. 

i should also mention that i don't care if you're a republican, democrat or nestled somewhere in between. right now, the blame falls on our government as a whole. a lot of you have been asking what you can do to help. write to your congress representative and tell them that your friendly neighborhood nordy is struggling to make ends meet. the coast guard also has food pantries set up around the country right now and they need non-perishables, pet food and other amenities right now. please let me know if you want to donate to these causes. i am not here looking for a handout, but to make my voice heard for those who are voiceless in this situation. 

thank you all so much. i am forever honored by your words of encouragement.

"virginity doesn't exist.. i recently saw a news article about how t.i. takes his daughter to have her ""virginity"" checked with a gynecologist. ‬

‪i read how wrong it was and abusive it was‬. i broke down in tears. 

it dug up a lot of feelings about my teen years. 

my own father has used this tactic against me when i was 16. i was dating someone he didn't like (and frankly he shouldn't have liked him, but that's beside the point), and he confronted me, interrogating me and asking if i had sex with my boyfriend. i had, but i wouldn't say. he confronted me for hours, screaming at me, willing me to answer that i had, despite my rejection. 

my mom didn't offer any support, just watching it all unfold. 

he threatened that, since i claimed that we hadn't had sex, he would take me to my gynecologist and he would ""check"" me for my ""virginity"".

i broke down, and finally fessed up. the idea of someone ""checking"" me, and giving that information to my father felt far more humiliating than just admitting it. 

he stormed off into the basement, and stayed there for the rest of the night. i knew that's where he kept his gun, and he started screaming that he would kill him. i didn't feel like he actually would (and he, of course, didn't) but his reaction scared me. 

i tried to get the comfort i needed from my mother, crying and shaking. i remember crying ""he hates me"". even in that moment i just wanted my dad to not be mad at me anymore. my mom just told me to not be dramatic and to go to my room. 

i did. my dad had taken my phone. so i just stewed all night. i thought about killing myself. i thought that i just wanted this all to end, because i couldn't stand feeling like i did anymore. ashamed. afraid. betrayed. a disappointment to my dad. 

i went into school the next day. i told my close friends in my drama club what happened. i said that i hated my dad, and in that moment i did. they told me how terrible it was. one friend kept insisting that he was a terrible person and father. 

and i defended my father. in one breath i hated him and the next i was protecting him. i snapped at my friend and told him that he can't talk about my dad that way. i said that he was just trying to protect me. 

my dad told me that so many times. 

i didn't realize until much later that what he did was abuse. i'm in therapy, and i thought that i'd moved past that trauma, a lot of the trauma i experienced. but healing isn't linear, and sometimes it flares up. 

i have a better relationship with my dad now. he's worked on being a better father to me, and to my brother. he's apologized without excuses and made changes. i've forgiven him. but clearly it's not something i'll forget, and i'll bare those memories forever. 

you aren't devalued by having sex.

no one has a right to your sexual history except you. 

you own your body. 

virginity doesn't exist.

edit: thanks for the silvers and golds, anonymous gilders! ❤️

i've read every single one of the comments, and will continue to read them. your stories and your words mean a lot to me, and i'm glad that it's sparked some conversation. 

i wanted to say that my life is significantly better now, and my relationship with my dad is truly on the mend. it was hard for a while, and i had to put a lot of distance between us. but over time, it's gotten better. 

i mention this a little below, but the guy i was with at the time was not good to me. he was sexually coercive, manipulative, and controlling. i think my dad knew that to a certain extent, but he did not handle it well, which essentially forced me deeper into that relationship when i had no one to turn to. 

i was trapped for many years. however, i'm in a much better place now. i just got married to an amazing person, and i'm in a truly happy and healthy relationship. 

everything takes time. i mean it when i say it truly does get better.

"i've done all the things i had on my 'stuff to do before i kill myself' list. i made that list about three years ago. it had stuff like 'i want to see all my favorite bands live', 'i want to read this book when it comes out', 'i want to know how got ends', 'i want to become a really good dancer', 'i want to go to vegas and gamble'. pretty simple things, because back then i was really struggling to find anything at all that would keep me motivated to stay alive just a little bit longer. 

and now, well- today i realized it's all been done. i finished the list. got is over (let's not talk about it). i've read that book and many more. i saw all my favorite bands live at festivals and concerts. i'm on my way to being at least a decent dancer. i won like 300 bucks on slot machines in vegas (it was a good trip). 

but now there's new movies to wait for. new music coming out (august 30th!!). new books to read. new travel destinations. new friends i hang out with who i didn't even know back when i made the list, but who i adore and don't ever want to lose. 

it feels a bit weird. but good. and i'm excited for all that will come!",11
"the meaning of ""if you love someone let them go"" and why i was abandoned as a child. since the age of 12, my father abandoned me at a train station to go back to live with my mum, no more seeing him every school holidays, he never said why and never told my mum why. he was an alcoholic and smoker. today, after 10 years of waiting, i finally was able to find someone who knew his current phone number. we spoke for 3 hours, he told me that he never stopped loving me and that he has prayed that i am well in life. he than began to explain what had happened over the past 10 years, heavy, king-pin drug dealing, alcoholism, heavy drug use, in and out of jail, abusive, prostitutes, the type of guy that's worse than a gang leader, just literally pure hatred and did anything to stop feeling the pain from his own childhood. 

he has told me that the day he left me at that train station he never had been more upset and did not want to do it but said that i would have been domestically beaten up if i ever was the slightest bit out of line, into selling drugs, smoking, alcohol, prostitutes, a ""drug fucked loser"" as he says. so in saying this today i learned that no matter what kind of relationship, romantic or family, it's not as simple as if you love them, you'll let them go, it is actually if you love them enough, you will not put them through trauma or put yourself through trauma, you'll let them live a good life.

&#x200b;

i could have been in and out of jail, and the toughest, meanest, abused, drug fucked idiot if my father did not do what he did, and for that i am thankful, i am the complete opposite of that, long story short i save people's lives everyday and study hard to save more people's lives. i am writing for this for all the people abandoned by their parents, partner, wife/husband, child, love of your life. sometimes there are reasons and those reasons will only destroy you if you stay, sometimes abandonment is the only way. my father sought out all help, every professional, years of therapy before hand but the only thing that saved him is being born again and becoming religious after almost dying 3 times , yes literally, and if that's what helped than so be it, i love him a lot",11

after i went into the mental hospital, i bought some of my favorite plants to grow. however, i was depressed to the point of not even leaving my bed again.

my life took a downturn for a while and all of my plants started to wilt and die. my lemonbalm turned black, and my only tomato that had grown had a hole in it. even though they were plants, i was crushed.

i gave up on them up until today. today i finally got a job after searching for one for so long, i went out there to see how they were, and...

they're coming around. 5 tiny baby tomatoes have popped up, a jalapeno has, and my lemonbalm has bright new sprouts.

i repotted them all and gave them some plant food.

i know they're just plants, but i'm glad they're okay.

maybe things are getting better.",11
"i got a compliment today on a thing that i am insecure about and it feels amazing!. i am a dark skinned girl living in a country which places white skinned people on a pedestal and looks down on people with even slightly dark skin tone. 

since i am very dark skinned, i tend to avoid wearing bright colors like white and yellow because they make me look even more darker.

however, i wore a white blouse today which i bought because it was so pretty that i just couldn't pass it up. i thought that even if it may not look good on me, it's still a good looking top and so i just wore it to work.

and a co-worker complimented me! she said ""that top is really cute and white looks awesome on you!""

i turned into a puddle. 
i am feeling good about myself ever since.

guys, please just wear whatever you want! if you like it, you should wear it! don't be so insecure that you might miss something good!",11

"i'm a single, childless woman in her mid-30s who had cats. i should be pathetic, right? but i got to do something today that i'd never be able to do with husband and children, and fuck it feels good.. a good friend of mine was randomly widowed a couple years ago. she hit a bad spot recently, so i wired her a few hundred dollars. 

and you know what? i didn't have to ask anyone before i did it. i just did. it's my money, so it affects no one but me. 

i've been married before, so i know what it's like to have to constantly run money decisions past a spouse. 

but i'm single, so no one gives a damn. i can help my friend without justifying it to anyone. 

i'm definitely a ""career gal."" i'm on the local board of directors for our professional organization, and i teach night classes for my field at the local college. i'm employed at one of the more prestigious companies in the area for my field. 

i've been able to throw myself into my career because husband and children have not been a thing. 

and i can throw money at a friend who's hurting and think nothing of it.

"6 hours ago, i stopped myself from committing suicide.. i walked to a park near my neighborhood around 10 at night, swung on the swings, then sat in an empty field with my pocket knife in my hands. i cried. a lot. i thought about my life and all the things going wrong, and cried some more. i thought about my daughter, and how i would be putting her through the pain i went through not having a father. i thought about her growing up without a father like me. i thought about how she would move on and pick herself up, and be better than i ever was. i thought about how her life would be better without me. i thought about my mom and how she would hate me, and rightfully so. i thought about how she'd take in my daughter and give her an amazing life like she gave me and my sister. then i thought about my sister and how strong she is. how she would pick up the pieces of my family after i'm gone and save everyone else. i thought about my best friend and how he would lose a part of himself, but fill it with something better than me. how he would do everything in his power to pick up my slack. i thought about my boyfriend and how he would wonder what happened. would he ever figure out that i'm dead? i thought about how he would be better off not being around someone who is nothing but issues. how he would move on and find something more fulfilling.

then, i got 2 texts at the same time. one was from my sister telling me she loves me and to be safe walking at night, the other was from my boyfriend saying something goofy like always. those texts made me think about all of the good things i have, everything i take for granted. all of the people who would be hurt if i continued. those texts made me laugh, even with tears streaming down my face. then i thought about who would find my body, and how scarring that would be for them. i thought about my family, wondering where the hell i am at 3 in the morning after being gone for hours. them calling the police, crying, and thinking the worst. then i thought about how weak i am. how i keep tearing myself down, reopening healed wounds. how selfish i would be, taking the easy way out and leaving my problems to fall on my loved ones. those damned texts saved my life.

i was weak, and that's the truth. in that moment of pure selfishness, i almost did the thing i told myself i would never do. so i cut, but not deep. just to remind myself how alive i am, how things may hurt, it may feel like i'm dying, but they can heal. they may not heal perfectly, but a scar is better than an infected wound. i shall carry these scars until i am old, because i will get old. i'll live, just to spite the weakness in me. i'll say ""fuck you"" to the darkness and the coldness and that urge to give up. no more. i'm done, but not done living. i'm done with this cold, dark, deep ocean. it's my time to swim to the surface and stay afloat no matter how tired my legs may get. i'm ready to stay alive.",11
"please be wary of people asking for donations. we have a scammer that makes their rounds every so often and she's duped a few of you.. a day or two ago a post popped up by a girl claiming she was incredibly ill, bedridden, and that her boyfriend had tampered with her birth control. she claimed she needed an abortion. 

you wonderful, helpful people tried to direct her to abortion funds, hotlines, anything that could help. she said she wasn't eligible for any of it... so people started offering money and asked her to set up a gofundme.

while this is all very sweet, if any of you gave her money, you got scammed hard. there is at least one (maybe more) user that goes around posting variations of this story to /r/twoxchromosomes, /r/childfree, /r/assistance and offmychest to get money out of nice people. the mods of these 4 subreddits exchange info and warn each other when she's active so we can be on the lookout. she had posted a different sob story to /r/twoxchromosomes two weeks before her offmychest post and i just happened to catch it. 

so i'm asking you all to please report any kind of soliciting for donations directly to the mod team for review. there have been cases where i'm able to verify that the person is telling the truth and is not requesting cash, we'll allow their requests.

"i killed a chicken and felt it's final breath leave its body.. i live on a farm but i've always been a city kid. i've also always eaten meat.
 
a couple days ago the owner tells me that two roosters have raped one of the hens so badly and repeatedly that it couldn't get up and may not make it. he tells me they need to die.

for some reason i volunteered to kill them, remove feathers, and butcher them for food. two days ago i put one in a traffic cone upside down, sharpened a knife, and cut its throat. i was very quick and the rooster didn't even flinch. i felt the warmth of the blood run over my hand. it didn't kick, squirm, or squawk. i held it until i literally felt and heard the last breath leave its little body.

i (weird i know) thanked the rooster for its sacrifice and removed the head, feathers, and guts. it was still warm. the process smelled horrific. it was nauseating. it was hard. it was sobering to the fragility of life. 

i both do and don't regret doing it. taking somethings life was taxing mentally and emotionally. however i have a much larger appreciation for my food now and what it cost to get it on my plate.

i know it's probably not that big a deal because things die every day, but i guess for me it was much harder than i thought. thanks for reading.

"i heard my boyfriend talking about me to his friend. i was at my boyfriends house earlier and he was in the kitchen with his friend who is also his roommate. i was in his room waiting for him to finish making popcorn so we could watch our movie. his room is pretty close to the kitchen and with the door shut i could hear their entire conversation. 

his friend was talking about how much it sucks being single and that he wish he had a girl. my boyfriend then proceeded to say that he isn't planning on being single ever again in his life and that he has every intention to marry me!

he came back into the room after a bit and i had a gigantic smile on my face. he asked me why i was so happy and i told him that i could hear the entire conversation. he didn't think i could hear him, but i did. he said that everything he said was true. 

it just makes me so happy because he genuinely thought i couldn't hear him and when guys say that type of stuff to their friends that's when you know it's serious. i love this man so much and knowing that he has the intention to marry me makes me so happy and excited for our future together. i love him with all of my heart and if he were to propose tomorrow i would definitely say yes <3

edit: my boyfriend is going to set a date up for his friend with a female coworker as long as she's okay with it! i just left that part out because i was too excited about the whole marriage thing. so he's not a narcissist!!

edit #2: wow! thank you for all of the positive comments! i would like to point out that my boyfriend didn't say any of that because he thought he would ""get some"" or that he thought i was listening. he's a very genuine person and really didn't think i could hear him. i've been in the room before while he's talking to people in the kitchen and i haven't heard him before. it depends on where you're standing in the kitchen and if the tv is on or not. yesterday everything worked out perfectly for me to hear his conversation. 

i would also like to tell you all that his friend has a date on friday! (that's the only time in their work schedules when the date would work. we're hoping the best for him because he's a really cool dude).

i would call ""toby"" and play with you and say ""good boy! what a good boy you are! you're such a good boy!""

i would call ""moby"" and play with you and say ""i love you moby. i love you so much. you're so lovely.""

turns out those were your formative years, and now you don't respond to toby and moby. you've heard me say something else more often than your name so you got used to hearing the sound of ""good boy"" and ""i love you.""

toby, your life is a lie. your name is toby, not ""good boy"". 
moby, your life is a lie. your your name is moby, not ""i love you.""

ps. you're both good boys, and i love you both.

"what it's like to lose your child unexpectedly.... my 18-year-old daughter died in a car accident on her way to school a few weeks ago.  i'm going to try to convey what it's like.  

police officer shows up at the door:  this will haunt me for the rest of my life.  my fiancee and i were sleeping, as we work 3rd shift.  the beating on the door was loud... i'm not sure how long he was there before it woke me up.  it did not wake my fiance up.  i looked out the window and saw an unmarked suv but i could tell it was the police.  i answered the door and he said my name.  i answered ""yes"".  he said my daughter's name and i said ""yes"".  he said that she was in an accident (i knew what was coming next) and that she had expired.  i went to my knees and made noises i've never heard myself make before.  he got me inside to the couch and asked if anyone else was there.  i told him my fiance's name as i was crying uncontrollably.  he yelled her name a number of times and she came out.  he started talking to her and she started yelling ""oh my god"" and came to hold me.  she and my daughter were very close. 

telling family:  about a half hour later i started making phone calls.  this part is crucial.  if this happens to you, make these calls as soon as possible or have someone go tell them quickly.  word spreads like wildfire... especially with social media.  you do not want loved ones finding out this way.  someone posted about this on my wall only a few hours after this happened.  i made the calls and cried as i listened to them wail.  it is aweful.  

seeing her after the accident:  at first i did not want to see her.  i kept saying ""that's not her.""  later in the day i changed my mind.  this was extremely surreal and heartbreaking.  she was transported to the funeral home the same day.  we all stood there in the hallway until a man asked if we were ready.  he opened a door to a room, i walked in and saw her all by herself at the far end of the room in a casket.  this was my daughter in front of me... my beautiful girl that was full of life that very morning.  i kissed her forehead repeatedly and told her how much i love her. 

people and planning:  besides the grief, i never realized how overwhelming something like this was.  while i was still in shock, people were reaching out from everywhere... many of which i hadn't heard from in years.  i was on the phone for the majority of each day for over a week straight... not to mention all the people visiting.  all of these people were sincerely caring and i appreciate them all, but i can't exactly describe what it does to your emotional state other than saying it's overwhelming and draining.  the planning is another thing that i did not expect and it begins almost immediately.  there are countless things that needed to be taken care of and i had to do all of these things while grieving.  i'm still not done with everything, actually. 

her funeral: it was six days after her death and i thought i had no tears left.  i was very wrong.  i still could not completely wrap my mind around the fact that i was at my own daughter's funeral.  i've known other people who have lost children... but this had actually happened to mine.

grieving:  the first two days after her accident were filled with non-stop crying and disbelief.  i'm a grown man who rarely cries.  the third day was off and on crying all day and now it's about 2 to 3 times a day.  for the first week it hit me especially hard in the mornings when i woke up.  i'm now in a state of constant sadness and still some disbelief that she is not coming home... but not as much crying.  the most accurate and heartbreaking word i can use to describe this whole thing is ""permanent"".  it's the most permanent thing i've ever experienced in my life.  no matter how much my mind tries to find a way around it at times, she's not coming back.

guilt and regret:  i wish i had done things different.  i wish i had spent more time with her than what i did.  i wish i had protected her more than what i did from those who were unkind and even emotionally abusive to her.  i wish i had been awake that morning to see her off to school... maybe i could have changed something and maybe she wouldn't have wrecked.  i wish i could have been there to hold her during her last minutes of life.  i wish it would have been me instead.  i feel guilty doing things... like going out to eat (haven't felt like cooking) and taking my other two children to the movies last night.  

her accident:  i'm still obsessing over it and still finding out details from those who were there.  she knew she was dying and was asking those around her to pray with her.  she always wore her seatbelt but she didn't have it on this time.  did she drop something and take it off?  she had food in the car that she got from the nearby gas station that morning.  i checked her phone and my verizon log and she wasn't texting or talking to anyone.  why did she over-correct her steering?  these are the questions i'm trying to answer.  i know it won't change anything but for some reason i need to know.  

i'm only 2 weeks and 3 days in to this and i know i have a long way to go... but so far this is the best way i can describe what it's like to lose your child.  she was extremely smart, talented, beautiful and kind... she had an amazing life waiting on her.  i love her to no end and i miss her every minute of the day. 

i have to remain strong for those who need me... so i think telling my story and pouring my heart out here helps in a way. ",11
"first time ever telling this. left my son in car by accident 3 years ago. makes me sick many days when i think about it or see it on the news. hope this helps someone. i never thought it would be me. i always thought of the stereotype of people that leave kids in cars as low income, druggies, low iq, and people that didn't really care to have kids in the first place.  

i was 31, married with 2 kids, above average income, zero drugs, and occasional drinks at sporting events. work 40-45 hours a week, live in a nice neighborhood, etc. i love my family with all my heart and would be empty without them. my son was 6 months at the time. 

three years ago, the four of us were going out to dinner on a nice spring day. i dropped my wife and daughter off at the front door so they could get us on the wait list and i went to the park the car. i put the car in park, got out, and went straight in the restaurant. sat down and started chatting with my wife. within about 30 seconds she asked where our son was. i immediately stood up frantically with my stomach and heart feeling stuck to the floor. i went out and he was sound asleep. 

i don't know why this happened. there is no excuse. he wasn't in immediate danger because it was about 65 degrees, but had it been bad weather and just me and my son, our family could have been forever changed. 

as a new parent, i always wondered what kind of parent doesn't love their kid enough to remember to get them out. tie something around your keys and finger, or something as an extra safely. i don't know. my mind was somewhere else. we normally don't go in separate. he was sleeping. perfect storm and i failed. 

hope this helps one person out there.

edit: can't keep up with all the replies, but i want to say thank you for the people that had encouraging words. to those that judged....i was you until it happened to me. to someone else's point, we have to make it habit to check or have a security backup. 

best wishes to all",11

"i just broke an 8 year old girl's heart.. i'm a 26 year old male. 

i teach sunday school at my church and several years ago i had my first class of 5 year olds. my day job is as a construction worker so i don't get to interact with kids much, but as a kid at heart, i enjoyed being their teacher. i can match their energy and enthusiasm while keeping us on topic and interested. this particular class really meshed well since we didn't have any major disruptors in the group. 

one of the ones that really connected with me was lucy. a tiny little blonde girl who was super quiet until i started asking her about her day and her interests. she would go on and on about her brothers and friends and always had the cutest positive energy. 

even after she moved up to other classes, she would still run up to me after church every week and give me a hug and tell me all about her week. in all honesty, it was adorable! one day she even went on and on how her brothers and her were drawing blueprints for a hedgehog farm i was to build for them.... oh the minds of kids are so amusing! 

fast forward to last week when i was sitting at a church gathering eating some amazing potluck food and she runs over to sit with me. my fiancee happened to be there too so i turned to lucy and said, ""hey lucy! have you met my fiancee maggie yet?"" she looked confused, (especially cute with her face scrunched up behind her new glasses) and asked, ""what's a fiancee?"" 

i said, ""it means we are getting married soon!"" 

well. right then is when i found out lucy had a crush on me. her lips started trembling, her shoulders quaking, her eyes welling up and tears falling down.... she grabbed her food and ran to her parents table and started sobbing into her mother's arms uncontrollably. 

the mom looked at me with a sad smile and they ended up taking her home because she was so heartbroken. 

i felt awful. 

and that's how i broke an 8 year old's heart. 

tl;dr: 8 year old girl i taught had a huge crush on me i had never considered until i introduced her to my fiancee and her entire future crumbled before her eyes.",11
i am proud of my son. my middle son (11) is a complete social butterfly and has a lot of friends in school. this has caused a few problems as he sees school as a place to socialise rather then learn. a few days ago he had a female friend confide in him that her dad hits her a lot. he went and spoke to his head teacher about this. the school rang the right people   and he was arrested.  today he came home and told me he got a big hug of his friend as she has been told that this man is not allowed near her or her family. i am proud that he knew this was wrong and had to protect his friend by speaking to an adult he felt at that time could help. i really hope she and her family can have a lovely future without that piece of shit in it. ,11
"to the man who received a lap dance from me (24f). as a dancer, it is my job to entertain and distract people from their normal life. i am viewed as a beautiful fantasy and sometimes therapist (aka stripper therapy). many people view the club as a place for lonely men to go. that is true to some extent, but we are also the place for many broken men. i don't encounter too many that are open about it, but last saturday was the most heartbreaking encounter i have ever had.

my night was almost over, it was about 12:30am and i had been called to the stage for my last stage set of the night. i began my usual routine of rolling around on the floor and lifting myself on the pole. eventually, i made it around to all of the guests sitting at the stage. it was my 3rd and last song and a red bearded man (33m) walked up to the back of my stage and looked me in my eyes as he held up a dollar. 

i am pretty good with reading people. i'm what some might consider an empath. as he looked at me, i could tell his eyes were filled with sadness. this is pretty normal at the club because we have many men who are going through divorces. however, this wasn't disappointed and confused sadness. this was lost and empty sadness. 

i stepped off the stage, put my dress back on and walked to him. i sat in his lap and asked him his name and how he was doing and he said he wasn't okay and that he was getting by. i told him i was sorry he was feeling that way and used my typical dancer line of let me make your night better and lets have fun. he said i could try. something didn't sit well with me about his tone so i asked him why he was there. he was wearing a wedding ring so i assumed was going through a divorce. i asked, did you get fired from a job? he said no. i asked are you going through a divorce? he said no. i asked then why do you seem so sad? he said, last year, i lost my bff, my dog, and my dad. and this january, i lost my wife to a brain aneurysm. one minute she was fine, the next minute she was dead. he also said he hadn't been able to talk about it until now.

i had no words for a moment. grief is not something i am prepared to deal with, for i have never lost someone that close to me. i told him that he was doing well because he had finally had the courage to talk to a stranger about the situation and that sometimes strangers are best because you will never see them again. we exchanged a few minor words and then he asked me if i would distract him so we went to the back for a dance.

i don't know how other strip clubs work, but we have two options. the first is single song dances and the second is timed. they can touch within reason and there are cameras everywhere. he chose the 15 minute option so i walk him back to the room with a big comfy couch. he sits down and lets out a huge sigh. i take off my dress and sit in his lap.

i honestly thought he was going to cry in my arms. he described how he hadn't done anything for himself since her death except got to work, come home, and sleep. the worst part was the ounce of hope that she would walk through the door at any moment like nothing ever happened. the hope that she was okay and living her best life. he admitted to needing to see a therapist and i told him that if he can open up to me, someone he hasn't met, he could open up to a counselor, someone professional who knew how to help him through his grief. 

i could have cried there in his arms for him. as someone who has never dealt with grief, i do not want to imagine the pain lack of closure brings. not being able to prepare for death as if she had been sick. just accepting those deaths happened and being expected to live my life normally. 

for about 10 minutes he held me tight in a hug. there wasn't much to be said but i did get a couple of laughs and a smile out out of him. he said it was the first time he had laughed in awhile and thanked me for allowing him to open up. we discussed upcoming concerts and he invited me along as a friend. i told him if he sought professional help, to come back and i would consider giving him my number. 

sometimes my job requires me to make money off of others pain, because i am essentially a distraction. i feel like an asshole for it. but at the same time, he needed someone to listen to him and i gave him the rest of my night. part of me hopes he'll come back and update me on going to therapy. i also hope he finds love again.  


edit: i want to thank everyone for the positive feedback on my story. this is my first story i've shared and i wasn't expecting this much love and support. 

i would like to say that i would never consider myself an amazing person for giving him my time. i care more than anyone will know because something simple as listening can have a huge impact on someone's life. people in pain need people who care because it can be hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel and positive people act as the light, guiding them through a time that seems like it might not end.

from a dancer's point of view, this kind of experience can be especially taxing on our psyche, especially because we are not prepared to deal with this kind of situation. some men want our time for free and this is where most of us draw the line. we are paid for our time to entertain and if he pays because he needs an ear or hug, i will always listen and never judge.

to the people who reacted negatively about him going to a club to express himself, everyone seeks help at their own pace in their own way. one can't be held by their professional therapist and nothing will replace the importance of physical touch. ",11

"i met my boyfriend's girlfriend last night. so ive been seeing a guy for about 6 months now and i thought we were getting pretty serious, he and i were supposed to fly out in july to see my family in california for my grandmother's birthday. but i guess i was wrong. 
so yesterday, my best friend and i get off of work, and my boyfriend (let's call him daniel) came to pick us up. my best friend came with me to the bar we frequent after especially crazy shifts. we sat in a booth and daniel eventually left his friends and came to sit with us. we were sitting, talking and drinking when two girls probably around my age walked up to the booth. we all stared for a second, it was silent, and then one of the girls reaches her hand out to shake mine and says, ""hi i'm daniel's girlfriend, it's nice to meet you. we're leaving now"". 
he finished his beer, stood up and walked away with them. he didnt look at me, he didnt say anything. he just left me there, frozen and shattered.  
at one point probably 20 minutes later, i got up and went back over to the restaurant where i work to see if my boss had a tip out for me yet. during this time, i learned when i got back to the bar, one of the girls came back to question my friend and was looking for me. she asked my name, where i worked, where i lived, how long daniel and i had been seeing each other. it was just a terrible fucked up situation so my friend came and got me from work and we booked it out of there. 
this has definitely been one of the more shocking events in my life, but it still hasn't totally hit me yet. as of right now i'm still okay. i still haven't heard from him or seen him. 
i'm so angry. i have so many questions. i hate that i let myself be fooled. i hate him for making me think he was the only good man i've ever had.

"i have something to share, it would mean alot if you read it. last year, something bad and unjust happened to me, it triggered my depression and suicidal thoughts and somehow my parents came to know about it. i really didn't want it to happen because i've always been emotionally numb to my parents and wanted to keep it that way but after my father found out that i was depressed and had suicidal thoughts, he told me his story.

&#x200b;

when i was one year old, my father got into a fight with a subordinate. he had been a supervisor for many years and had a subordinate (let's call him jim) who kept pushing for a promotion but my father couldn't recommend him because he had very poor work ethic. jim got really aggravated and started taunting my father on a daily basis, taunting and cursing him every single day until my dad scolded him back.

&#x200b;

jim then picked a fight with my dad and got my dad fought back and got badly injured. my dad lost his job that day and found out that jim did it on purpose because jim had secured a job in another country and wanted them both to get fired - since jim basically wanted to leave the company. it was the lowest point in my dad's life not only because of how unfair it was, he had to get stitches, he lost his job, and he had to go back home to his wife and one year old son to tell them the bad news.

&#x200b;

my dad's friend (let's call him timothy), offered my dad a partnership to start up a new company and fast forward a few decades, the business became really successful.

&#x200b;

my dad told me, you can't win all the time and one day you will lose, its about what you learn and how you pick yourself up. he said tragedies are sometimes a blessing in disguise and we all become a bit wiser after each trial. hate is like a gift, if you refuse it, the other person has to take it back. he said he wanted to find jim and thank him for causing him to lose his job because of how much more he accomplished compared to if he had stayed in that job as a supervisor.

i'm typing this story here for a few reasons:

1. i want to record his story so that i have something to look at when i'm down.
2. maybe it will help someone out there.
3. i needed a place to process my thoughts.

"i got a hit. i collected a sample that got a child removed from the care of her rapist.. thank you so much for all the kind, encouraging replies, i got teary again reading from the survivors, the other professionals, and those seeking to support people they know and love.

thank you to the people who commented with understanding of the uncertainty of unfolding case, and the deep, complex trauma of the little girl.

the case is not closed, although i said the the evidence could not be ""explained away,"" this was a gross simplification of the role that forensic evidence plays in criminal justice, and referred only to the simplest kinds of cross contamination. if this case ever goes to trial (as opposed to a plea, or a simple termination of parental rights,) there is the possibility that a jury will decide that there is an innocent explanation. and in the absence of a clear disclosure, they may be right to do so.

so right now i am just hoping the little girl is safe. i hope she is with safe, good family members, or in a stable, loving foster home, or even in a facility with caring, professional, well trained staff who can help her feel a little bit more normal and relaxed.

i hope so much that she never needs to be removed from a home again.

"giving birth to my daughter changed the way i love my foster children.. my daughter was born 2 months ago. throughout my entire pregnancy many people told me that the way i felt about my foster children would change when my birth child was born.  

""it's different with your *own* kid."" 

""your world will change when you hold your baby for the first time."" 

""you don't know love, until you've had a child."" 

although i wasn't fostering while i was pregnant, i still had a close relationship with my foster children and their birth families. i'd fostered 10 children total. two sibling groups of 3. one sibling group of 4. all ended up back with their birth families at the end of their stays with me. but i've told my foster children a thousand times they will always be my ""family by heart"". i'm always there for them. i'll always love them. and that's the arguement i made to the many people who told me that things would change when my birth child arrived. people kept telling me i wouldn't love my foster children as much once she was here. ""things would just be different."" and i continually argued that that was not the case.

then, on february 10th 2018, my little girl arrived. and as i transitioned into the role of ""birth parent"", i realized they were right... sort of. the people who told me that i'd love my foster kids differently after the arrival of my daughter, were right. things were different. *everything* was different. from the moment my daughter was born she had someone there to love her. she was coddled, cuddled, loved, adored, and cherished. her diaper is always changed right away. when she's hungry, she's fed immediately. if she's cold, there's a body ready to warm her up. and if she's lonely, there's a mother just a few steps away who is ready to hold her- for hours upon relentless hours. my daughter is loved- not just in my heart, but through my actions. 

and the more i cared for my daughter, the more my heart ached for my foster children. i would sit at night, holding my newborn, and i would cry over the fact that my foster kids were not always loved in the way my birth daughter was (and always will be). i know that their cries were not always answered. they were not always fed. their clothes were not always clean and they were not always shown unconditional love through the actions of the adults around them. and i hurt so terribly for them. i wish with everything that i could go back in time and find a way to get to them and love them- the same way i love my birth daughter. i wish that they never would have had to have been through a day where they were not cared for.  

i didn't think it was possible, but giving birth to my daughter has made me love my foster children even more. it's made my heart break for them further. it's made me wish that i could do something -anything- to ensure they had as privilaged of a life as my birth daughter will have. if someone told me that if i cut off my own leg, each of my foster kids would instanteously be offered a good life- i'd grab a knife without hesitation. but life isn't fair, and their lives (in brutal honesty) are not fair- and will not be fair. and that's what hurts most of all. i can't give them the life i can give my daughter. i have no legal or biological right to do so. but i have the emotional right to care about them, and i sure as hell will- for the rest of their lives.

 i want to be a snob, and go up to the people who told me ""things would change"" and tell them that i love my foster children even more now that my birth daughter has entered this world. but i don't think they'd understand. there are so many people out there who simply believe that the only way to have a true connection with a child is to share their genetics. and perhaps, for them, that's true. but for me- it isn't. not one bit. 

 ""it's different with your *own* kid."" - foster children are my *own* children. perhaps not in a traditional sense, but in my heart they were my *own* kids from the day they arrived on my doorstep- with their tattered clothes shoved into garbage bags. the memories i have with them are ones that bless my heart each and every day. they always cross my mind. and i hope they never stop crossing my mind- as they deserve to be there.

""your world will change when you hold your baby for the first time."" - it did, in a lot of ways. i had never thought about the privilage of children who came from good homes before having my daughter. i'd always fostered and just kind of accepted the fact that sometimes life is shitty- and good kids get really shitty upbringings. it wasn't until my daughter was born that i began to contemplate the fact that life doesn't *have* to be shitty. and it's not okay that any child has to start out life in a shitty situation. (i really don't like cursing, but for the sake of getting my point across i think it's fair. ""shit"" is really the only accurate way to describe this all). having my daughter has made me even more empathetic. my world did change- in a way that has only reassured me that fostering is my calling. and, now, fostering to adopt is- because if i can give children a better life, i will. 

""you don't know love, until you've had a child."" - i knew love the second i fostered my first sibling group. they were my ""first child(ren)"". and i knew love again and again- with my second sibling group, my third sibling group, and the birth of my daughter. but the love each of those kids has recieved from me is no more special or deep than the love any of the other's are given. they are all loved equally. each kid is loved differently- a unique love tailored to their needs and the absolutely wonderful relationship i hold with them. and although i love each child in a different way, they are all loved with the same hopeless tenacity. 

i don't know how to end this rant, other than simply saying that if you've ever wondered about fostering- do it. i could tell you 1,000 stories of ways my foster children impacted my life dramatically. they taught me so many lessons and gave me so many amazing memories. i've never laughed harder than i did with them. i've also never cried harder- and i've never been taught so much patience. it's hard, but so is catering to my birth child. the stereotypes you've heard about foster kids aren't true. each of my children were brilliant- smart, funny, kind, helpful individuals. sure- they had some issues from time to time (show me a single kid who doesn't throw tantrums, struggle with something in school, or have some wild emotions sometimes). but they were- they are- amazing. fostering will change your life, people. and we need more good foster parents out there. i did it single. i did it on a $30k a year salary. you don't need to be straight, married, a homeowner, or rich to foster. i'm not religious. i had no ""spiritual calling"" to foster. i just love kids- so freaking much. and if you do, please please please consider it.  and if you have no yearning to bring a non-biological child into your home and heart, don't underestimate someone else's ability to love a child they didn't give birth to. i have had a birth child, and i have had foster children. and i know, for a fact, they can both be loved whole-heartedly.",11
"my boyfriend ""walks"" me home every night.. i work late quite late into the night. sometimes i don't get off till 2 or 3 in the morning. i live about a 5-6 minute walk from work, so i opt to just walk home each night.

"i used to purposely wake up my daughter when she was a baby because i felt lonely.. i stopped doing this when she was about a year old and got a few cats, which helped. 

my husband died during the pregnancy and i had no immediate family members or friends that i could talk to and it was such a low point in my life that she was the only source of social interaction outside of shopping going to the doctors, i worked from home so i had no coworkers to talk to.

i'd go up to her crib and cough, laugh, or sneeze loud enough to wake her. sometimes i'd even turn the tv  volume up if my other tactics didn't work. i was emotionally dependent on her, she was my everything and only will to live.

luckily i'm not like this anymore but i just felt like i needed to say this out loud somewhere.

~

i'm getting married and my wedding ring just came in and i love it so much. ever since i got engaged i've been thinking about what kind of wedding band i'd need to go with it and i settled on a chevron style ring. my engagement ring is teardrop shaped so a chevron fits it perfectly but i love the chevron ring for another reason. 

it reminds me of sailor moon. 

a chevron ring is the same shape as the tiaras in sailor moon and i grew up adoring that show. i had a friend who also loved sailor moon, she and i would watch and talk about it and she was the only other person i knew in my small town that liked the show as much as i did. one of the last things this friend and i did was watch a live adaptation of the show just to laugh and have fun.

she then died from a genetic disorder before her 23rd birthday. she's the only person who would truely understand my love of my chevron ring, i could tell my fiance but he doesn't know or understand sailor moon at all and his support wouldn't be the same. 

i miss her and all i want is to laugh with her one last time about my ring before i get married",11

"caught partner lying. he apparently thinks the grass is greener elsewhere. i'm done.. spent 2 years in an abusive relationship. his cheating started the same way - ""oh i was just curious, just checking in"", small lies about communicating with women, denying photographic evidence. my ex just got more bold as the betrayal escalated and continued. 

just caught my current boyfriend lying, to my face, about the same actions. i'm angry and hurt. he knows all about my prior experience and has always been the exact opposite of my ex. well, so i thought. 

unfortunately for my current boyfriend, i decided the day i left my ex that i would never tolerate this crap again. he knew this too. 

i've carried his ass financially since i moved in. i'm tired of acting like a mother - cooking, cleaning and waiting for him to get his act together. he apparently wanted to have his cake and eat it too. i have no time for this bs.

"to the stranger at the coffee shop this morning: thank you.. i was sitting in a coffee shop this morning before work looking rather mangey - no makeup, 4-day old hair in a braid, not my cutest clothes, red, puffy eyes from crying, etc. i've been going through a rough patch of anxiety and depression and have been pretty fed up with social media and technology in general as of late, so i didn't have my phone, a computer, or anything with me. i just wanted to sit, have a cup of coffee, and watch the world go by out the window for a while.

after about 10 minutes, a guy walked past my table and complimented my hair. a little while after that, the same guy came back and asked if he could speak with me for a few minutes. he told me he was intrigued that i was the only one in the place not glued to any sort of technology, he thought i was ""very pretty,"" and that he couldn't help but notice i looked sad and/or i had a lot on my mind. he said he didn't want to pry, but he hoped things started looking up for me soon, wished me well, and left. i don't necessarily believe in angels, but it's almost as if this person was some sign from the universe to keep my chin up.

hopefully by sharing this interaction, it can be a reminder to someone that even at your lowest and darkest, there's at least one person out there who sees beauty and light in you, even if you can't see it yourself.

"a girl i barely knew literally saved my life.... so in 2016 i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome. basically what it means is that my blood has too much clotting factor, and because it took so long for the doctors to diagnose it, there is damage to my arteries and also my kidneys and liver (it was diagnosed because i ended up with blood clots in my right kidney and then weeks later in my liver).

one night not long after i was diagnosed, i had bought a massive amount of painkillers and benzodiazepines from a guy i knew, and i had booked a room at a hotel, and i was planning on committing suicide. at the time i was homeless, i had been dumped recently, and i felt so alone, and i didn't want to fight this disorder that was destroying my body.

at around 9pm that night a girl i had met maybe 4 times sent me a message asking if i wanted to come hang out. so i figured why not.

when i got there, we got talking and i told her about my diagnosis, and about being homeless, and how i was struggling. i didn't tell her that i was suicidal, just that things were hard. she immediately offered me her spare room to stay in, and offered to help me with my medical appointments.

3 years later, and i have met the man of my dreams, and gotten married, and my health is improving. i finally told that girl (who is now one of my best friends) that she stopped me from killing myself that night, and she broke down. she told me that she didn't know why she invited me over that night, but she is glad she did.

anyway i just wanted to get that off my chest.

***edit*** i want to thank everyone for taking the time to read this, and especially for all of the supportive comments.

i was going through the worst period in my life when this happened, and if i had killed myself i would have never had the chance to experience all of the amazing things that have happened since.",11
"i'm glad my grandpa left my mother only $1 in his will and gave the rest to his grandchildren.. back in 2004, he told me he was going to do it. he said he changed his will and was going to leave my grandma his ex wife $2 and his kids my uncle & mother $1 each while he left the rest to me and my sisters. 12 year old me thought ""yeah right, okay i'll believe it when i see it"". 

well what do ya know, he passed away in 2014 and during the reading of his will, jaws were dropping, tears were flowing, shock was setting in. my mother called me because i was living out of state at the time and broke the news. at first, i couldn't believe it but i remember what he told me ten years before that. you son of a gun. i felt bad for my uncle but my mother, people a kick out of that every time i tell the story, here's why. 

here's a little back story about my mother. she's crazy, refuses to get help and made our entire family's life a living hell my entire childhood. we were subject to physical and emotional abuse, alcoholism, homelessness, going evenings without meals, living in poverty, domestic violence, leaving me and my sisters home alone for hours while she worked. she never got caught for anything she did to us. i moved out as soon as i graduated and moved out of state. the tipping point for her finally came when she was arrested for third degree child abuse, lost custody of her kids, lost her job at a school, got a felony. 

i have no remorse for this woman. i do not talk to her anymore because it's a toxic relationship and i will not subject myself, my husband or my children to that. i'm glad she only got $1. that's all she deserves. thank you grandpa for helping us get out of debt and a new vehicle. i love you and miss you always.

"i lost 30 pounds, but i know all you see is a fat girl.. you approach me with advice trying to get me to sign up for your program. you asked why im at the gym and what my goals are. when i told you it was so i can physically feel better you laughed and said there must be more. then you asked me to imagine myself infront of the mirror weighing 40 pounds less. how would i feel then. when you asked what i ate, i answered truthfully, but you decided to add to stay away from junk food and cook home meals. i guess you missed the part where i said i bake chicken and veggies on a daily bases. what you dont know is, i lost 30 pounds and it was hard. i feel hungry all the time, i want to eat all my favourite foods so bad but i know at the moment i can't. i am tired and drained after work, but i still make myself cook, clean, work out and do my home work. i know i'm still fat and i need to lose more weight but i feel great. i dont feel sleepy at work, i stay awake after lunch time and best of all, i can run and dance with my pre-school class. there is so much more to weight loss than appearance but you would never know that because you have never been an obese person. at the end of the day, i'll keep doing what i'm doing. this wont stop me from going to the gym, but i have recently added a new goal. i can't wait to reach a weight where people like you can stop judging my everyday choices based on my looks. i'm working on myself, i'm just not there yet.

"dying from cancer, manage to accomplish things i can say i'm proud of, but wasn't able to find someone who loves me.. i have lung cancer and stage 4 nhl. non-smoker by the way, just lost the lottery, that's all. considering the damage found from early on during the initial diagnosis, i am not expected to live for too long. i don't want to get into details in case some friends recognize this.

i'm roughly 27 years old. i've been trying out new things, i have had so much fun with new hobbies, instruments i've learned over the last year, and have developed a routine for the gym since high school. i didn't manage to go into what i wanted, entering college, but i'm happy with the jobs i managed to pick up from connections. i'm very happy with what i've done so far.

but the one thing i've tried to do, and have failed at, is to find a girl who likes me. i don't bring up what i have and my outlook, but as of dozens of approaches and some new friendships kindled, there has been no one attracted to me. apart from my physique, i'm not physically attractive up in the face, to say the least. been trying different things since high school, nothing has changed as of yet.

i don't want a hookup, not that i have one so far, or a pity fuck since i don't want to bring up my cancer as i don't want it to be the reason or my identity, but honestly this is the one thing that keeps me up at night. i'm still waiting for someone and i likely won't find this person.

my lungs are starting to deteriorate, i've started exhibiting symptoms of where things will start to go downhill from here on out. i've seen the specialists and it's not looking so good. 2019 might be my last year.

i don't know why i'm writing this. i have lots of friends who love me, parents that i'm blessed to have in my life, and have done things i'm proud of. but something as selfish as wanting someone to love me and be attracted to me, i can't achieve that.

i just needed to get this out there. sorry, it's probably a bunch of nonsense, i'm not that eloquent in getting my words out.

i know i'm going to expect some pity responses and the same old phrases, and i'd rather not, but fuck it really hurts today.

edit: thank you for words, i couldn't get through reading most of them since i didn't expect to get this kind of reaction, and also went to bed. i'll try to respond to those who reached out if i can, but there's a lot so my apologies if i don't get back to you! i'm speechless right now!

"i'm not poor because of iced coffee.. oh my sweet lord am i sick of this ""advice"". everywhere i go – internet, real life, everywhere – the same trite nonsense. i'm talking, of course, about the following:

""if you want to save money, you should stop buying that coffee everyday!""

""if you make your own coffee at home, you can save $1.9b per annum.""

""dae stop buying the coffee?""

my god, even the financial aid director of my graduate school gave us this advice. newsflash, my friend, i'm not poor because i buy an iced coffee everyday. i'm poor because of the opaque and inflated tuition that american universities charge in order for people to accomplish their lifelong dreams.

but that's very much beside the point. why? *because life is not just about accumulating money.*

""do you realize how much you spend per year on coffee?""

yes. i spent $2.12 most weekdays.

""but do you know how much that adds up to?""

yeah. it's like $12 per week, $48 per month, $576 per year.

""do you realize that you are a bad person for having done this?""

no. because it brings me joy. yes, i know exactly how much money it costs. i pay my rent and bills on time. i also buy this, because it makes me happy and gives me something little to look forward to everyday. when i die i won't be celebrating the infinitesimal difference in my bank account that i could have achieved by nobly giving up one of my daily pleasures. i *will* celebrate the joy that comes with the human experience.

alright, i'm off to buy an iced coffee.

"""old"" disgraced ballerina here.... when i was 4 years old, i was immediately enrolled at a ballet academy. due to my body not being a proper ballet body, i was put on a strict diet (at 5, yes 5 years old). no junk food, no carbs, lots of gym. this cycle haunted me well into adulthood. when i got older, girls would bring in cigarettes and use them behind the building, i couldn't smoke, i play the trumpet! nevertheless i found myself inhaling second hand smoke, feeling like a million bucks when i danced, even though nothing really changed. my performances were outstanding, but this horrible diet left me clawing for some chocolate and a seinfeld marathon, even though i only ever had chocolate once. soon these two girls came. they were good and the instructor was so nice to them. i'm not saying anything against being a pet of the instructor and i guess we all have our favourites, but i remember standing on point shoes for two hours waiting to do something while these girls were drowning in attention. i was so furious that i got other girls standing around to help me confront the instructor. after 22 years of this nightmare, the body shaming, the abuse, the climax came up during the nutcracker, my last performance. i was originally a principal role but i was put in the chorus line in favour of the two girls. sure, i can accept that they could perform the role better, but a week before we open? i was doing my best when my overworked body caught up with me. i collapsed onstage. i was put in care and was taught that eating well was more important than looking good. it's been a year since i have last touched my ballet shoes and i've tried different things. i now carry the title of a disgraced ballerina. i went to my last day and my instructor shamed me, my short hair, highlights glistening in the sun, my new diet, ruining the work she put in, my face pale without makeup, the new me. big shoutout to her: i hope no-one else suffers in your grotesque hands. fuck you for making me read thinspo blogs and share what i've learnt, fuck you for making me feel like shit when i saw naturally thin people and crying that i'll never be attractive. kiss my full round ass. i am a disgraced ballerina and i could not be happier.

 the hotel we got married at wasn't the the cheapest sure but they had an alternative hotel not far from the one we got married at for much less. the worst part had to be that we payed to cater a 100 people at the wedding party. not one person showed up who had been invited to the wedding party. the food went to waste the band we hired only did 2 songs. the wedding cake was made to serve a 100 people. 

if my wife hadn't just got married she would of been crying her eyes out it was embarrassing. 

but we made the best of it we took some food, cake and drinks to the bridal parlor and since we knew the band personally we all sat in there and had a little jam session. it was good but it's hard not to think about the amount of people who didn't turn up, people who left so early, how much it all cost us and how embarrassing it was seeing 6 empty tables in the huge hall decorated amazingly by my wife and the staff at the venue.",11

i have two brothers and a sister (i'm a guy), and i'm also the youngest. i was the ""accident."" mom wanted a girl, and she finally got my sister at the third try, but i just happened and i was reminded of this every single day of my life. i was told, constantly, that i would never amount to anything. 

my oldest brother grew up to be a mechanic with a wife he cheats on regularly, my second brother committed suicide ten years ago, and my sister is addicted to pain pills and has three kids of her own and lives with my parents. 

but me? i fucking graduated high school, got a scholarship to stanford (stanford!), and i got the *fuck* away from there. i got out of tn and i won. i fucking won. 

i'm currently back home in tn attending the funeral of my aunt that passed away, and my family began arguing over money. everything was left to my father (it was his sister), but there's a huge argument going on over it. everyone treats me with hostility, and i was never welcomed in this family. but you know what? i won. i don't fucking care how much i'm disliked simply for existing. 

i made it. i succeeded in life. i was able to conquer all of the shit that was thrown at me. 

while my parents and siblings were arguing over the money today, i watched them from the background. quietly, i slipped out of the front door without even saying a word. i'm never coming back here. there's nothing to come back to. besides, i have my own life. 

and you may think this is arrogant or awful of me to say, but i was shit on -- constantly -- for 18 years of my life. growing up unwanted is an awful thing to bear witness to. but i did it. *i fucking did it.*

i have no family, but i have ""family"" back in california who have loved me more than my parents ever have. so, i'm not sad or upset. i'm fucking happy to be rid of this burden. 

i won. i wasn't another ""victim"" of small town life. i beat the odds, distanced myself, and i fucking defeated my own demons. 

i'm fucking proud of myself, and no one can take that away from me. 

**edit:** i am... beyond surprised that this post exploded. i made this while sitting at the airport and waiting for my delayed flight. i just thought it would be lost, but i just sat and read so many messages of support, encouragement and amazing perseverance from you guys. you are all wonderful, amazing human beings. i want to thank you for sharing your own stories and making yourselves vulnerable to me. i will do everything i can to reply to each and every single one of them. but there are a few things i think i made unclear from my post:

* i am 24. i graduated from stanford in 2012 with my bachelor of science in cee (civil and environmental engineering). side note: i'm currently working as a ta at stanford and going to grad school for construction engineering and management.
* the reason why i made this post was because, ever since i graduated high school and moved away from tn, my parents never made an effort to contact me, nor did my siblings -- except my oldest brother, who told me that my aunt had died. the summer after i finished my undergraduate degree, i decided to visit my family (i had not seen them since i left home at 18 and they did not come to my graduation, nor did they even send a card/phone call). when i got there, no one even knew who i was. seriously. i showed up with my luggage and my mom said, and i quote, ""who the fuck are you?"" when i told her, she asked where i was staying -- i wasn't even welcome in the home. after staying there for a few weeks, my parents decided to ask me for $2000, saying that they needed it for bills/stop their home from being foreclosed on. i gave them the money. my mom ended up giving half of it to my sister for a new car and my dad used it to buy wheels for his truck. his fucking truck. that's really what made me understand that i was nothing more than a stranger to them and they were strangers to me. so, essentially, two years ago is when i ""separated"" myself from them. no one even asked about college, my life or even how i was doing. *i was just there.* so after about a month of being back in tn, i decided to move back to ca -- permanently -- and live with my boyfriend. and that's what i did. i left then, but i was angry and upset and hurt. i was enraged, but i thought in the back of my mind, ""maybe they'll come around one day?"" before i left, my oldest brother shook my hand and said that he wishes things would have been different for me. i'm not sure what he meant by that, but that was the most intimate we had ever been. 

* i came back for my aunt's funeral in hopes of reconciling with my family. and, as i told you all in my post, it didn't happen that way. when i got into town, i was burning up with rage and anger and resentment. i was so ready to lay into my family and tell them off. but after i sat through the funeral and after my pilled-up sister pissed in the flower pot at the funeral home (i'm not even kidding) and after my father forgot who i was (again), i just realized i have to let it all go. i had to let them all go. so when i walked out through the front door, that was the last time i was ever coming back. no more. i renounced my relationship with them. and all that anger and bitterness and resentment i was feeling just melted away, and i felt the weight lift off my shoulders. even my older brother who, in the past, had shown me some humanity, seemed distant. he didn't even look at me while i was there. and several of you have told me that i am still ""suffering"" or ""not over it,"" but truth be told... family just isn't something you *have* to love. i was never ""cared"" for. every piece of clothing i got until i was 15 came from my older brother. i made my own food. i taught myself how to fucking write by watching my sister do her homework! i was abandoned, essentially, and that does hurt. it hurts more than anything i will probably ever experience. 

but it's over, and i am done with that part of my life. i have an amazing boyfriend that (i hope) will propose to me soon, we're moving to new york at the end of this year, and we have two cats (malala and nelly) who are our children. i have amazing friends, i teach amazing students, and i have an amazing career that i love waking up and going to every single day. when people ask me where i'm from, i tell them i'm from a small town in tn. when i'm asked about my family, i tell them that i don't speak with them any more, but that they're nice people. they really are nice; my mom loves to decorate the house and my dad knows everything about agriculture like it's second nature. my oldest brother may not be the most morally-conscious man, but he's a nice man. my other brother that killed himself was really good at drawing -- he would have made it, too, if he had only been given help. my sister is... well, she's something. she can cook great food, probably giving gordon ramsay a run for his money! 

i don't deny the humanity that my family has; they are people who got the shit end of life, i don't ignore that. but when it comes down to it, i simply don't factor into their lives and i never will. and that's okay, because life has taken me all over this world. i wish i had a father to walk me down the aisle and a mother i could hug, but i don't. but do you know what i do have? 

my life. 

thank you guys so much for listening to me gripe and whine. it has been extremely cathartic to get it all out. ",11
"chubby boys.... as a girl i have to ask - why are big boys so underappreciated?? they're the best. 


boys who have extra fluff and who aren't ripped? *ooooooh*

the dad bod? yes. 

the d-lineman-with-more-marshmallow-than-muscle-bod? *absolutely.*

it pisses me off that guys are insecure about their weight but no one realizes it because it's not socially mainstream for guys to be insecure.

big boys: i love you. you're amazing. ♥️♥️",11
"i have to lie about why i became an emt, or i'd probably get fired.. i apologize in advance for the gross details.

so i've been an emt for a year now, i work critical care, and honestly it's amazing. i love everyday of it, from the moment i put on the badge to the moment a late call comes in and i have to stay late to pick up a patient two hours away. i love it all. 

but a part of me really hates that i lie about why i got into the business. i tell people it's ""always been a dream of mine"" or something like that, which is true, in a way. but that's far from the real reason why i got clean and got my degree in ems. 

about 2 years ago, me and my friends (still very close with them) we're doing acid again, had tripped so much i had lost count by then, and long story short, it was the worst trip of my life. the details of the whole thing isn't important, but, the last thing i remember, was balled up in the fetal position on my bathroom floor not being able to collect my thoughts or breathe on my own (or so i thought) and i started to have a hallucination of paramedics busting through my bathroom door, performing cpr, checking for a pulse, etc.  

when i woke up a few hours later, i was in my bed, suffocating on my own vomit, but somehow, for reasons unknown, i didn't die that night. i woke up, covered in my own vomit, not being able to breathe and immediately threw up on the floor beside my bed, trying to get a breath of fresh air. after cleaning myself up, coming down from the high, and collecting my thoughts, the image of the two paramedics stuck with me. even after these past two years, memories from that night fade away by the hour, but the image of those two paramedics, even with them being a hallucination, their image is burned into my brain. 
when i was at my lowest i had ever been, this manifestation of medics in my own drug induced panic attack set me on a path i have yet to look back from. 

so now, looking back at that experience, i'm glad it happened. i highly doubt i'd be where i am today if i hadn't hit that point in my life. to myself, i'm proud of that. i'm proud that i pulled myself back from that and made something of myself from such an experience as that, but it hurts me every time someone asks why i even became an emt in the first place, and i know if i tell them the truth, they'd think less of me, see me as a liability, or think i don't belong in this job field.

thanks for listening. be safe out there.

update: i never expected to get so many genuine comments and support from everyone, so thank you to those who did, it does really mean a lot to me",11
"you are the worst, slimiest types of people and i absolutely hate you. i posted a thing recently on legaladvice about my brother and it got a lot of attention. i reported my brother for him spying on me and putting a camera in my room and then violating a temporary restraining order and my religious catholic parents took his side and disowned. they burnt my shit and cursed me out. i'm very alone right now and its really been one of the worst times in my life.

i got so many messages, like hundreds upon hundreds of messages. i only responded to like three or four and had a really long phone conversation with this incredibly nice university professor across the country who was one of the nicest people i've ever met, she just put my mind at total ease. but man. 

so many people, like about fifty or sixty messages worth, all from catholics and christians, who just want to add in these little defenses, have to get the pr team in, make sure i'm not mad at jesus, that i know that real christians don't do this.

""that wasn't christianity, they aren't real catholics.""

""however, i want you to know that there are a lot of christians out there who love you. they would love for you to reach out to them. don't let someone else's atrocities keep you from happiness, family, and salvation."" (low key saying i deserve to go to hell)

""you can't let the sins of others doom you. it isn't what christ wants for you.""

""your parents are not acting even remotely catholic.""

""i've found peace and truth within the church, you can too.""

""this isn't representative of christians, i promise.""

all real quotes, copy and pasted.

what a load of crap. the only person who has ever hurt or betrayed me in a way worse than my family is doing now was a priest. i haven't actively tried to think about this for years but i'm just so angry at this attitude. don't bullshit me. it's perfectly representative of catholicism and you know it. its a religion that encourages ultimate deference to authority and instituinal power and that everyone is a total piece of shit who deserves horrible things to happen to them.

why is your first instinct when someone has these problems to make sure that the church isn't in trouble. it's the church we need to worry about, right? the church? always the church. can't make the church look bad, can't let jesus look bad, can't make god look bad nope nope nope. sorry you had a problem but whats important is that you remember that the church doesnt encourage this.

this is the only thing that makes me mad like this. look at the news with pennsylvania. my parents defended that stuff just like they defended my pious good catholic brother, i'm sure all these people did too. you don't give a crap about other people. you don't give a crap about anything except protecting religions image so you don't have to think about the fact that it might not be real and that real people might be suffering real abuses because of your support. 

never listening to this crap again. i really tried having a more positive attitude about this and people in general in the last few years but i don't care anymore. i'm so goddamn mad.

"sneaking around behind my fiancee's back, literally.... it's been going on for nearly two years, and it happens multiple times per week. but you've gotta understand, my fiancee loves to cook dinner and she'll often spend days planning and preparing fun meals for us both to enjoy. it's adorable, actually. and appreciated. but early on in our cohabitating relationship i began questioning our future together because everything she made would look so mouthwatering, but would mysteriously taste totally flat, or worse, unedible. after creeping in on a few of her cooking sessions, i eventually came to the realization that she never added salt while preparing anything. she always adds a fair amount of shakes to her plate, so it can't be a dietary concern. so i tried subtly dropping a suggestion here and there without being condescending (i hope). but like a complete coward, too weak to have one difficult conversation with the woman i love, i started salting right behind her back. every meal she cooks. all the necessary steps requiring salt. and she's even in the kitchen when i do it. and i really can't believe i'm admitting this, but i actually ordered a secret salt shaker on amazon and had it delivered to my office. to think, if a few inches taller, she'd be able see the two-year-long lie we've been living, hidden right among the travel mugs.",11

"i despise the baby boomer generation.. i hate these people they are the most self serving, entitled, inconsiderate and rude people of all time. the boomers just take up space and suck up resources. lived with all the advantages the greatest generation afforded them and then just shit on everything and everyone else. they are terrified of everything and so selfish they want nothing left for the next generations and want to ruin the planet before they drop dead. they smoked, drank, snorted everything and drove up the insurance by everyone having to cover their health costs from partying in the 60s and 70s. now they vote against anyone else having the same options afforded to them because they got theirs.  i pretend to not hate them and just try to not have to deal with them.

"a kind older gentleman was giving me advice on the best battery brand... little did he know i was getting them for my dildo.. i was at the store, exhausted from my workout and just wanted to head home. 
 

my last item to get was batteries for my dildo. i walked up and grabbed the first set i saw which was energizer. i put them in my cart and nearly walked away when a sweet old man said ""i would get duracell if i were you, they last much longer."" i cracked a smile and switched the batteries to duracell in which he said ""when it comes to important things like flashlights and such you just can't compromise on quality."" i nodded with a big grin and said ""thank you, the less frequently i have to buy batteries, the better.""

since i was trying with every fiber of my being to withhold my laughter, he probably thought i was high or something. 

but anyway, thank you sir. it indeed was for something important! 😬😂

i've received lots of good advice which i'll be looking into lol.

"found out i'm hiv-positive on my 21st birthday. i went back home at 11pm after a small birthday party with my close friends. i had my first legal drink.

my parents called me while i was checking my social networks and emails to see if anyone remember my birthday. 

i opened an email from my school's laboratory where i had a free blood test some weeks ago.

the results says i'm hiv positive.

i told my parents that i'm tired and drunk and need to go to bed. 

i checked the results one more time, went to bed, couldn't sleep. 

i can't tell my parents at least for now. we are catholic. i'm gay.

about a year ago, i had my first sex. unprotected. my partner who is a friend of my friend told me he's clean. we enjoyed it. after that day, we've never talked again.  

some weeks after my first sex. i noticed some weird problems in my body. i got effected by a small cut on my leg. i had swollen lymph nodes. i know i could have hiv already. but i was not brave to confront it. i didn't go testing my blood.

after that, i felt healthy again.

i prayed a lot.

never had sex since then.

last month i decided to test my blood. i was so scared.

and i got the result last night on my 21st birthday. 


updated: 
i just got home from school and feel so grateful for the love you've shared. 

just to clarify: to see the test result, i had to log in and go through several confirmations such as my info, id, etc. they also provide me information and support or so. btw i live in the us.

i feel a little better now. i don't think i will tell my parents. so i need a job to afford the medication. i will go to see a doctor next week.  my life will change from this point for sure.

"i'm tired of ""i don't care"" culture.. shutting people down for making progress or being empathetic about issues important to them isn't nice. being apathetic/staying jaded isn't cool. making no effort to care for the well-being of yourself, of others, of the planet, is not something that should be glorified or normalised. 

i'm tired of seeing people being shut down when talking about their passions or growth. i'm tired of seeing this ""i don't care, no one cares"" culture being perpetuated in this generation as edgy or cool. i'm tired of people using mental illness as an excuse to stay apathetic and excuse their detrimental behaviours. 

as someone who's struggled and is still struggling with depression, i mean in no way to belittle those who struggle with apathy as a symptom of mental illness, but i don't see it as a valid excuse to normalise it because it shouldn't be normal to feel this way. and it shouldn't be okay to tell others that it's okay to stay depressed because everyone else is depressed. 

it shouldn't be okay to encourage extreme nihilism and belittle other's passions and hobbies because of a ""nothing matters we all die"" mantra. this is the shit that makes people feel suicidal cause every time they try to bring up something that's important to them it get shut down for ""having no meaning"". this isn't behaviour that should be normalised or taught to the newer generation.

strive for empathy. be kind. be passionate. be attentive. show empathy for other people's passions, no matter how trivial it may seem to you. encourage growth, in yourself and others, however small. 

i know it's difficult to stay positive and passionate when so much terrible shit is happening around the world, but that's what makes it even more important. there's a lot of good that's happening in the world too, and there's a lot of good that can be done by addressing the bad, rather than just giving up and accepting reality as it is.

i'm tired of ""i don't care"" culture, and my resolution is to start by addressing it first. in myself and those around me.",11
"if you still support trump you're ruining my country. i've never let politics be divisive. i have great debates on policy with friends over beers and that's a debate every american should be having. i don't even care if you voted for trump, hillary wasn't a great candidate either. 2 years after the election though there's something seriously wrong if you still support him.

when it comes to this asshat now it's so much more than just policy, it's the meta stuff he's doing to my country. the play book he's using is the exact playbook every fascist has used before him and it's insane to me how many people just turn a blind eye to this.

the biggest thing is his promotion of, ""you're either with me or against me."" he attacks anyone that doesn't follow him in an easy, repeatable way that is so obviously a form of brain washing. 

fake news was the first one. every news is fake except fox, unless nyt posts something good about the economy. the constant repetition of fake news this fake news that leads to more and more people denouncing what our eyes are seeing and instead blindly following whatever trump says. even yesterday he tweeted he wants a state run media to tell us all the good things about america, and people liked that idea! hitler did it with lugenpresse, stalin denounced the media as ""enemy of the people, and now trump is doing the exact same thing.

now that he knows mueller's coming he's tweeting more and more about angry mueller and his gang of dems, using that exact same phrasing every single time. he'll also actively attack his political opponents. ""the liberals will open your borders and comey is ruining the lives of great people.""

how more blatantly obvious does he have to be than saying the cia, fbi, cable news, and the opposing political party are the lying enemies but russia, saudi arabia and anyone who spews his propaganda are allies we should take their word for? 

he's also utilizes bigotry fear and hatred for political gain. ""be scared of the caravan 900 miles away!"" you know what happened to it the day after the election. vanished. it's not our problem anymore. ""we also have to build a wall or else the lying dems will let all of the mexican rapists in."" 

he's even putting his family in positions of power! kushner and ivanka have no place being anywhere near the whitehouse, but thats what fascists do.

he's even stacking the courts, rapidly filling appeals seats with partisan judges at a quicker rate than any president before him. he just appointed a stooge as the top cop in the country, and even if kavanaugh isn't a rapist just hearing how he speaks and acts shows he's not qualified to be a fucking supreme court lifer.

it's so blatantly obvious what he's doing. he's purposefully dividing us more than any president in history. he's playing on our innate fears and chipping away at our political infrastructure that helps keep us a democracy. it doesn't matter if you're a democrat or republican, if you still support this man you're either dumb or hate america.",11
"i'm a man and i just realized i was raped.. it's 4 am. i just woke from a dream that i was upset about my ex even though we broke up 7 years ago. i still sometimes get angry because she was physically abusive. anyways, in the dream, i talked to my mom about it, and she told me the reason i was upset was because diana was raping me. and i woke up so quickly because  then it clicked. 


she used to hit me most if i didn't have sex with her. she would cry, yell at me, and hit me until my ""no"" became a ""yes."" and it happened all the time. i've told people it was an abusive relationship before, i just never connected the dots. what she did was rape. and i think if i were a woman, i would have connected the dots sooner because someone would have picked up on it right away. but most people don't think of a man being raped and might be more dismissive of subtler things.

"thank you to those who donate to thrift stores. for context, i'm a college student in an extremely rural area (vermont usa) without a car or drivers license.  i have a job on campus but i only make $40 a week. i also don't have a family to help support me or buy necessities. 

i have been super gluing and duct taping my winter boots together, because i simply don't have $40+ to buy a new pair. i've been extremely stressed about how i'm going to make it through the rest of the winter, because these boots are in tatters and there's still 3-4 months left of winter. 

today i went to a goodwill with low expectations since i wear a size 11 women's shoe. when i got there i managed to find a post-christmas miracle of practically brand new, nice quality, winter boots for $5. i don't know who donated them, but i wish i could thank them. they're donation is going to get me through this winter, and probably next years too. 

i buy most of my clothes in general from goodwill and other thrift stores. i don't know what i would do without them honestly. so thank you to everyone who donates, because i don't think you always realize how much you're helping your community.

i'm sleeping over right now and her dad was in the kitchen (i was getting some water), and we had a really fucking nice conversation. he mentioned a few programs i should look into about children of alcoholic parents, he just let me talk and fucking listened and didn't brush me off or ignore me like my family does.

"i'm dying and i don't know how to feel about it. when they first told me that i had cancer i thought that i would make it. i did make it for a while. things went alright and i went into remission when i was 18.

 things looked good and i started college as a film student in a 4 year university but by the age of 21 it came back and had was progressing rapidly. i ended up quitting school because it didn't seem like it was worth planning for a future that i wouldn't have. 

 i'm 22 now and recently was given an estimate of 4-6 months. i've been trying to stay strong for my family, but i'm so fucking scared.

 i'll be 23 years old when i die. there were so many things that i wanted to do that i'll never get the chance to do. 

 i feel like i should be trying to find some rhyme or reason, or rationalizing some sort of after life or a god, but i just want to stay in my room and play videogames.

 i love my family but i am tired of being around them, i see that they are trying to stay strong but i feel like i have to comfort them. they are also extremely religious and have tried to use this to make me a believer.

 i don't want to comfort people, or explain what i feel to people who won't get it, or be fucking preached to. 


 i pre-ordered red dead redemption two and my current goal is to stay healthy enough to beat it.  that's the one good thing about dying, i don't have to save my money or worry about my future. it my sound selfish but at this point i'm just trying to play as many videogames as possible and try not to think about any of it.

 times like this are rough though, it's 5 in the morning and i'm too tired to do anything. so i have a lot of thoughts popping up in my mind that i want to avoid.

 i'd like to say something inspiring to close my post out with, but i don't have anything like that unfortunately. i'm sorry for this long drawn out post, but typing it out made me feel a little better. besides, if you didn't care for my post what are you going to do? kill me. i'd like to see you try.

**edit:** holy shit you guys, i'm shocked by how much this blew up, thanks for all the support. you've all made me feel a lot better today than i did last night.

"my uncle thanked me for inviting him to my game that was years ago.. my great uncle (in his sixties) lost his only child several years ago to cancer. i only see this uncle, usually, during funerals or reunions. during the last one when i was around 15 years old, my mom invited him to see a basketball game of mine. 

this particular uncle is one of the most interesting people. he can tell you anything about history. his eyes light up and every so often he apologizes or checks to make sure he's not boring you. he can tell you things that aren't even in the history books about people in the american revolution. he's writing a book right now and we told him to email us a copy. i remember just talking about history at his mother's (my great grandmother) memorial. 

6 1/2 years ago, a couple weeks after that memorial, he came to one of my basketball games. if i'm correct, that's the last time i saw him. he was in the bleachers and he loves basketball. i was an awful player. i always remembered him coming though and i was glad he came.

yesterday we had my grandma's (his sister) memorial. i asked him to talk about history. he lit up and just started going! i loved it.

and what really touched me yesterday was this: he thanked me yesterday for us inviting him to that game that was years ago. his eyes became sad and he said how he was going through a very hard time at the time. i told him of course! but since then i've just thought about it. 

how thankful he was to come to a junior varsity high school basketball game and watch the worst player on the team. i didn't even like inviting people to watch me play because i was so bad, but when i mentioned that yesterday he said ""you were great! it was a wonderful time!""

it warmed my heart. afterwards i told his sister i'd send her a rick warren book because she went on and on about how much she loved billy graham. reach out to your older family members everyone, it means the world.


edit: added a few more details to the story! forgot to add that we were at his sisters memorial yesterday, etc

edit 2: he's still writing his book! it is very important to him that the details of the book are as true as can be so he has done a lot of researching and editing. so it might be a bit until it's ready but i'll let you all know!!

edit 3: thank you for all the kind comments. while we wait to read my uncle's book, make an excuse to talk to some of your older relatives. ❤️ they will not forget it and they may need it more than you know.",11
"so very lucky. my 12 year old has been having epic blood noses. i'm talking crime scene, carrie, the shining type blood noses. blood tests at the doc showed her iron levels were really low. another big bleed today and we headed to the hospital.

she was seen and assessed by 3 x nurses, 2 x doctors, and an ear nose and throat registrar. she was given 4 x different types of medication to try and stop the bleeding. she then had 3 x blood vessels in her nose cauterised. we left the hospital with a follow up appointment in 6 weeks time.

the whole thing from start to finish cost me $8 for parking. i don't have private medical insurance. 

i feel so bloody lucky to live in australia, no pun intended.",11
"i was so set on killing myself when i turned 18, i turned 20 today. god, i always thought i'd off myself on my 18th birthday. life fucking sucked, like really fucking sucked. and yet here i am, freshly turned 20, with new friends, more supportive parents, and 4 college applications sent in. never in my life did i expect to make it this far. managed to make it through abuse from both friends and family, am fighting through my depression, and realized that blood means nothing and i am allowed to cut family out of my life. man, it's been a rough few years, but fuck yeah me for surviving it.

"my dog and boyfriend are squishing me in bed right now and i feel so blessed.. we've been living on our own for around 3 months now and everything is still new and i know it's probably the honeymoon phase but this is just so amazing. my family is extremely emotionally manipulative and abusive, so i decided that i needed to move out as soon as it was financially possible and life has never been better. i've depressive episodes and anxiety since i was 11, i went from having a couple panic attacks a week to having none! i haven't had a full panic attack in over 2 months. money is a little tight but we are all happy and never go without, crying major happy tears right now! i never thought i'd make it this far, i've been told all my life that i'll never amount to anything and here i am with a good job and amazing little family!",11
"i told my 6-year-old daughter how rain actually works.. i overheard my very christian wife answering to her question, ""mommy, how does it rain?"" my wife said, ""god does it."" that's it. that's all she said. this made me angry.

shortly after, when my daughter and i were alone, i took her into the kitchen. ""i'll show you how rain works,"" i said. i poured water in the kettle and put it on the counter under the cupboards. ""dad, why are you boiling the water?""

""when water boils, it turns into steam. watch what happens when the steam goes on the cupboard."" eventually, there were little rain droplets on the cupboard above the kettle. ""come look,"" i said. she hurried over.

""is that rain?"" she asked. ""yes, that's rain. the water boiled and turned into steam. then it turned back into water on the cupboard. now it's dripping, like rain. outside, rain from the ocean boils and comes back down as rain.""

""but then what does the rain stick to when it boils in an ocean?""

""the rain sticks to the clouds.""

""why does the rain in the ocean boil?""

""the sun heats up the ocean.""

""oh i see. that's why puddles disappear, right?""

""yes.""

""i get it now. thanks dad,"" she said and hugged me.

it just pisses me off how my wife is trying to teach her ""god did it"" for everything. i don't want my daughter to be ignorant. sure, she can be a christian, but you can't just answer everything with that. she needs to learn.

thanks for reading.",11
"as of 33 minutes ago i am 2 months clean!. i'm not months clean from cutting, i don't really have anyone to share this information with, since my friends don't like talking to me very much.

i'd like to know some ways i can stop myself since i've been feeling worse lately.


thank you!",11
"i cleaned my house today after months of struggling with mental health. i cleaned my house today. i know it doesn't seem like a big feat to most but for me it is. my mental health has been been terrible lately, i haven't had the motivation to get out of bed besides getting coffee and be just social enough with my family so they don't worry too terribly about me. i just started a new depression medication and it's helped me get more motivation to talk more to friends and i even managed to leave the house yesterday to drive around. 
this morning i woke up and came out to my living room, (i moved back into my parents house after extreme thoughts of suicide.), and saw that the place was just really messy. and instead of ignoring the mess like usual, i cleaned. and organized. i swept the floors and wiped the kitchen counters. i even brewed coffee for my mother and i. 
i'm not here to tell my sob story. but i felt amazing after doing this because to me it symbolizes a new turn in the pages for me. my mom even noticed when she woke up and gave me a hug and a thank you. i'm on cloud nine right now. i still have progress to make, but for right now i feel really positive about where i'm at. 

(note; using mobile so if any formatting is off i apologize. i was just super excited to tell anybody how great i feel about myself right now.)

update: thank you all for your positive comments and even personal stories. i've read every single things you guys have to say. and thank you to the people who felt my story worthy of an award. i love all of you positive people. your support and stories have brought tears to my eyes (positive tears). you guys motivate me to stay positive in my battle.",11
"i'm in love with my best friend. an update.. follow up to this post here. (https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9dkxxd/im_in_love_with_my_best_friend/?st=jnj2mlof&sh=fdf0f992)

i took your guys' advice and waited a while to tell her. a week ago, i did. the result was unexpected. 

she told me she's had feelings for me for a while too. my heart jumped. i couldn't believe it. she was so incredibly happy that i said something. the way she smiled and tapped her feet (r/humantippytaps) made my heart melt. it was so cute. 

i kissed my best friend. i had sex with my best friend. i'm spending quality time with my best friend. 

i'm so unbelievably blessed to know someone like her, let alone have mutual feelings. sometimes, life just falls into place even in the darkest of times. 

to all those waiting to say something to someone, don't. you never know what the other side is thinking. i know i didn't. 

i will, down the road, continue updates of our journey together. 

edit: i am so fucking overwhelmed by the positivity on this post. i did not expect it to blow up this big, i was just so happy and had to share it somewhere (my friends are tired of me rambling about it). i love you all, seriously. this feels like a fairytale. i'm so glad i was able to shed some positive light into a world where it is scarce. <3",11
"to you. dear you,
to clarify, yes, i mean you, the person reading this. i don't know who you are, but instead of that being weird, i think that's a good thing. let me tell you a little something.

things happen, all the time. people come, people go, you say things you wish you hadn't and you regret things you never said. you do thing, you don't do things, and sometimes you wish you'd do more, while at other times you achieve the unachievable, we all do.

and let me tell you one thing. you are good. like really, genuinely good. whether you're struggling or not, up or down, you. are. good. life happens, sometimes it even feels like it passed you by, but you are here, you're walking among us and you, even if only sometimes, improve people's lives. 

whether you are someone i see everyday, my best friend even, or if i only saw a meme you posted once in my life, you matter to me, and to everybody else. 

stay strong, stay positive, but mostly, stay you.

love,
thorvals

"i've finally earned my bachelor's degree!. it has taken me a full 7 years but i've officially finished as of this morning. i enrolled in college back in august 2012, but had some personal and financial setbacks along the way. it almost feels like a dream that my transcript actually lists my degree as 'earned' that i've had to reload the page to make sure it really says it. there were times when i thought i shouldn't even bother to finish it, especially because i was already able to get a decent job without my degree last year. i'm so relieved i didn't quit because this is a great feeling.

edit: thank you to everyone who has commented for your sincerely kind words and whomever gave this post silver. and to everyone who has shared a similar story and are still in school, i am so thankful to read about your academic journeys and i'm moved that my post could provide even a little hope or inspiration for you.   you've all got this! i can't wait to read your future happy posts about graduating.",11
"my fiance's parents got me a watch and i'm so emotional.. i'm really emotional right now so sorry if this doesn't really make sense. 

when i was a kid, my parents abused me. i had a sister who died when i was 12, and then my older brother started abusing me too. it was such a rough time for me. more backstory in my other posts.

anyways, when i started junior high, i met this girl katelyn. she's now my fiance. she's the best person i've ever met, and i love her to death. i guess we're high school sweethearts. we've been together since we were 16 and have plans to get married later this year. 

i couldn't be at home a lot growing up. either my family was home being terrible to me, or they were out of town, and i was alone in the house. either way, i hated being there. so i spent a lot of time (whenever i could get away, my parents were very controlling) at my friends houses, particularly katelyn's, because her family was (and is) so awesome. (the exception is her older sister, but i'm not going to talk another her because she's not/was never around a lot) 

katelyn's family has always been so kind to me. even when they didn't know what was going on (i didn't tell katelyn about anything until we were about to graduate high school) they treated me like family, and i really needed that. i couldn't be at their house all the time, but when i could, they'd let me. it was really great.

anyways, today is my birthday. i'm 25 now, incase you were wondering. katelyn and i live together in an apartment. life is going great for me now, for the most part.

i never celebrated my birthday growing up. i didn't even know when it was until i was like 14. but katelyn's family is big on celebrating them. up until this year i'd made katelyn swear not to throw a party or even get a gift for me, because i didn't want one. it would feel awkward, at least that's how i felt. but this year (actually inspired by someone on reddit) when katelyn asked if i wanted to do something, i agreed, though i still didn't want a huge party. she was so excited. 

we went out to dinner with her parents and brothers, and it was awesome. we went to her parents house after and had cake, and talked for a while. right before we were about to leave, her parents pulled me aside and gave me a box. they asked me to open it.

it was a watch. i have a watch, but it's not a *nice* watch. i got it at target or somewhere for as cheap as can be, years ago. the watch they gave me was a rolex. an expensive one. 

katelyn's dad explained to me that when each of his kids had grown up, he bought them a nice watch, to remind them that they always had their parents as a backup, and they'd always be there for them, to help them, just like a watch is right there on your wrist when you need to tell the time. 

i pretty much started crying. 

my parents never gave me anything. i never had any expectations of getting anything tonight, especially not from katelyn's parents, i guess just because of my parents, idk it's hard to explain. 

it's hard seeing katelyn hug her parents, and to hear them tell her they love her. sometimes, i wish i had that too. but i guess i do, just not with my parents. it just makes me so emotional to know that they'll be there to support me, and that they love me. i don't need my real fucking parents. they hated me anyway. thanks for reading, i'm a mess right now lol

edit: wow this blew up. i woke up this morning and checked reddit (i've been into the sub recently and wanted to see if there were any new posts lol) and i had 100+ notifications! it's taken me all day (with breaks of course) to read through every comment, but i did. thank you guys so much, it means so much to me that you all care. i'm so happy. i've been in such a good mood since last night, and i think it's going to last a while. i love my future in laws. my heart goes out to everyone who shared their similar stories with me.

someone said in a comment; ""never forget to smile"". i love that. i'll remember that. i hope you all do too. 

and i know now that ""fiance"" is for a male, and ""fiancee"" is for a female. i would go back and correct everything, but i'm too lazy to look for where i said it honestly. sorry if it bugs you. i'll use it correctly in the future though.",11
"my dad just told me he was raped. (hi, it's the first time i'm posting something and english is not my first language so i apologize)

my dad is a very reserved person when it's about his problems but we are very close and we talk about our problems and feelings all the time when we are alone. 

today me(22f) and my dad (53) went to the bank take care of some important stuff for my scholarship. while we were waiting a woman passed and out of nothing, he says ""her sister was my first time, i was still a kid"" i asked him how young, he answered ""9 but i was ""forced"" "". 
i just got completely silent, i didn't and still don't know how to react, i feel like it's the first time he told this to someone, my dad is the strongest person i know and now, in my eyes he's even stronger. i love you dad.",11

"i paid back all of my student loans today. i am 1yr and 3mo post graduation, and this morning i made my very last student loan payment! $24k in total.

i don't have anyone that would really care or be excited for me, but i've sacrificed so much this year to try and make this happen that i just feel a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders!!

i feel like i can finally start saving and working towards my next goals; like taking time off work if i need a mental health day or something. maybe start a new hobby. it really is the small things in life. i am grateful i can finally put this behind me.

-cheers

edit: wow! thank you so much everyone for the kind words and encouragement. i'm always amazed by the kindness of strangers. 

for those of you asking, i graduated with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering and was able to land a job in a relatively low cost of living area. i would be making considerably more in a city, but the cost of living offsets that wage gap for the most part.",11
"a friend/housemate got caught by ice and i finally have to confront this issue.. he was the hardest working dude i've known in a long time.  he left the house before i even woke up, and would get back long after i had started drinking my beers.  i have a steady job and he eclipsed me in hours worked.  his work was thankless and he never complained.  i don't think his workplace will be able to replace him.  he was good at his craft.  great at his craft.

he didn't drink.  didn't do drugs.  didn't even own a car.  just worked hard and made money for his family.  he has been in america for longer than i've been alive.  he never collected food stamps, won't get social security, didn't go through our schools or daycares.  he paid his taxes without complaint.  well, a little complaining, but he paid nonetheless.  i had a stronger connection with him than any of my neighbors, but somehow i am to believe that he is less worthy of being my friend than the assholes down the street who sit on their porch all day drinking and fighting.

i never really had to think about the human impact of these laws, but i had to confront them today.  we lost a great member of our community because he was born on the other side of some imaginary line.  

this is wrong.

edit:  this blew up a bit.  i was very upset last night and i really just needed someone to hear what had happened, i needed to share this.  i'm no philosopher and i don't have any political gains here.  i just want someone to hear about a man, a good man, was caught up in the gears of a weird machine and that i'm having a hard time having reality match up with theory.  if this story spoke to you then perhaps take a moment to reflect on other stories similar to this that may be happening in your community.  may you find peace today.",11
"i let him touch me.. sometimes the most intimate touch isn't necessarily sexual in nature. 
years ago, i was in an abusive relationship. the guy i was with broke into my home, and threw my hair straightener (at full force) into my bathtub (while it was hot) in an attempt to intimidate me. when that didn't work he proceeded to physically abuse me. he didn't ""want"" to punch or slap me, because that would leave black eyes and bruises (he left massive bruises anyway). instead, he grabbed me by my arms and wrists and drug me through the house calling me every insult known to man while doing it. 

he got me into my bedroom.

he locked the door.

he threw me on the bed.

he towered over me, and he proceeded to straddle me. once he had the full weight of his body securing me in place, he pinned my elbows down with his knees. 

then he hurt my soul.

he squeezed my face by my jaw. he left dents in my cheeks. he brought my face impossibly close to his as i struggled against him, and validated every single one of my insecurities with screams. he suddenly stopped, looked down at my defenseless body, and smiled. his eyes went cold. i could feel his erection on my abdomen.

""i could do anything i want to you right now.""

i still shudder when i think about it. luckily, my parents chose that particular day to visit me, so when he heard the car doors, he got startled enough to get off of me. i exhaled the breath i didn't know i'd been holding and ran for the door. i later learned he'd fled through the window.

*i cannot bear to let anyone touch my face because of this*

last night was the first time in a long time that i let someone touch my face. it was the most sincere, gentle form of affection i'd ever experienced. i was so exposed.... i felt beautifully vulnerable. it was so intimate, and that moment was ours and ours alone. he tamed that suffocating fear in a way i never thought possible, and answered the prayer i didn't know i'd prayed.
thank you for letting me share. ❤️",11
"lady at starbucks. this was a week ago and i never said anything but i kept meaning to. you were in the car in front of me and my boyfriend and we were about to pay with 2 almost empty gift cards and change. i know we shouldn't be buying starbucks if we can't pay easily, but we're broke and tired college students. we got to the window and had our gift cards and change ready to hand to the cashier and then they said the woman in front of us had paid for us on account that we have a good day. you made our day. there are days i really lose faith in humanity, but you still like to pay it forward and that reminds me to still have some hope in humanity. thank you lady in front of us at starbucks. thank you so much.",11
"i'm gay. i'm a 29 year old woman. i have been married to a man for 8 years and i have recently realized that i am gay.

i guess over the years, there were indications. i thought that i was generally asexual for the most part because i typically don't find men attractive at all.

any sexual fantasies, i never included myself. it was always through a third party lens with a focus on the woman, or from the male perspective.

when i realized this, i began giving into this mentally and just imagining myself with women instead and i found that i have very strong visceral responses to women. i didn't think i was able to feel this level of arousal or attraction before,.

i have come to accept that i am gay. i have not said these words to anyone, including myself, until now. 

i don't know what to do now, because i do love my husband. i don't know what my next steps are but i did need to say it.

but i arranged for my best and closest friends to come to my house, and i bought all the food, and some drinks, just to chill out and celebrate with me, with no financial burden to anyone at all. and i told them about it a month a go too. 
two of the 15 people i invited is actually coming. 
and i'm so sad that some are 'too tired' or 'not feeling it' when it's their birthday i always try and show face, even for a drink or half hour, and now i'll sit at home like i do every other day, nothings new.

please just give me the damn recipe. every time i google a recipe i gotta scroll through someone's fuckin life story and 15 pictures of the food before i can even get the damn recipe?  how did this happen?!,11
"an inside look at mcdonald's.. full disclosure, i am a worker, soon to be ex worker, at a corporate owned mcdonalds. and of all the jobs i've worked in my life, mcdonalds is probably the hardest i have worked at. i've broken down twice in my year working there due to stress and customers. 

on reddit i see a lot of people angry at mcdonald's and the people who work there, and it makes me sad, cause even though i hate the corporation mcdonalds, i love my coworkers, who are hard working. and when people talk about mcdonalds, they lump us in with the corporation, even though we are just people trying to make a decent enough wage to live, just like you. it's a job, just like yours, except our job somehow allows others to treat us like shit. now this isn't true in all situations, i'm sure there's an abundance of horribly ran mcdonalds out there, but again, we are all lumped into one thing. 

the mcdonalds i work at has a car count of around 80 cars per hour, on a slow day. assuming you work full time like most of the employees do, that's an average of 640 cars per day. that means 640 times of ""how may i help you"", 640 different orders, 640 people coming through drive thru alone. mcdonalds also puts immense pressure on our supervisors to get the people in and out of drive through under a minute and a half from when you order. time out a minute and a half as you read the rest, to give you a understanding of how fast that truly is. 

1st step, ordering your meal: mcdonalds is run on a pos team basis. that means there's several different positions in mcdonalds whose main communication with each other is a pos system, basically a screen that lists out your order. when you place an order you talk to ot 1 (or 2 depending on which lane you are giving your order in).  ot 1 is responsible for taking your order accurately, reading back your order to make sure it is correct, taking cash for your order, and giving you the right change back. that's not too hard if it's only one customer at a time, but again, 80 cars is the count for an hour, roughly 1 and a half cars per minute, so there's often overlap. that means as ot 1, you have to be listing the order of whoever is out side your window, while also listening to whoever is giving you their order outside the speaker. you have to be taking the customers cash while also clarifying and entering another customers order at the same time. you have to be giving the right change back while also telling another customer there total. and both customers want your full attention. you stop asking ""anything else"" for more than 10 seconds, and the customer will shout ""hello"" at you. you pause taking cash so you can ask questions about a particular order, then the customer outside your window will give you looks and blame you for making them late. and god forbid you mix up an item from the order of the person at your window with the person whose at your speaker, then you are labeled a moron and talked down to. it's a rough position, but honestly i prefer it over the others. 

2nd step, making your meal: so assuming ot 1 takes your order down accurately and charges you for the right order, it is then given to kitchen. they have to make your order in less than a minute, and again because of overlap, they often are making the orders of 2 other peoples orders as well. (btw for those keeping track, a minute and a half has ran out around this part). i don't know enough about this position because i only got to work kitchen like two times, but it can be hard with so many different customizations. i know the lady's i work with are on top of it though. 

step 3, bagging your meal: so given they make your order and the orders of the car ahead and behind you, the food is then pushed through to a heated holding place for the ""runner"" to bag correctly. this is usually a job that managers will do because it's not something for the new people to try. so as a runner, you have a screen that lists all the items of a certain order in front of you, as well as all the orders that you have in drive thru at the moment. it is your job to make sure the item you are bagging are in the same order. now because different sandwiches takes different times due to if kitchen is out of any items because so many people ordered the same thing, sometimes you will get passed a couple sandwiches from the first order, then maybe one sandwich from the next, and then maybe a couple for front counters orders, and maybe a few extra as well. you have to sort through these and choose the correct one for that order. choosing wrong means an angry customer, or an angry kitchen, or both. you also are responsible for making sure fries are plenty or else you run out. it is also your job to decide if a car should be parked or not. a reason you might do this is because you have to get these cars out of drive thru, and the car at the window ordered 6 hamburgers, but the car behind them only ordered a soda. you don't have the hamburgers but the soda is ready, so you park the burgers and get the soda out of line. or if you are out of fries, then all the orders with fires have to wait 2 minutes for fresh fries, but the orders without fries can get their food and go. you tell the presenter (the person who hands you your food) to park a car by pressing a button, again, little communication between the two. 

step 4, receiving your meal: so let's say the runner has your food ready and bags it correctly, no mistakes. it is then passed to the presenter. the presenter is the person who is at the second window and is responsible for getting your drinks for you as well as checking your bag to make sure they are handing you your order and not the person behind you. they also are the ones who will have to park you if there's something wrong with your order. it's a little bit less stressful because your not multitasking up the ass, but harder because you are face to face with the customers, and boy do they like to shoot the messenger. this is the position i've been screamed at the most. even though i didn't take your order, didn't make your order, didn't bag your order or decide to park you, the customer will always see it as my fault if something isn't to their liking. i've been yelled at for parking people, and have been yelled at for not parking people by the customers behind them. i've been yelled at because the bag handed to me by the runner didn't contain the right burgers, even though all i have time for is a quick spot check to see if it looks right. i've been yelled at because the order the ot1 charged you for was not yours. i've been yelled at for the fact that your hamburger does contain pickles, even though you ordered it without. i have had no part in any of those problems, and yet i am the martyr. the only thing you can yell at me for that i actually did mess up on is whether your drink is correct, and whether it isn't, in fact, you order from the one i choose from among 5 different orders. and by all means you are free to do so. 

now again, 80 cars per hour is on a slow day, most of our rush times (between 8am-10 am, and between 11am -2 pm) can get anywhere from 130 cars to 180. because of the drastic amount of people and the minimal amount of time we are given to get you your order, mistakes are made. we are humans, who cannot do 130 orders absolutely correctly the first time through every hour for 8 hours. it's not possible. if there is a mistake, often i am partial to the customer and do my best to get you your correct order or a refund if you request. however, again people lump us together with the corporation, and act as though we lazily make a burger and throw it to them, instead of the high pressure jobs we are actually doing. i've had managers threaten to call the cops because of the aggression customers show to us because of one mistake. we always hope customer are understanding, and treat us as humans who make mistakes, and not automated robots, but that's not the reality of the situation. almost every mistake we make is received by the customer as a personal slight, and they make sure their disdain is known by taking it out on us. i think it's been hardwired into people to just assume we're going to fuck up, most likely because out of the 640 customer we had through drive thru alone, you might be part of the 10% of people's whose orders we messed up, twice. i know it's annoying, and i am truly sorry and want to help, but please don't shout at me and call me names/cuss me out because something went wrong. 
i am not a nameless mcdonalds employee. 
i am sammy. 
i'm a 21 year old female, trying to get a degree in computer programming, who could only find a job that pays me 9.25 an hour and works me to the bone. 
i am a daughter, and a sister, and a friend. 
i am human just like you. 
please treat me like one.

tl;dr: the thing i'm trying to get across is to not direct your frustration with mcdonalds out on poor hardworking people, take it up with the corporation. honestly i'd probably be behind you.

edit: now with paragraphs!

edit 2: holy cow! i wrote this rant at 3 am last night. i had to come to work at 6, so i am still reasonably tired! i'm on break now and seeing this blow up makes me super happy! to all those who are or was in the same position, it's nice to hear that we are all united in some way or another haha! i want to respond and upvote all your posts, but i have like 10 minutes to eat! thank you for you're attention, and know that you are heard! also thank you so much for the gold and silver random strangers!",11
"please be gentle with him.. i just dropped my dad off at the airport. it's his first plane ride in forever, his first vacation without my mom (she died more than a decade ago). i am so worried for him. i feel like the world is a more fast paced, impatient place. i am terrified of him needing help and some shit head making fun of him on social media. 

my dad is an easy going guy that wanted to have a short birthday trip. please, please please, universe, let things go smoothly. 



update: it's about 11 pm where i am. thank you to everyone for the kind messages. i definitely teared up at some of your comments. 

my dad sent me a few texts throughout the day and he's currently getting settled in for the night. i am at his house with his dogs and they are confused as to why he's not coming through the door. 

he seems to be having a good time so far. he's excited that he beat his step goal for the first time in a long time. he's in vegas so hopefully he won't get into too much trouble. 

if you run into a sixty something dad that talks your ear off about texas sports teams, the fall tv lineups, or his stint in the navy, then it's probably him. 

my brother and i are looking forward to seeing his pictures and hearing all about his trip when he gets back on thursday. 

have a good night, reddit. you are good people. ",11
too embarrassed to celebrate. today i hit my weight loss goal of losing 50lbs which perfectly aligns with my bmi lowering to 29.9. so i'm not obese anymore! i worked my ass off. exercising an hour and a half everyday and drastically changing my diet. but i can't bring myself to tell anyone bc it's embarrassing that i was 50lbs into obesity. maybe y'all can celebrate with me!,11
"i did laundry and brushed my teeth this morning. a few months ago, i left a relationship after suffering physical, sexual, and verbal abuse. my life has kinda been all over the place since then. bouncing in and out of relationships that aren't good for me and ignoring what i really needed, time for me. 

i stopped my meds during that time as well. i just kinda lived life a bit recklessly... things got out of control. 

ff to now:
today, i restarted my meds and wanted to change everything going on. i did laundry this morning and changed my sheets (3 loads, for one person, is a lot).  i also brushed and flossed my teeth, and am planning to take a shower. i also want to get to the dishes and vacuum, but we will see how that goes. 

i know these are little tasks that should be routine but they are things that become difficult when suffering from depression and bipolar. 

i don't have anyone to tell since i keep an image up that everything is fine... so thanks for listening reddit. 

until next time...",11
"finally saw the ex that smashed my heart three years ago. he asked me if i was happy.. and i didn't even have to lie. i didn't even have to pretend. 

he wanted ""closure"". so he had me over and we talked. he asked me if i still thought of him. he had a look in his eyes that said he wanted to hear yes. and i said no. again, i didn't even lie. 

we dated for a year. we were friends when we were little and the relationship, to me, seemed perfect. until he demanded to know where i was all the time, making me share my location with him and would ask me why i wasn't going to the gym anymore. he didn't realize he had flung me into a depression and i just thought he really really loved me. i was clueless. 

he broke up with me a week after i got my long hair cut above my shoulders, citing that as a reason. oh and it was christmas eve. oh and we had just had sex. like. pillow talk ""do you love me? i don't think i love you.""

ruined me. i remember two months later i was still crying any moment i got alone with myself. i remember thinking ""holy shit it's february and the first thing i do when i come home is collapse and cry."" i took a lot of baths and drank a six pack of beer a night. i started treating it like a hobby and got a new craft beer each night. i was pathetic. 

then in may, i asked a guy i had known for years prior if he wanted to hang out. 100% booty call. i was done crying about a month prior and ready for some human contact. little did i know this tall dark and handsome dude i was reaching for had a crush on my homely self the entire time i've known him. 

he treated me the exact opposite. loved my short hair. never looked through my phone. never asked how long i was out the night prior and so on. he treated me better than anyone who ever claimed to love me has. we constantly laughed and he held me extra tight when i cried.

i'm still so in love. so much that my ex never crosses my mind. sure if i see him and his new girl on fb i'll do the whole ""poor girl"" thing under my breath but that's because that manipulation i went through fucked me up. i realized the stark contrast when he said if his girl found out i was there she'd flip, when the entire time i just wanted to tell my boyfriend about it. 

then today, i get asked for lunch. he tells me he shouldn't have hurt me. he tells me his new girl is even more controlling that he was to me and he had been thinking about me and how i must have felt. he told me i was the best sex he's ever had and that he never has sex with her. he divulged a lot. i just wanted to leave and not breathe the same air as him or be in his stale/sexless house. 

so when he asked if i was happy, i told him that i spent months thinking about him after he hurt me and that i eventually got sick of thinking about him. i said that breaking my heart was the catalyst to the happiest i have ever been. 

i don't think he got the closure he wanted. but i did. 

thanks <3",11
"my (now ex) boyfriend thought my business was going nowhere. i've made over 12k a month these past 3 months. i have no degree.. tldr: my (thankfully ex) boyfriend and his mother made me feel absolutely worthless in the two years i was with him. made me feel like shit for not having a degree or having a more ""prestigious"" career path. i worked blood sweat and tears to build a salon with him discouraging me and nickel-and-diming me every chance he could even though he made more than i did at his civil servant job. 

i broke up with him, opened my business (in october) and now make more in a month than he makes in almost 4. 

details: 

his mom came from ridiculous amounts of money and had everything paid for including her degree, which she never used because her husband she met in college had a great job and took care of her. she also has massive inheritance and oil money residuals every month rolling in.

she shit on me not having a college degree, even though i had no one to help me and also was alone in taking care of my disabled grandmother. i had to pick up a trade (cosmetologist esthetician) just to take care of us and earn above minimum wage to survive. 

my ex also had his fancy degree and everything paid for, and he doesn't even have gratitude for this. he doesn't even use it, as he chose to be a firefighter (not a bad thing, just emphasizing the irony).

glossing over 2 years of serial cheating, lying, inviting exes over to his apartment while i was working, gaslighting, and constant verbal and emotional abuse, this piece of work would nickel and dime me as much as he could.  

$20 bill at a breakfast place? itemizing everything. won't let me even have toast off his plate unless i contributed to the meal (it was a form of ""stealing from him""). even if he ate or drank more than i did? 50/50 split in all bills. refused to take almost any day trip or vacation because he didn't want to pay his half.  conveniently forgot his wallet several times when it was time to pay.

all this time he is staying in my house rent utility and expense free. 

his reasoning? women take jobs from men now that we are in the workforce, so i should be paying more than half...wish i was making this shit up.

he would always shit on me about how my business wasn't a real job, how it took too much time from him, how it wasn't exactly prestigious and that it wasn't impressive.

his mother constantly made plans and events for the family and invited the other two girlfriends and would never invite me because i seemed ""fake"" (her reasoning? having a lip piercing, long nails, and at the time blonde hair. wtf). i just couldn't measure up to the 22 year old girlfriend of her youngest with aspirations to be a doctor.

this was especially hurtful because i really wanted a good relationship with her. my mother is a train wreck, i'm an only child, and my grandmother has severe dementia. i have no good female role models or functional parents in my life. she never gave me the fucking chance and it killed me. i had to hear second hand everything she said about me and how my boyfriend never stuck up for me.

anyway, i finally got wise, realized there was better quality men out there who would be supportive of me. there was.

lost 220 pounds in the form of a narcissistic loser who was at best a 6/10 and focused on my business. in 6 months my business has exploded. i am extremely grateful, tentatively excited, and i'll admit, slightly smug. i am happier than i have been in a long time and after a lifetime of a beans and rice budget i still can't believe what's happening.

fuck the haters, look out for yourself, and go be a bad ass.",11
"screw you radio ads that use honks, sirens, and crash noises. no seriously fuck you,

hardly anyone listens to radio stations outside of their vehicles, and you should already know that a majority of your audience is driving their car. so when i hear honks and sirens, i immediately freak. it blows my mind that this isn't illegal.

tldr; radio ads suck.",11
"i didn't realise it would be the last time.... i (f27) came down with a rank cold on friday and by the evening i felt well and truly awful. i had a cigarette, went to my mum's house and fell asleep. 

since then i haven't smoked at all. at first it was unintentional... i just felt shit and didn't want to stand outside in the rain. now it's my fourth day without a cigarette and i'm serious about not having another one. i've always thought that one day i'd get a bug that would spur me on to stop smoking and here we are.

the only thing i wished was that i had enjoyed my last one knowing it was my last. 

either way... 4 days... cold turkey... damn, i'm proud of myself! do i want a cigarette? yup! am i going to have one? nope!

edit: thank you to you all for your positive messages... it's really helping me want to stay on track! it's also reminding why i'm doing this because i know when i go back to work someone who smokes will no doubt say something silly like ""oh don't leave me out there on my own!"" and i want to feel strong in my response! thank you :)

edit 2: i've made it well over a month now. feel super proud. cravings have gone and despite going through the stress of buying a house... uve not touched one. i've still got one in my car that i had put there ready to smoke over a month ago that i'm just too lazy to move. but it does remind me every now again that i've done something to be proud of 😊",11
"i'm a registered sex offender because of my father.. hello reddit, this is something that ive never spoken about. i'm only posting about it now because i'm very drunk

all my life i was a homeschool kid. i was an only child and my father taught me everything. my dad was a deeply religious man and insisted on christian homeschooling growing up.

 i wasn't allowed to have friends, and my father was my whole world. my mom died when i was very young, and i never had much memory of her.

 in 2012 i was 15 years old. county police raided our house and took our computer and all of our electronic devices. i later found out that this was for a child pornography sting.

 my dad had been downloading and viewing child pornography. i do want to take the chance to say that he never ever touched me in a sexual way.

 anyway my dad told me that he would go to prison if he was convicted and that i would be alone and never see him again, but he said that if i told the police that i downloaded it i would not get into very much trouble and he would be able to stay at home.

 i told the police that it was me who downloaded it and i was charged and eventually pled guilty to possession of child pornography. i was charged as an adult and now have to register as a sec offender in my state.

 it is very hard living as a sex offender and i consider killing myself every day. i don't hate my dad, but as i've gotten older i realized that he used me. i'm an adult now and i cannot find a job and i don't know what i can do with my future. i still live with my dad and he buys me food and whatever i need, but i want more than that. i just don't know what to do with my life.

**edit:** not charged as an adult. when writing this i meant to say that i was not charged as an adult but still have to register as a sex offender",11
"my parents adopted my siblings and i just so they could rape and molest us.. i've never told anyone this before, ever, in my life, except for the legal authorities after it all came out. i guess this is the perfect place to finally do so, for the anonymity. 

my parents are pedophiles. i'm not entirely sure how they met; us kids got a story growing up, but i don't think it's true, because how big of a coincidence is it that two people with the same awful and taboo fetish hooked up? they were always active as swingers, apparently, so maybe they met in the fetish world. they decided to adopt kids together to sexually abuse, because it wouldn't be as messed up considering we weren't biologically their children. (i'm not saying that. that was their logic.) they adopted my sister and i when i was 2 and she was a baby first, we had the same crack addicted bio mom who lost both of us to the state. when i was 4 and 7 they adopted my two brothers, and when i was 10 they adopted my youngest sister. 

i know all of this because when i was 19 my dad bragged about all of this to the other couple they were swinging with, who i guess seemed like they were pedophiles as well. they weren't, and turned my parents in to the police. they are both in prison for life. 

i don't want to get into the gory details of everything, except that by the time i was ten i had lost my virginity to my dad and had basically done every sex act under the sun. i thought it was completely normal, and what all little girls did with their fathers. i was a daddy's girl through and through. my father molested my sisters as well, and my mother molested my brothers; everything was hetero. looking back we were the stereotypically abused kids in school, way too knowledgeable about sex/sexually forward for our ages, and my brothers both got in trouble for playing with their own poop. my parents were never suspected, however, because of our traumatic beginnings as the kids of drug addicts.  

by the time i was a teenager my dad pretty much lost interest in me because i was too grown up and was instead molesting my youngest sister. i basically had free reign to do whatever i wanted from the time i was 12. i became hugely promiscuous with older boys at school, which ended with me getting pregnant at 15. the father was my first boyfriend who wasn't one of the scummy guys at school, and his family had shown me that my home life was hugely abnormal. i worried that if my baby was a girl it would be molested by my dad (at the time, i didn't know my mom was abusing my brothers as well) and asked if i could move in with my boyfriend's family. i used the story that my parents were angry about my pregnancy and kicking me out. as for my parents, they didn't care much about me at that point and i suppose they guessed correctly that abusing their grandchild would not work as well since it was also attached to this very loving and functional family. they let me go. 

in a way getting pregnant and moving out so young saved me. all of my younger siblings struggle with drug addiction in some shape or form, be it heroin, meth, alcohol, or multiple substances. one of my brothers shows sociopathic tendencies likely due to the abuse. my youngest sister has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. after my parents were arrested, they all went back into the foster care system, which did not help at all. i am 26 today and while i still have a lot of problems with depression and suicidal thoughts i feel like having my son to live for is the only way i have avoided being addicted to drugs. he is 11 now and a great kid. 

the worst thing for me wasn't the abuse, shockingly. i grew up with it and never felt victimized during it, though i would never ever do what my mom did to my son. it was the fact that during their trial it came out that my parents never thought of us as their ""real"" kids. we were just adopted kids that they took in to use as their playthings. all the love they showed us was just for show. i think that is what will haunt me for the rest of my life.

"my husband is in surgery now to have all of his teeth removed. i can't wait for him to see his new smile!. well, he just went back. i'm so hoping this surgery brings him all the relief he deserves. he has been struggling with bad teeth for years due to a calcium deficiency, coupled with acid reflux that also helped to destroy the enamel on his teeth, and it all led to an ongoing bacterial infection that has been decaying his teeth further. his teeth were so bad that he could bite into a strawberry and break a tooth. i can't even comprehend the pain he has been in and over the course of the last 2 months alone, he has lost significant weight due to not being able to eat. 

it has taken years of convincing and searching and we finally found the right surgeon to help him. he will be walking out today with a brand new set of teeth, and as a new man. 

i'm so nervous and i know the recovery will be hard at times, but i cannot even tell you how excited i am for him to be able to finally share his smile with the world. he never laughs in front of people because of his teeth, but to me his laugh is one of the most wonderful things i have ever heard. everyone else will finally be able to enjoy it with me! i can't even explain how happy that makes me...i just love him so much and want him to be able to finally live a normal, healthy life. 

thanks to anyone who read this. i am just feeling so nervous and i thought writing it out would help. i hope everyone has a wonderful day.

update/edit: hubby is home and resting. he isn't feeling too great, but we expected that. thank you to everyone who commented or even read this. i'm honestly so taken aback by all of the well wishes and i'm so glad people are sharing their stories. 

also, seriously you guys, i can't even express how happy we both are with his new smile. it looks so natural and his doctor even made sure to keep some minor imperfections to make sure his dentures don't look fake. they are absolutely perfect. he is even smiling through this new pain. when i saw him in the chair while he was waking up i couldn't stop myself from crying because i am just so overwhelmed with happiness. he looks so amazing, even with his puffed up and swollen chipmunk cheeks (which i find so adorable). i am truly so lucky to be able to look at his face every day, and even more lucky now that i will be able to see his smile more. 

thank you for all the positivity. keep it up. the world needs more of it. 😊

edit 2: i can't even believe the response this has gotten! i am so blown away. i'm trying to respond to everyone. 

thank you very kindly to whoever gifted me gold. i sincerely look forward to paying it forward!

i showed my husband and he can't believe how many people cared to wish him well and couldn't help but smile a little more. thank you guys all so much for putting another smile on his face. 

he is still hurting, but the bleeding has really started to subside and he is so excited for the future.

"i just realized how much my mom loves me.. i was sitting in my room just now, and my mom came in. started talking and i said, ""i'm hungry"". not even asking her to get me anything nor expecting her to, just making conversation. we talk for a few minutes more then she leaves, and a couple minutes later she comes back with a big plate of food for me despite me not even asking her to. i say thanks then after a while i stop to think like...who else would do this? i tell anyone else i know that i'm hungry they're just gonna say, ""what do ya want me to do about it"" ""so?"" ""okay, and?"" or some variant. and you might think, ""oh big deal it's not like she donated a kidney or anything!"" but that's just the thing: i feel like all of my loved ones would donate a kidney for me if they had to. no question. cause i'd do it for them. but i don't think any of them besides my mom would be willing or even think to do such a small gesture like that. i feel like it says a lot. i really don't appreciate her enough.",11

"i'm glad i went downstairs.. this is going to be such a stupid post, and i'm sorry for that.

my mom and i never really had a good relationship. every time we talk to each other for more than 10 minutes, we start arguing about the most stupidest things imaginable. i love her a lot though, and i know that she loves me. anyway, at around 3:50 pm, she called me and said that she had made food. i said okay, hung up and went on with what i was doing. i got this odd feeling that i should really go downstairs. not a troubled feeling just...a need to go downstairs.

i absolutely hate eating. it disgusts me so much. the feeling of being full, the way you have to chew it up until it's a mushy mess and swallow said mush. i don't eat very much and i just would prefer not to. 

i went down at about 4:10 pm. the first thing i saw was her eating by herself. she had left out a plate with two sunny side up eggs, plátanos (idk what they're called in english) and two slices of bread. she was just sitting there...staring at nothing. i decided to sit down next to her, in front of the plate. 

she doesn't cook much anymore. she stopped a few years ago (when i entered 7th grade/middle school) and the only times she cooks/ we cook together is when making ceviche. she also isn't a very good cook but neither am i.

you better believe i finished that food. i'm unbelievably full right now. i got full after the first few bites but, i just loved seeing that look on her face. she was so happy. i could tell she was holding back a smile, and was genuinely surprised that i finished what she had made. when i was done, i washed my plate, finished my juice and went back upstairs.

i really hope our relationship improves. i absolutely love my mom. i need to stop being such a stuck up kid. 

the food was delicious by the way. 

edit: i didn't except to get so much attention on this ahhh!! also thank you for the silver!! i'm not sure how reddit works exactly even though i've been on here for quite a while but it really means a lot to me that someone liked this post so much they gifted me silver!!

also, i'd like to clear up that i actually and always with my mom. 24/7 unless she wants to stay in her room and rest. other than that, she takes me everywhere and i do enjoy it most of the times, but sometimes i'd like to be alone. i'm sorry if anyone got confused while reading!!! i don't leave her  alone like that i swear lol 

edit #2: holy smokes!!!! i keep getting gifted silver awards!! thank you so much to everyone who has given me one so far. knowing that you liked my post so much as to give me a silver award, especially knowing that you took time out of your day to read this, makes me so unbelievably happy and thankful!!!!

"i finally took a shower today and i feel amazing. so for the past couple of weeks i just completely couldn't get the motivation to be alive ig, and so today i was in my bed just staring at my ceiling and i started just questioning myself, and i was so disgusted with myself. so i got up and got into my shower and scrubbed til i was pink from how raw my skin was, and i shaved my legs and my arms and my arm pits. i got out and i didnt go back to bed!!! i got dressed and i made myself breakfast and i ate all of it. i'm so proud of myself today, because i feel powerful like i can do anything now",11

"my (33 f) best friend (30 m) is getting married today. i just want to say congratulations to my friend for finally getting out of the friendzone. he has been pining for ""the girl next door"" since he was 19, supporting her from afar and letting her know he'd always be there for her. nearly twelve years later, she finally saw him for what he really is - the perfect man for her - and they're eloping today and i couldn't be happier. 

i love you, chris. i'm so grateful you were patient with me and kept loving me despite my issues. i'm looking forward to this life with you. 

i'm so glad you're my one. 

i'm glad it's you. ",11
"to the high school lunch ladies who probably saw me. stealing chicken sandwiches in the lunch line  (because i didn't want to ask my single mom for money ...knowing there was none to give...) 
thanks for not saying anything.

edit: (idk if i'm doing the edit thing right) but whoa this blew up more than i thought it would. to confirm, i am a woman born in the 80s and was just reflecting.  now, i didn't have to steal those delicious sandwiches all the time, but enough to feel a little bad about it today.  thanks to everyone for sharing their story.",11
"i reached 50 consecutive pushups for the first time ever today.. last year i wanted to reach 50. i started at 27. i injured myself at 42, and quit. since january, i've been working out three days a week, but i never do pushups. i decided to do it for fun today and got to exactly 50. downvote me all you want, i'm proud.",11
"my son used this account to write his last words before he took his own life.. i was advised to post this here, as it was removed from another page. i apologize if this is also the wrong place for this.

my son, who would have been 21 this month, hanged himself on december 24 2016. christmas eve. my baby boy. gone. there are no words to describe what it did to me, and what it did to the family. i went into his room midday expecting to find him still in bed. i found him hanging in the closet. two lives were destroyed that day. the neighbors called the police when they heard my screams. i could not leave my house for months and lost my job. my older children had to move back in to support me because i refused to go out or clean the house or even eat food. my life had lost all purpose and for a while it was over. with time and extensive therapy i am just barely functional again, but life has never felt so empty. not a moment goes by that i don't think of him. i spend countless hours every day thinking of how i could have changed it. i know i could have. 

my son was enrolled in a general health studies program at the local university. he didn't have an interest in health and didn't know what career he wanted to pursue, but i pushed him into it thinking it had the most potential for a successful career path and that he could develop an interest over time. he didn't do very well in his first year but he made it through with a few failed courses. in april 2016 he had finished the winter term of his second year. i asked him about his final grades. he kept telling me that he hadn't received them yet. i knew he had but i didn't push. the summer term was starting and we had agreed that he would take summer courses for the courses he had failed in first year. he told me that he had applied to them, and he also told me he had finally received his second term grades and that he had passed them all. i didn't know at the time that neither of those were true. it was all online so i never checked. if i did, i would have known that he had failed all five of his winter courses because he had stopped showing up to classes due to depression and he never applied to any summer courses. i found this out later in august when he broke down and admitted it all. i did not take it well. i was so upset that he had failed his program, that he lied to me so many times, and that he spent the entire summer pretending to go to class while doing other things. i called the school immediately and arranged an appointment with the faculty. i explained the situation to them and they agreed to let him reapply in the fall as a special student, and that if he did well in his remedial classes he would have a chance to continue his program where he left off. he didn't want to do it. he wanted to take a break from school and apply to a different program later. i refused. i forced him to go back. i knew he hated it and i made him do it anyway. i didn't do anything to treat his depression despite knowing about it. instead i used it as an excuse to get him back in the program he never wanted to be in. i made him feel trapped enough to take his own life and i can never forgive myself for that. 

going back into his room was the hardest thing i've ever had to do. one step inside and i had a breakdown. months passed. i tried again. breakdown. we had to keep it locked until we hired a cleaner to pack his things because i could not bare to look at anything that belonged to him. i was only able to enter once the room was completely empty with just a few boxes stacked in the corner. months later when i was home alone, i mustered the strength to open one of the boxes. sitting on top was his laptop. i opened it and found it unlocked. i told myself i shouldn't look through it. it would only ruin me again. but i had to. i had to know. maybe he saw something that made him want to do it. maybe he had messaged one of his friends, and maybe they said something to him. i just wanted to understand why. why he would feel so hopeless that he had to take his own life. i found mostly things that would be normal to find in a young person's browsing history. people's facebook profiles, assorted youtube videos, a whole world i never knew. there was a file folder compiling images from what i could tell was shows/comics/games that he liked. i've never seen any of it before. i never cared. another folder with images of my son with his friends from his high school. i didn't recognize any of them. i never bothered to ask. i found a video in his youtube history showcasing how to tie a noose. i had to stop there and weep until i had a migraine. then i went back. i found entries on kijiji. he was trying to sell his game consoles and games, which i later found out he spent his tuition to buy. i found a site called liveleak, where there were a lot of entries on videos of people dying on camera. i believe he was trying to prepare himself for what he was going to do to himself. then i found this site, reddit, and i noticed his account still logged in. this one. nothing could have prepared me for what i was about to find. months of grief counseling undone in an instant. i had the worst breakdown of my life. reading through everything he wrote in his last days tore my already scarred heart into a million shreds. he had reached out for help so many times. he felt so alone. he wrote that if he died i would only care about the money i wasted raising him. i thought i had felt the worst pain a person could feel until i read that. it was my fault. he felt so alone and hopeless in his last days. and i made him feel that way. i knew he wasn't happy but i made him go back. i killed him.

if only i could tell him now that it doesn't matter to me. that no school or degree was worth his life. that no matter what he did, i would love him no matter what. oh how i miss my sweet boy. my baby is gone and i will never be okay again.",11
"my dad died last week and it was perfect. my father died last week.  he was 54 years old and the healthiest he had been in decades.  to say this was unexpected is an understatement of insane proportions.  my parents were 3 to 5 years away from retirement and had been making plans to travel.  i had also been about to quit my job, sell my car and move to a different state in hopes of finding out what i want to do with my life.  now everything has just stopped.  all plans have been blown up.  everything is so uncertain and scary.  the only peace i have found, has oddly been in the way my father died.  
my parents were snorkeling on the last day of their two week hawaiian vacation.  snorkeling is my fathers favorite thing to do anywhere it is warm enough.  he will stay in he water for hours.  he loves to dive really deep, touch the bottom, come back up, and then dare us to do the same.  he is always so proud of everyone's accomplishments (his included) no matter how small they may seem.  on this particular day, my parents were snorkeling in a popular spot in oahu.  they had been in the water for over an hour and decided to head back to shore.  my dad began to feel tired, so they stopped to float on their backs while my dad caught his breath.   after a few minutes, he told my mom that he didn't think he would be able to make it back to shore.  he is a great swimmer, but a big guy, and my mom wouldn't be able to get him back to shore on her own so she asked nearby swimmers for their help in pulling him back to shore.  by the time they made it to the shore, he was already dead.
my father had a massive heart attack and died in minutes.  he had no pain.  my father passed away, floating on his back in the warm waters of hawaii, staring at the blue sky.  the last image he had in his head was beautiful, his last smell was the ocean, his last thoughts were peaceful and the last voice he heard was my mother.
is there a better way to go?

"july 16th, 2017 was the death date i decided for myself.. i went down a dark path for myself in 2016-17. nights of being drunk or high on oxycontin. gliding a knife gently on my wrist and then gently adding pressure until i saw myself bleed. 

i knew i was depressed. secretly, i've always been depressed but it really took control of me that year. 

i don't ever support drunk driving, but i must admit, i did it a lot. i hoped that i'd flip my car. but i never did. 

i didn't tell anyone of my constant thoughts of suicide or self harm. i didn't want anyone to know. i didn't want people to think i was just wanting attention. i didn't want people to think i was ""weird"" or being dramatic. i kept it to myself which is one of the most dangerous things someone can do when they have depression. 

the little voice in your head gets louder, more aggressive, mean, vile and evil. telling you, you're not good enough. telling you to just end it all. telling you no one loves you. telling you you're a waste of life. 

it's hard not to listen when the voice is constantly in your head. it dictates everything. i wondered to myself if i was ""crazy"".

i couldn't bare with myself. i cried all the time, alone. 

july 15th, 2017, i bought more than enough drugs to end my life. i was determined and ready for it. i wanted everything to stop. i wanted peace. 

i decided, for my last day on earth, i was going to do the one thing i loved and resorted to a lot. video games. 

i joined a random lobby. i usually didn't talk to others online, just throw music on and listen to that as i played. mute the other players. 

 but before i could mute the players, a woman in the lobby tried talking to me. she tried to include me in the conversation she and her friends were having. something told me to respond and join in the conversation. which i've never done before or cared to do. 

she was funny, she made me laugh. she included me into every conversation she and her friends shared. we joked, we laughed. for once in a long time, i didn't feel like ending my life or causing harm to myself. she told me to add her, and so i did. 

almost 2 years later, she's the love of my life. i'm hers and she's mine. she has no problem flaunting that. 

she has 2 kids from a previous relationship. she loves me and they love me. they call me dad, because their real dad is a shitty person. 

she helped me with my drug and alcohol abuse. she drove me back and forth from a drug rehabilitation centre for my opioid abuse. she waited in the centre for me while i got my daily dose of methadone to treat my oxycontin abuse. 

once the doctors at the centre trusted me enough to give me my own prescription of methadone so i didn't have to travel so far every day, she helped remind me to take it. 

she also encouraged me to see counselling and to go on antidepressants. i did, though it was a painful journey to find what antidepressant worked best for me, i did it. i feel happier and never have a thought about killing or harming myself. 

she gave me a family. she gave me love. she gave me happiness and no matter how difficult or stubborn. i was, she never gave up on me. 

she held me through my dark moments and eased the bad thoughts away with her words and touch. i can honestly say i've never felt that before. simply to put it, 

she saved my life. 

we've cried together, laughed together, been angry at each other among other things but we always ended the day with saying ""i love you"" to each other. 

just tonight, she dealt with my drunk ass and made sure i was safe. 

right now, i'm writing this while laying beside her as she sleeps. i love her. 

in the new few months i plan to propose to her and her kids. i will be the best step dad, husband and best friend to her. her and her kids are my everything. we have plans to expand our family too. 

she came into my life just at the right time. i'm grateful. i'm also lucky that we ended up living very close to each other. she has supported me through my rough times and i've supported her. 

i was never the one to believe in love but now that i'm in the place that i'm in, i do believe in it. it just takes time. 

thank you for reading. :)

edit: i just want to thank all of you people for reading my story. thank you for commenting and sharing your experiences with me. my intent while writing this post was to shine hope to people who are going through similar experiences. thank you for the slivers, gold and platinum. i encourage anyone to share this with a loved one, friends, lovers etc. a lot people hide in the dark with their depression and are scared to come forth with it and it shouldn't be that way. please speak up. <3",11
"i'm sad i found this in my little sisters bag.... when i was younger, we where a poor family. so free school lunch was kinda of a luxury too us. we even brought home when we could. but i am older now, and things are better off.

i was in my car, and needed a paper and pencil, my baby sisters bag, and i had noticed that her bag was heavy. when looked inside, there where cartons of school chocolate milk, muffins, and grilled cheese sandwiches. see, growing up, my family saw those as unneeded, and never bought them.

it broke my heart to see my younger sister going through the same thing. picking up what people are leaving behind. and honestly, today, it crushed my soul that she thinks in that matter. it's 3 am, but tomorrow, i am going grocery shopping, picking up chocolate milk gallons, muffins, snacks, pigging out basically. i do not ever want her to ever feel the need to pick up peoples left overs. or ever ask someone for a treat. i always begged the kids around me for snacks when it came to snack time, cause, well, my parents never packed me one. it hurts, it fucking hurts. i'm ending the cycle here and now.

edit: i cannot thank you all for what you are saying. there are beautiful stories of humans down below. we, us, me and you, are beautiful. we want to love and give love.

also something i should mention, me and my family immigrated from a 3rd world country. it is embedded in my parents logic, anything that is bare needed to survive is luxury. despite now we are so much financially better, they still hold it true. and it hurts to see that my sister still believes that we are poor, despite well, not being be. 

thank you again for all the love",11
"my mom had a stroke tonight, please pray for her. 🙏❤. i'm worried about my mom because tonight she came into my room crying because she couldn't speak. 😢 i thought maybe someone had died because she was crying too and wouldn't say anything, i was really scared. me and my family are worried about her. right now she's in the hospital getting some tests done. all we know so far is that she sneezed and was in alot of pain, and then she lost her ability to speak. i love her so much, and i feel bad because this morning me and my mom were arguing, and now that she can't talk i feel horrible. my mom has had a stroke and a heart attack before many years ago. she was also in a bad car accident which gave her chronic neck problems and a lot of pain. she also can't write now either, so i'm almost certain she had a stroke. please pray that she will be able to speak and write again soon without any difficulty. i love her so much, and feel awful for all of the mean things i've ever said or done to her. 😭 ... i just want to see her be healthy and happy. please pray for her. 🙏🙏🙏 thank you. 😇 ❤❤❤",11
"went to visit my grandma one day, went into wrong room, been visiting elderly lady ever since.. 



edit : unfortunately it isn't a good one, my friend passed away two days ago guys and i'm trying to think of a way to explain to my 3 year old that we won't see her again, she just lost her cat a week ago and was devastated and keeps asking if she is coming back tomorrow, so i'm struggling but when i do tell her i'm going to just be honest. 
i have the amazing memories with my accidental friend which will be forever in my heart because she has taught me so much without even knowing it.
her family live far away and have asked me to start sorting through her things and given me permission to see her at the funeral home and start making arrangements, i think they kind of wrote her off when she had gotten sick which is sad. i'm going to do my  best for her. i know her favourite songs, her favourite outfit and the lipstick she always wore, so i'm going to sort all of that over the next few days.
i feel extremely sad but also grateful i got to experience this kind of unexpected bond and feel as though we were placed together for whatever reasons to help us both.
i'm sad my kid probably won't remember, but we have dozens of pictures to look at.
thanks again everyone for being so kind, i'm just sorry it's such a sad update.

so this is probably the wrong place to post this but i'm new to posting, here's what took place..

this was 11 months ago. my husbands grandma (i call her grandma because we're extremely close and she's one of the best people i know) lives in an assisted living place, the rooms have the same layout in each one and same decor unless the occupant has changed it. my grandma had been there about two months by this time and i had been to see her each week but she had been in hospital for the past few weeks and was having her room decorated whilst she was there. 
me and my daughter also have the same routine, we go in using my door fob, we wait for the lift and she's presses the button to my grandmas floor. this day i was on a call to work and wasn't paying enough attention, so we get out of the lift and the decor in the hallway is different, it's been painted pink and me and my kid are like wow it looks so good here, we trot along down the hall to my grandmas room and knock, a lady answers and we say hi and go in, i thought it must be my grandmas friend (she has a lot) so we take our shoes off and go into the living area.
this is when i realise that shit! we're in the wrong room. what happened is my kid had pressed floor 2 in the lift rather than 1. it hadnt been decorated, but had always been that way, i just hadn't visited that floor before. 
i was just about to explain my mistake when the lady ushers us to sit down and says how great it is us to see us as it had been so long and she had been lonely. my kid has started playing with her fridge magnets by this time so when she asked if i wanted a cup of tea i agreed. we chatted about a lot, and i ended up staying for 40 minutes and helping her set some things to record. she loved us being there and adored my kid so i didn't want to break her heart and tell her we had never actually met. we hugged as we left and i went down to speak to the staff and let them know what had happened, in case the lady told them or her family she'd had visitors and gotten confused.
they proceeded to tell me that she doesn't get many visitors, her family live the other side of the country, she's widowed, has dementia and the only person who regularly visits is her husbands brother. turns out she was a hospital matron until she was 61. she is now 82.
to this day, i still visit the friend i made accidentally that day. her and my grandma fast became friends afterwards, and we all eat lunch together once a week. she provides me with wisdom, lots of laughs and hugs and a lot of cake. i fix things for her. help with whatever she needs doing in her place and accompany her to doctors appointments.
my daughter adores her, and we take her to get her hair set every few weeks. she spends family time with us, we cook, we watch antiques roadshow and she's teaching me to knit. 
she does believe i am family, and i'm ok with that because she feels like family to me. 

i'm so glad i was being a shitty parent that day and my kid pressed the wrong button.

edit; thank you so much for all of the replies, and whoever gave me gold/silver. i didn't expect it.
for all the people saying they wish they could befriend an elder, i say go for it! yes, i have provided my friend with company and happiness but honestly she's given me so much too, she's unbelievably wise and she listens intently. you don't find that with many people anymore! she cares deeply about me and my kid. i honestly believe that some things are supposed to happen to lead us in a certain direction and this day is one of those times! it's her birthday this weekend so we are going to the restaurant where her husband used to take her.
really appreciate all the love, thank you!!! 

edit 2; just wanted to again say thank you to all of you. makes me so happy people are so kind. thank you for all the love/ responses",11
"please, just read.. i've been in a really bad place for a while now and seeing the positivity on here makes me the slightest bit more happy. it's as if people can *see* me, even though there are so many users behind screens. just wanted to **get that off my chest**",11
"i stopped and picked up a man and his pregnant wife on a rainy night in seattle in 1977. i just figured out that i may be able to find out how this story ended after all these years. i was southbound on i5 on a week night in the early autumn of 1977. rain was pouring down and the interstate was awash. i was driving an orange, 1973 bmw tii when i saw a crazy man in the middle of i5 jumping up and down and waving his arms. i slowed down and stopped about 300 yards away from his stalled car. he ran up to my window and shouted ""my wife and i were going to the hospital, she is in labor and i ran out of gas can you take us the rest of the way!!!?"" he jumped in the back seat and i backed up along i5 in the dark, in the rain about 300 yards. i got out and helped his wife into the car. boy was she pissed! she was so pregnant that she could no longer bend at the waist. she put down her pillow and slowly got in. the guy sat in the back and fucking yammered the whole way to the hospital. we got to the hospital and the women of the family closed around her and, in the arms and the care of other women, she vanished into the sliding doors of the hospital.
i was left alone and forgotten under the porte-cochère with the rain still falling in sheets.
so if you were born on a rainy week night in the early fall of 1977 in seattle and your idiot father ran out of gas on i5 taking your mom to the hospital i am the dashing stranger who got you the last few miles into the care of your family. you are 38 now and i am nearly 70. i have wondered about you a lot over the years. i almost feel like you are, in a small way, one of my own. i would love to know how this story ended.",11
"i'm getting married and i hate it.. hate might be a big word, but let's say i'm not looking forward to it. previously i had no direction or solid plans in my life, didn't think i needed it at my age anyways (22). i have a job i somewhat enjoy. the woman i'm getting married to is super excited and can't be happier. and she's pregnant. we started off as fwb august last year. she's extremely attractive and the sex is something else, never experienced anything like it. in november she made it clear that she wanted a relationship with me. total breakdown and lots of tears. i didn't. i like her, but we lack common interests besides watching netflix. despite this we stayed fwb, stupid mistake i know. looking back it only gave her hope. we usually used condoms. sometimes when we were drunk or super horny we ditched them, as she said she was on the pill.

skip to march this year and wooooo, she's pregnant! she cried tears of happiness in my arms. i had no reaction. i asked her if she was sure if i was the father, though we were exclusive. she was heartbroken and i felt bad, but in the end she agreed to a prenatal dna test. that shit is super expensive too and the waiting killed me. aaand i'm the father. we cried in each other's arms but honestly that was because i didn't know how to handle my emotions. she suggested we moved in together and become official, abortion was not an option anyways. i agreed and she was (still is) over the moon. we signed a lease in may. she expressed she had always wanted to get married before having a kid and at this point i didn't care anymore and i proposed. wedding is in september. everyone is super excited and happy for us. so many comments about how they we were going to end up together and that we're a great fit. she's planning the wedding together with my mom who is thrilled too. i'm feeling indifferent about it. i think i love her but she's not my soulmate. looks wise she's by far the prettiest girl i've been with. i think it's one of the reasons why nobody thinks it's weird we're getting married so fast.

the catch is that she has never been on the pill in her life. she confessed it after she got pregnant because she couldn't keep it to herself anymore and felt guilty. she's also what i like to call high functioning crazy. not batshit insane but definitely a little bit crazy. nothing i can't put up with however. she tells me she loves me every day and well, is crazy about me basically. would do anything for me, and locked me to her forever with our kid. i grew up without a dad and it was horrible, not like my mom didn't try but it had a big impact on me. i don't want to leave my kid or only see him every other weekend, and i'm sure she would do anything to ruin my life if i left her right now. would still have to pay child support anyways. i've accepted my life as it is right now and i'll try to make the best of it. sexually speaking i'm more than satisfied, still daily and i do love it. emotionally i don't feel as much as a connection. an ex reached out to me and we started talking, but my fiance found out. she forgave me and once again told me she would never leave me and do anything to fix us. i regret talking to her, though we didn't even discuss anything inappropriate or emotionally cheated.

hah, sorry for the wall of text. can't talk about this shit with anyone in my life and it's been in my head for weeks.",11
"if you threaten to kill yourself/others, or harm yourself/others to keep someone in a relationship with you, you're a piece of shit.. the title says it all.

i absolutely cannot stand people who threaten to kill themselves or harm themselves or others to keep people in a relationship with them. it stresses the person out as they don't wanna be with you but are scared because they don't wanna be responsible for your death. fuck you.

also i can't stand emotionally draining friendships. i get it. it's okay to be sad or angry or depressed. hell yeah im gonna help you out but for fuck sake don't make every conversation about how you're depressed or upset or angry. let's have a lighter conversation about something we like. shit doesn't even have to be something **i** like but let's have a happy conversation once in awhile. it gets to the point where people don't wanna continue to talk to you when all you are is depressed.

i'm not trying to be mean or insensitive here. i know depression isn't something you can just get rid of. i know that. but one way to help work through it is to try and think more of the happy little things around you. 

i'm sorry if this is all jumbled, i'm just really needing this off my chest right now.

**edit:** holy shit this blew up. thank you so much reddit for showing me i'm not the only one who's been through this.

also to clarify, i'd never cut contact with someone because they were truly depressed and self harming. i would stay and help them out unless it did turn into an abusive move on their part. i have no problem helping people out and making them happy. just don't abuse that part of me.

**edit** **2:** for those of you truly going through depression, get help. there are plenty of online therapists and hotlines to call to help you out. just please please please never let it turn you into a monster where you hurt others and bring them down with you. please get help. it will get better.

**edit** **3:** thank you guys for all the support and all the stories of your guys' experiences with this. for those of you going through this type of relationship, get out as soon as possible. don't stick around with these abusive fucksticks who threaten you and manipulate you. also please know the difference between ""my depressions really getting to me, i'm having suicidal thoughts"" and ""if you leave me i'm going to kill myself and it's your fault""",11
"i triggered my wife's ptsd and she pulled a knife on me.. i feel like a monster for causing this. my wife and i are newly married and very young. she spent 3 years of her life living with with a physically, sexually, and emotionally abusive boyfriend named alex who made her life hell, and it has really affected her life in many negative ways. she is not on any kinds of medication although she probably should be, but i have always been very cautious of her ptsd and do my best to not trigger any of it. i honestly feel like i failed last night as a husband. we were laying on the couch watching tv and somehow this escalated to us play fighting (we like to wrestle a lot so this wasn't new). all of a sudden we were standing up and i grabbed her arms and pinned her against the wall with what i now see as a little too much force. i don't think i'll ever be able to get rid of the picture of the change in her eyes. she went from laughing and having fun to absolute and utter fear. her breath got short and her skin went pale, her eyes widened and before i could say anything they started welling up with tears. i let go and she ran out of the room. i decided to follow because i had no idea what was going on in that instant. she ran into the kitchen and i followed, when all of a sudden she grabbed a knife from the drawer and yelled, ""get away from me alex! (her exes name)"" because of instruction she had given me months before in case of an episode, i knew i had to stop this the way she told me to, so i ran to her before she could do anything and pulled the knife away and hugged her, immobilizing her so she wouldn't do anything to hurt herself or me. after a few seconds of struggling, we fell to the ground, she hyperventilated, and sobbed in my arms. a few hours later she was back to normal.

my main point for posting here is because i need to get off my chest the fact that i had done something that reminded her of her terrible ex. it makes me feel disgusting. as her husband i'm supposed to protect her and i feel like i failed at this. although it's nice to share the experience, i can't help but tear up thinking about it. i used to be a person who didn't give much thought to people with ptsd. most of the time i thought it was just an act or a way to get attention, and i would say it wasn't real unless you got it in war or a car crash or something. i'm grateful i'm an advocate and a friend to those who suffer with ptsd. and as a friend i would also like some advice on how to help my wife and how to avoid triggering her again. thank you for listening, and any support would he greatly appreciated.

update: the support we are receiving from this community is incredible. y'all have reduced a grown man to tears seeing how many people love and care for us. we will take each of yalls suggestions into consideration and will update when we decide what is best for us. y'all are amazing and have a special place in my heart. thank you.

edit: for those helping me understand that going at her when she had the knife is a terrible idea, i understand i shouldn't have. thank you and if it happens again i'll take a more subtle approach. 

edit: for those who are criticizing how i handled the situation in whole, you are not my spouse and do not know who my wife is. she has asked me to take control physically because it helps her to calm down. it is what she asked me to do and what i will continue to do because she needs me to.

"please do not get childrens, if you do not want them.. as a father of three childrens, i really know how taxing it is, to have this little angels. i did not had any 8 hours sleep without any disturbance since 4 and a half year. i haven't sleep beside my wife for at least a month now. but when i sleep beside my daughter and see her beautiful face, i know, it is worth it.

but as a father i came into contact with a lot of other parents and i do not understand, why they choose to have childrens. and i do not mean accidents.

why did you wanted a child, when the first thing you do, is to leave your wife and your four month little boy and go on a spontaneous vacations with your brother for two weeks?

we have in germany parental leave. it means you get a paid year, to raise your child and you can not be fired from your job. you are a doctor. i really think you know, how to prevent getting childrens. so why are you telling my, your time-out year was the worst year of your life? why did you get a second child?

and so on.

you are not obligated to have childrens. but if you want some, you are obligated to care for them.

sry, am laying awake beside my daughter and got a whatsapp picture from the guy, who left his wife at home. 

and if you thing, it is envy, let me tell you, i am at the beginning of my parental leave year and i am really excited about this year with my childrens.

edit: thx for the gold kind stranger and sorry for the ""childrens""

edit2: and also thx for all the comments and kind words. sry, with three active children, i have no time reading and answering all of them. i do not want to be a farther, who spends all his time on the phone instead of playing with his children",11

"fiance is cheating on me and i am heartbroken update. i posted yesterday and got so much great support -- thank you all for that! i think, however, my post (and a followup) were deleted for some reason. i thought i'd try again with a different handle. here's what i wrote yesterday, and then the followup below. thank you all again for the support and understanding!

*****

(original post)

i found out last weekend that my fiance is almost definitely cheating on me (99% sure) and i have never felt like this. completely brokenhearted and disillusioned.

long story short: she told me she was going to a concert with her friend -- her friend had scored an extra ticket and asked her. i was happy for her, told her go ahead, have fun.

i got a text from a friend later on that night with a ""bro, isn't that xxx?"" message. a friend at the same concert saw my fiance and her female friend with two men. in the pictures (he sent three) the guy has his arms around my fiance in the middle of the crowd, and in one they are kissing. not a friend kiss, either. liplock, totally into it.

i almost threw up when i saw them. definitely her -- same outfit, etc. and one was a pretty clear closeup of her profile, and i also recognized her friend. i don't know the guy.

i was so broken and ill, i didn't know what to do. i left the apartment and just started walking. i then texted a friend and asked if i could come by. he said sure. as soon as he saw me he knew something was really wrong and sat me down and i spilled it. i cried, the whole works. he was the best, took care of me, got me drunk and high and we sat around all night just talking and drinking. i ended up crashing at his place.

i wake up (it's a sunday, i feel like shit, it's already after 10) and i've got a dozen texts from her -- where am i? why am i not answering? am i in the hospital? she's going nuts (she says).

i just texted her the pic of her kissing the guy, no comment. then she starts calling and texting nonstop so i just turned the phone off.

i haven't been back to our apartment, haven't talked to her. i blocked her cellphone. i can't even see her. i'm afraid of breaking down in front of her and i don't want to do that. we were supposed to get married in april, we were knee-deep in planning. she seemed so happy and excited about our future. now it's all gone.

a few friends know and are behind me. heard through them she is doing everything she can to contact me. she showed up at my work monday morning but i refused permission for her to come up. i also leave by the alley entrance because a colleague texted me yesterday she was sitting in her car outside work. i know eventually i'll have to talk to her, if only to get my shit out of the apartment and cancel the lease and all that. but fuck ... i am broken.

thanks for letting me vent here.

 *****

then i posted a separate update:

first, thank you so much to all who gave support, advice, well-wishing, all of it. (and also reddit gold.) i was and am overwhelmed not only by all the kind words but also by the number of people who have had similar experiences. i wish i could reply to all of you so i hope this is good enough. thank you!

my brother flew in yesterday and got an airbnb through tuesday so i am now staying with him. he is awesome and i am lucky to have him here. as many of you have pointed out i am lucky to have him (and my other awesome family) as well as a great circle of friends. they have been amazing. you do find out who you can count on when shit like this happens.

so, i talked to my ex last night (and yes, she is an ex) after having a long talk with my brother about it. he was there but gave me some privacy. it was awful, as you can imagine, and worse than i even expected, and i was bracing for it to be bad. as soon as she answered she started crying so of course i started crying and it sucked because i really didn't want to cry either on the phone or in front of her. when we could finally talk she just started apologizing and crying and begging me to come back ""home.""

i'll spare you all that was said because frankly it even hurts to write this down. but long story short, when i could get under some control, i asked her who the guy is, what had been happening and basically said you need to tell me all of it, right now. so she told me her friend (who she went to the concert with) and her boyfriend (who the friend was at the concert with) had introduced them when they were all out in june for drinks and dinner (i was visiting family.) she said it wasn't a setup or anything, the guy just happened to be there at the same time. she said he got her number from the friend and started texting her. she said she ignored him but then answered and they started texting. she kept saying she didn't know why she did it. i fucking hate to even write this. she met him for drinks and they went to his place and had sex. she said they've had sex maybe half a dozen times, all at his place, after i basically forced her to tell me, but not sure i believe that for reasons i don't even want to get into. she was crying this whole time and i could barely understand her but she kept apologizing and saying she loved me and was sorry. i was literally trying not to puke. i told her i had to hang up and then basically sat there feeling like someone had literally kicked me in the guts. couldn't breathe, all that. worst feeling ever.

i went and took a walk alone and just zoned out for a bit and then went back and sat with my brother for a bit and we talked and frankly he just sat there hugging me hard. i don't know what i would have done without him there.

so yeah. i sent her an email late last night. telling her i'd be there saturday with my brother and best friend to get my stuff. told her not to be there. told her i had already talked to leasing company. they are letting me out of the lease at the end of october, so told her she can stay there til then (rent is already paid and i will get deposit back too, which is awesome). told her to deal with any wedding stuff. we have a deposit in on a reception venue that we'll probably lose, i don't give a fuck. i told her i don't want a single thing of ours together, she can keep all that shit. i told her i don't want to talk to her or see her anymore. she replied this morning but i haven't read it yet, don't really plan to today.

so that's where things are. again, thank you to all of you who have been so supportive. it really means a lot to me.",11
"i've smoked my last cigarette, hit my last bong(for now), i've booked my appointment for therapy, i'm going to start my gym journey(via personal trainer) and i'm going to try get out more.. i'm nervous and honestly, i'm terrified i'll fail. 
i'm terrified i won't be able to do these things and i'll just end up as isolated loner who is in constant pain. this is a route i'm sure to go down if i continue being like this so i want to change. 

here's hoping i'm successful in doing so. 
i don't have a single friend online or in real life so i'll have to keep a clear head a remind myself why i'm doing it: 'so i don't become the isolated loner who dies alone without ever having a happy life'

edit: i just want to say thank you for the support. last week, i was trying to figure out ways to off myself, this week i'm setting goals that are hard but beneficial. 
a lot of people much stronger than i, have commented such wonderful things and i feel less lonely and worthless because of it. 
at first all i wanted was to be as happy as people i see on the street, 
but now i just want *everyone* who is in the same boat as me to be happy. 

if anyone has decided to take up the same goals as me...
well i just hope that one year from now, 
this post won't matter, and it won't have to be something to look for because we will have already accomplished what we needed.",11
"you should not have to feel guilty calling in sick for work to look after your mental health. you should not have to feel guilty for wanting to take time off work for looking after your mental health. it happens to more pelple than yoy expect but it does you no favours in the long run (trust me i know) 

i had to call in sick to work because this is the worst i have felt in a while. it's got to the point now where when i'm going out enjoying myself to try and take my mind off of this horrible burden i have on myself i end up breaking down and bursting into tears because when i try and enjoy myself i can feel the horrible feeling of dread looming over me and growing. 

due to this i had to take a day off, there is no way i could even think about getting out of bed, let alone go to work and pretend to be happy for 10 hours on a night shift. but then i hear that my boss is kicking off and being nasty behind my back over the fact that they are understaffed. it makes you feel so fucking guilty that you're just trying to look after yourself. then it gets heavier and heavier to do anything as you feel as if you're letting people down, you could potentially work yourself into the ground... literally. we have literally forgot how to lool after ourselves because a select few are more focused on themselves. and now i am in this state of i really cannot go into work because of how crippling it is, but i don't want to let anyone down or be singled out as the person thag don't work (this is the only ""day off"" i've had) 

what's the worst is that no one seems to be taking it seriously at all, like i'm doing it for attention because ""what have i got to be depressed about?"" is the recurring mentality for certain individuals. it's not my fucking fault that they should employ more people. 

i don't know what to do. i want to escape it. i never thought i would get like this because i've always been so positive and alive. but really i'm not exaggerating this has been the worst year for me, and i don't know how much more i can take of being like this and having the added thought of letting people down when i just want to look after myself. 

i never share stuff like this socially because i'm not askiny for sympathy, i just want to vent how i feel and maybe even help someone else. all i've done my entire life is help and support people... so much so i forgot about myself. and now i feel like i have no one.",11
"i've lost 33lbs, no ones noticed and i can't talk about it. i'm 16, 5'3. went from 155 to 122. i have always been overweight and never learned portion control. i was tired of it so i started working out everyday in my room and eating healthy things. i gave up soda (haven't had a sip since new years) and frozen meals etc.

i can't tell anyone because my family is anti-diet and thinks a child making healthy choices will automatically kill them. tried to drink water once. accused of ""tryna get that anorexia, your genetics can't be changed you're just overweight deal with it"" okay, juice it is, better than soda.

it sucked when i didnt want to eat something that serves 20 people by myself and i immediately get accused of  ""tryna get that anorexia"", then seconds later would get called out for being overweight and accused of sneaking cookies or whatever. (didn't snack, just bad portion control forced on me)

anyway, through good decisions i managed to obtain a healthy lifestyle and go from bmi 127 to 121. overweight to normal weight. all since new years (cliche i know).

i have a little ways to go before i'm at my medical ideal weight and i'm real proud tbh. lost inches off the waist and my old clothes fit me. but it feels like everyone still sees me as overweight. i get treated like it. no comments on me looking thinner.

it's for the best no one notices, because i'd so be seriously accused of having an eating disorder. but it still kinda invalidates my progress. whatever. it's not about what people think, it's about not getting diabetes and having to be lifted out of bed with a bulldozer scoop. healthy gang rise up.",11
"i am not proud of my son.. this saturday, my son will have been sober for 18 months.  he got his ged this year, and he starts at community college at the end of august.  he finally has a job that i didn't get for him, soon he will be moving into his own apartment, and he hasn't missed a single appointment with his therapist.  he has done everything you would expect of a precocious 17-year-old who hit a rough patch after meeting with a particularly bad influence.

 he is 29.

this is the point where i'm supposed to say that, nevertheless, i'm *still* proud of him for turning his life around, getting off drugs and off the streets, staying out of trouble, and acting like a responsible adult, or at least an adult who knows the meaning of ""responsible."" maybe i'll throw in a reference to the prodigal son and kill a fatted calf for him. that's certainly what's expected of me.  that's certainly what my *son* expects of me.  he ~~wants~~ demands praise and forgiveness and a party and me to hug him and tell him it's all right.  demands me to tell him how proud i am that he's made something of himself.

but i'm not, because he hasn't.  not in the slightest.

his mother and i gave him every opportunity we could.  i don't expect any praise for that, because unlike my son, i don't expect praise for *doing what you're supposed to*.  she and i worked hard to give him a loving, stable, comfortable, supportive home.  we were involved in his school, we introduced him to music (to the extent that any two people can; his mother was a damn good cellist, though) and sports and culture, we fed him healthy meals, we played with him--thanks to him, we got in the best shape we'd ever been in since our 20s--and we let him stumble and fall and make mistakes and *get back up again*.   

he started shoplifting at 15.  the first time we caught him, we bodily dragged him back to the store, made him return the copy of grand theft auto and apologize, and offered to pay for any damages.  the second time we caught him (this time with a pair of shoes), we did the same thing.  the third time, we started going to family therapy.  

therapy seemed to go well, and after a few sessions the therapist asked for a few one-on-one meetings with him.  after two of those, the police came knocking on our door, because the little shit had concocted some story about how we were a religious cult who raped him for breakfast every saturday ... and the dumb chickenshit therapist actually believed him.  rational heads prevailed, we fired that therapist, and he went through six more in as many months, until eventually we couldn't find anyone who would take him as a patient.

by 16, he was drinking.  then we found pot in his bedroom, and in *our* bedroom.  he started leaving needles, bongs, and crack pipes where he knew we'd eventually find them, just to fuck with us.  i know this because he said so, in those exact words.  he had his first intervention and first trip to rehab that year, and his first relapse.

he had to repeat a year of high school at 17, which meant he was now the ringleader of a group of other young dipshits, who saw him as this totemic mentor-shaman who could hook them up with whatever shit they wanted.  i'm also damn sure he started fucking one of his gang's younger sister (13) around then, but i had nothing to go on but my own instincts, so all i could do was tell her parents to keep an eye on her.  no charges were ever pressed, and the family never spoke to me again after that, but they did pull both of their kids out of that school, and my son was furious at me for daring to not let him continue committing statutory rape.

he decided to try for ""normal"" rape later on.  while i was away, he spent an uncharacteristic night at home and on his best behavior.  after his mother went to sleep, he followed her to her bedroom.  he took a knife with him.  he crept into the room, straddled her, put the blade to her throat, and slid his other hand inside her. 

i don't know exactly what happened next.  i know he held her down and tried to undress her.  i know she fought.  i know he stabbed her. i know she got away and locked herself in the bathroom before he could catch her; i hope that means she kicked him good in the balls.  i know she broke the window and screamed for help.  i know he ran.  i know she was lucky the ambulance got to her before she bled to death.  i know he called his friends to brag and beg a ride.  i know the police caught him.

i know if i'd been home, or if *i'd* caught him, i'd have killed him with my bare hands.

the state tried my son as an adult.  he pled out, but only after making his mother testify and smiling the whole time.  she divorced me a month after his sentencing; i looked too much like him.  she killed herself a year later.

i would be a liar if i said i didn't blame him for her death, because i absolutely do.  he was sober when she went to her room, sober when he pulled out his knife, sober when he climbed on top of her, sober when he raped her, sober when he stabbed her, sober when he ran, sober when he called his friends to brag, and sober when the police found him.  when i made the mistake of visiting him after the divorce, he laughed and said she'd had enough of his dick that i could never satisfy her.  when i made the mistake of visiting him after she killed herself, he laughed again and asked how it felt to have ""some prick take your bitch away.""

i should have killed him right there.  it is to my eternal shame that i did not.

they let him out after serving three years.  he spent the next six years on the streets, in and out of rehab, on and off other people's couches, and would grace me every six months or so with a phone call demanding money.  eventually i refused to talk to him unless it was to drive him back to rehab, and i stopped completely after he stole my wallet.  

two years ago, he came to my house with his aunt (his mother's sister) in tow and crocodile tears in his eyes.  he pretended to apologize.  i slammed the door.  his aunt barges in to try to shame me into forgiving the man who raped my wife, caused her death, and laughed about; he stayed outside.  he slashed my tires, threw a brick through a window, and drove off in her car.  his aunt had no idea that he'd taken or keys, or that he'd been armed the whole time.  she blamed me.

he guilted her into letting him stay with her, went to rehab and relapsed, then went again, and here we are.  

in stark contrast to the ball of shit that is my son and his life, i have watched my friends' and colleagues' (those who will still talk to me, that is) children go on to become doctors, lawyers, skilled tradesmen, actors and musicians, academics, entrepreneurs, and career military.  i've seen a few start their own families.  and even the ones who've had a rough start, or who stumbled and fell, managed to pick themselves up again, or are bravely soldiering on.  i have nothing but respect for them.  i also note that *they* do not expect juice and a fucking cookie for having a job and not getting hopped up on meth or raping their mothers for 18 whole months.

my son has pretended to reform before.  he has even convinced himself once or twice.  but he always backslides, always relapses, always finds new ways to disappoint, always hurts other people for his own short-sighted benefit.  his aunt is already at the stage where she is pretending she ""must have forgotten"" where she put some knickknack or piece of jewelry, and has already told me to fuck off after i've warned her of what my son can, will, and has done before, and what he will do again now that he thinks she is weak.  when he fucks up again, when he hurts someone else with his ceaseless bullshit, i will not be there to pick up after him.  i am through with him.  i am through with his aunt.  i cannot talk to her without being overcome with rage and shame as i see the stupid, stupid hope i used to have that my son would ever amount to anything, and i do not need any more disappointment and failure in my life.

i am not proud of my son.  i am sorry for inflicting him upon the world.",11
"i heard my neighbors puppy get hit by a car last night. so my neighbors got a new black lab puppy a few months back, he's super cute and looks about 6 months old. i typically mind my own business and don't talk to my neighbors much but they are really nice people. 

last night i was outside putting up some christmas decorations and saw the puppy in their yard across the street. i didn't think much of it because he's outside sometimes so i figured they had an electric fence or something.

while i'm turned around i hear this big thud then hear this poor dog let out the most awful scream. i freaked out and ran across the street and he was sitting on the side of the road and looked up at me and he looked so scared. i ran up to their door and let them know because i was the only one who heard it happen. 

i'm 6 months pregnant and this literally freaked me out so bad i can't stop crying about it, i keep hearing that puppy scream in my head and everyone is acting like it's no big deal. 

update: i just saw my neighbors come home and they were carrying the puppy into the house so he survived it luckily!! 

update #2: i talked to my neighbors and the little guy has a bruised lung and 2 hairline fractures on his pelvis but the vet said he'll make a full recovery!",11
"i just realized i'm 1 year self-harm free and i'm so happy to be alive like never before.. it was august 27 the last time i did it, i remember it because my blood by twenty one pilots was released. yesterday i went to their show and listening to that song reminded me of that and it made me extremely proud of myself because i worked hard the whole year to feel better. one year later i'm safe and more than okay, life is going great and i'm still working on myself but it's not as hard as it used to be. 
i just wanted to say that it really gets better, it's not a fake phrase. you will get better. i promise you. i'm proud of you for keep going everyday. please if you can find support, go to therapy and if you can fight to make it become a free option for everybody in need.
i love you all.

"we're calling off the wedding. last night my fiance and i sat down and had a frank conversation. 
things have been going really poorly for our relationship lately. we've spent lots of nights fighting over catering and budgets, who to invite and leave off the guest list. at one point we were screaming over the color of tablecloths. our couples therapist is making bank right now over the increase of our visits. 

finally last night we both had enough. we sat across the table from one another and decided to call the whole thing off. fuck the deposit and the linens, and my future mother-in-law's wishes. fuck it all. what a crock of shit. 

last night we called it off. last night we also spontaneously bought tickets to scotland. we're going to secretly elope to the isle of skye. i feel like a huge burden has been lifted from both of our shoulders.   ",11
"it took 24 years, but i finally kissed the girl i had a crush on in grade 11.. she was one of those popular girls in high school.  heck, she was better than those popular girls at school because she never gossiped or said anything bad about anyone to anyone.   she was nice to me, always said hello to me, always smiled.  she was the one all the boys wanted.  i helped her out once on a school project and as a thank you she took me out to dinner when she was driving me home (she had a license and i didn't!).  i had such a crush on her.  

&nbsp;

what shot did a nerdy (my mom still bought my clothes for me at 16!) bookworm like me have with a popular girl like her?  even though i knew she'd say no, i don't think i could have dealt with the rejection so i never tried asking her out.  after high school, i would run into her occasionally at the clubs and sometimes when visiting friends at her school (we went to different colleges in town).  and that was pretty much it, after i graduated i didn't see her at all and she passed into memory.

fast forward to this year. i've changed quite a bit obviously, more confident and comfortable in my skin as all adults should be by now (although ironically, i'm posting this with a throwaway).  she popped up on my recommended friends list on facebook so i added her.  we started chatting, catching up on what happened to the both of us after high school and made plans to meet up for dinner to catch up in person.

&nbsp;

meeting up at dinner, she still looked every bit as beautiful as the day i met her.  still the same pinball smile and bright eyes that all made my heart skip a beat everytime she looked my way in highschool.  she told me that she had always found me nicer than the other boys at school and really cute and smart.  i admitted to her that i had a huge crush on her all throughout high school.  she acted surprised and asked me why i didn't ask her out if i had a crush.  a little part of me died knowing that i actually had a shot with her back then.  dinner was wonderful and we went out to a pub for a quick evening drink and made plans to meet up again on the weekend.

&nbsp;

and then as we were walking back to our vehicles, we stopped and said goodnight and we finally kissed.  16 year old me would be so proud.",11
"today makes 9 years sober..  

i never thought it would happen.  i never thought i would break the addiction cycle.  but... here i am.  stronger than i ever thought i could be.  

at one point, i remember sitting in my room, doing anything i could to numb the pain of life.  i hated myself.  i hated myself so much that i was killing myself a little each day, and i was okay with that.  i didn't care what happened, i just wanted the ""head change"" that would come each time i picked up the pipe.  i would try to remember a time when life wasn't so ridiculously hard.  

i could look back upon my life and try to pinpoint the exact moment i became an addict.  but why?  what would it matter?  i know who i am today, i know my limits and i know where i belong.  i have family (which isn't always blood) and they love me and support me unconditionally.  i have a husband, and children, we have a home and we are saving to buy a house.  i never thought i could have those things.  they weren't for me.  i was worthless.  

overall, the last 9 years have been better than i ever thought i deserved.  my feelings of gratitude to my friends that support me, and have forgiven me, is immeasurable.  i get slightly emotional when i look back.  i couldn't have done it without them.  while the last 2-3  years, we have grown apart slightly (just life stuff), they will always be spoken of very highly by me, as i would not be the person i am today without their willingness to forgive and willingness to support me through one of the hardest times of my life.  

i don't really talk about ""the dark years"" now.  i feel like i'm officially on the other side of them.  i guess that's why i'm posting here.  i'm thankful that i have this outlet.  

i would also encourage anyone struggling with a drug or alcohol problem:

you can do it. you are worth it.  


thanks for reading.  be blessed today.

edit:. thank you all so much for your kind words.  you have all made my ""birthday"" so special.  i'm sorry i couldn't reply to everyone (i had to go back to work) but i'm trying, and i've read them all.  also!  thank you for the silver!",11
"the next person who says ""aren't you a little young to be using a cane?"" is getting the ugly truth about why i need it.. edit: holy fuck this blew up. i've been bouncing around subreddits for a while now but have never had a post gain this much traction. to answer some of the common questions: yes, i have cut off contact with her. i did so about a year ago after confronting her about the mess she made of my life. no, i never got the chance to report her, she herself was a social worker so the odds of anything happening was zilch. i don't care a whole lot what people think, but after a while it gets really old when people do this shit, which is why i wrote this post. 

edit: thank all of y'all so much for your kind replies. i carry my past around with me invisibly, and sometimes it just gets so frustrating that i can't just yell ""i""m trying my best with what i was dealt."" i made the decision last year to forgive her, simply because holding onto my hatred was poisoning me. thanks to the support of my best friend and her mother, my mentor, and the wonderful healing powers of cannabis, i'm back on the path to chasing my dream. she isn't in my life, and if everything goes according to plan, her effect on my life won't be around in a couple years either. i'll be in my dream school making it work, and she'll still be the same miserable shell of a human she's always been. 

i'm 20 years old, and for the past three years or so, i've needed to use a cane part-time. mostly in the winter, but as time goes on i've needed it more frequently. when my pain flares up, walking without it feels like my feet, shins, and knees are breaking when i walk. the longer i try to tough it out, the more the pain crawls up my body. the cane takes a pain level of a seven or eight and brings it down to a manageable three or four. 

i hate the stares i get. when i take the bus, older people give me hateful glares for sitting down in the seats reserved for disabled and elderly people. even with my cane in my hand, they stare at me like i just slapped them. people my age gawk at me when i'm out and about. the nicer people try to joke about it. laughing, they ask ""aren't you a little young to be using a cane?"" 

yes. yes, i am a little young to be using a cane. you want to know what else i was a little too young for? i was too young to be thrown around like a fucking rag doll by my mother. i was too young to be snatched by my hair and dragged down stairs. i was too young to have my face thrown into cat shit for being a forgetful ten year old who was too busy fantasizing about suicide to remember to clean it out. i was too young to be grabbed by my hair and have my legs swept to be thrown to the floor whenever it amused my mother. i was too young to be forced to ""train"" until my joints popped out of place, my knuckles bled, and i was barely able to breathe. i was too young to be forced to fight adults three and four times my size. i was too young to be hit with bamboo and solid wood swords until i bruised and bled three times a week whenever i couldn't hold forms perfectly. i was too young to be ""restrained"" with my face shoved into a concrete floor, simply because i didn't want to stand there while my mother took out her anger on me with a belt. i was too young to have my body broken to the point that i don't know if i'll ever have functioning joints again. i was too young to be the scapegoat and punching bag of a six foot tall, 300 lb woman. 

so yes, i'm a twenty year old using a cane. for the first time in my life, i have access to tools that make my days less painful. i'm too young to need it, but my mind and body have been aged so much by the violence done to me that it doesn't really matter. shut the fuck up and let me sit down when i get on the bus. you don't know how much pain i'm in.

"i'm 30, i'm ""boring"", i'm single, and i've never been more okay with myself.. i'm just not ""cool"" anymore to my friends. i can't stand drinking copious amounts of alcohol anymore. i show up, and i just wish i was at home reading a book with the dog curled up beside me. it's not that i don't ever drink or like to go out, but it's not that fun anymore. i've done it, repeatedly, for about a decade. i look at the drink prices and think of the cab fare (and possibly even the drunk food), and that's a really nice day trip somewhere or an experience i really want to do, like some kind of cooking class or craft workshop. i don't want to have to have friends whom i have to constantly try to outdrink or be loud for hours on end. i don't want to scream over music anymore, and most cocktails taste crappy to me now. besides, i hate that feeling where i'm parched because i haven't had enough water.

i'm now considered the boring friend. i had my drink and i want to go home. just be lucky i even came out. whenever i come out, i just look around me and wish i stayed in now. i want to wake up early and wash the dishes, swiffer the floor, and make a nice avocado smoothie. i find a great sense of satisfaction when i organize that little pile of receipts and papers on my coffee table. i'm kinda now turned on by tracking my spending.

i get that in my circle i'm supposed to be raging til 4am and sleep the sunday away, but i just can't do it. i don't want to take an ibuprofen and drink excess amounts of coffee just to lay about and check my facebook feed, and really, cleaning my home and listening to a nice podcast sets the tone for the start of a new week. i get that i might have missed out on the crazy story, memory, and possibly even sexual experience, but that's fine. i don't want to awkwardly fumble about with a stranger that i have no foundation with anyway. i don't need the validation anymore or the notch on my belt. i'd rather be wearing flannel pants.

i know that this might mean that i am eternally single, and i've accepted this. if ""putting myself out there"" means getting a free drink and throwing myself at a guy , or even worse, playing ""the female who can come on the strongest""  wins, i'll accept my losses. can i please leave now? i used to get really butthurt about this stuff, but i kinda like me now. this took a whopping 30 years, and it's an absolute miracle. i still have a lot of self work to do, but eating decently and moving about and wearing flattering clothes and putting on a little makeup seems to help with my confidence. i think i'm kinda cute and, in dating terms, cast my net out for reasonable. surely, out of 7 billion people, there's some guy out there that also feels the same way i do.

i'm finding myself really interested in trying new things like hiking or even trying out online gaming. i want to forge more meaningful connections with people. now  i'm the boring, (mostly) sober friend, and that's totally okay. i'm willing to set people free. it's funny because i think i've never been so well-rounded as an individual. it saddens me that the people i know don't see how much i've learned or tried. i'm aware i need a different friends group. you don't have to tell me twice.

it's not to say i won't ever go out again, but there's a life outside of the bar.

i'm just now really happy to stay home.

i'm sure millions upon millions of people out there feel similar, so this is hardly interesting or unique. it just feels special to me because it's finally my ""aha"" moment, and mine is: being ""boring"" is cool.

&#x200b;

edit: wow, this is a really odd and cool experience. thanks for the gold. i've never gotten one before! i think i'm painfully average in this feeling, but it's just been an odd revelation. it reminds me of the blink 182 lyric ""well i guess this is growing up."" 

&#x200b;

also, i've been taking legitimate steps to be more purposeful in my social interactions and just overall basic living. i've reached out to a friend about starting dnd. i've been getting more active on meetup, browsing coursera, studying spanish on memrise and goodreads. i figured those are some avenues that some people may be unfamiliar with, and it seems like good hobbies/ ways to meaningfully connect with others. thanks again. <3",11
"i lost my everything.. this morning, my girlfriend and soul mate of 6 years passed away from an intentional overdose. she called me right before and i heard it all happen over the phone. i called her mom to check on her and she was found convulsing and seizing and when the paramedics arrived she stopped breathing but they got a light pulse. unfortunately by the time they made it to the hospital she had died. i spent 3 hours in the hospital with her body holding her cold hand begging for her to wake up. she was my everything and i now feel like i have nothing. she was only 21. so young, she did not deserve this. i'm just glad she's no longer suffering. i'll always love you erica. please come back. hold onto your loved ones. i have no words for this. i'm still so numb.

"i thought i'd be dead from suicide before high school graduation. instead, i'm still kickin' and will be starting my final year of college next week!. i'm writing all of this out in an attempt to show myself how strong i've been and be optimistic that things will get better. i never ever talk about myself unless i have to so this is all weird to me. it's the end of the week and i'm just reflecting back on everything thus far. i hope it all works out. 

here we go: i've battled depression for 8 years, anxiety for 7 years, and had suicidal thoughts for 2-3 of them. i started self harming in 2015 until 2018, meaning i've been 1.5 years clean. i have an abusive parent and a dysfunctional family. i remember setting a deadline for myself to be gone by because things were really that bad and i didn't have anybody. 

i worked my ass off, graduating high school with honors and a year's worth of college credits under my belt (2016). throughout my entire life, i got really good at compartmentalizing to cope. it meant separating emotions from school/work. even was i was feeling suicidal and in tears, i could still be trying to solve calculus problems or do other assignments. the pressure to perform well was always there. because i did well in school and there was never a dip in my grades, none of my teachers suspected anything was wrong. 

i started seeing someone my second year of college (2018), guy #1, who told me to drop out of my major and honors program and choose something easier. he said i was trying too hard. funnily enough, he was a former frat boy who had gotten academically suspended his freshman year and retake classes, used to have an alcohol problem, and was just irresponsible overall with no self awareness (i didn't realize the red flags at the time - i was naive and inexperienced). then he sexually assaulted me. this is when i gave in and hurt myself. that was over a year ago. the next person i saw later that year, guy #2, sexually coerced me as well. they're both out of my life. some believe me, some don't.

during the rollercoaster of emotions, i threw myself into bettering my career (compartmentalizing, once again) and landed an internship. my emotions and those experiences were/are so confusing. i was only a sophomore but really wanted to narrow down what i wanted to do. i found out i really liked health management and ended up adding another bachelor's and related minor my junior year (2019), making it 2 for 2. 

so fuck you guy #1!!! 

this summer, i balanced 4 classes that went 2x as quick as normal classes and 25 hrs/week at the internship (i just got my grades back and have all a's!!!). 

i ended that internship recently due to logistical reasons with travel for the upcoming school year. everything ended on a good note though, my boss is awesome and still wants to keep in touch. but i panicked at the possible resume gap and how it'd affect my chances of landing another one. you see, i need to find a full time internship on my own and complete it to graduate for one of my degrees.

luckily, i just was offered and accepted a job in my field that pays nearly double that and is only on weekends. it's a job typically for people with more experience or a degree. i began training immediately and am picking up on things really quick. today was my 3rd day of training and both my trainer and the director have noticed i'm doing really well. 

i also start classes next week and i'm really nervous. i want to maintain my high gpa to graduate summa cum laude. i'm looking at graduate school soon and know i want a master's. i know i'll keep trying and trying, even when i have super negative thoughts. i have a hard time being proud, optimistic, and not worrying over the same thing over and over again. 


thank you!

edit: thank you! i didn't think it would blow up. i honestly just vented. i was feeling down at the time, like nothing i've done so far was enough. i also will try to respond to everybody but that'll take time. if it helped just one person though that's enough to make me better! also, i'm a girl :)",11

"my first day alone in eight years and it truely feels good.. i woke up when i wanted to, he didn't wake me up at 4am just so i could get his things ready for the day. i got to eat breakfast this morning, he wasn't there to call me a fat pig for eating. i got to put on makeup for the first time in 7+ years, and i missed it.

i do feel a little lonely, i'm so used to being barked at all day that the silence feels....alien to me.


this the first day of the rest of my life and i feel great.

"i became attractive and i'm a little bit in shock. puberty turned me into an attractive man and it's so fucking weird. through out my childhood, from primary school to high school and late teens, i was bullied quite frequently. i was laughed at, ignored and etc. had close to 0 attention from females, never had a gf, basically was a virgin till the age of 21.

in the past years i've became increasingly attractive, lost fat, gained muscle, went through puberty, my facial skin got better.
only in the past months i've started to realize how good looking i became, and holy shit it's so weird.

people treat me with more respect, women hit on me constantly, some people are even intimated by me. it's just so fucking sad to see reality as it is.

i am in shock on how looks plays such a huge fucking roll in our lives, i've noticed it especially when people let loose of their conscious and go drunk/high. and now, even i notice how i do it myself, i try to not do it but it's fucking wired into our brains. we're a bunch of animals with sex in mind all the fucking time.

i'm afraid that i'll become a douche due to my looks. i'm so fucking confused and weirded out. it also bums me out, cause now i'm not sure if women like me for my personality or for my looks.

i just had to share it with someone.

edit: i didn't expect it gain so much exposure, thank you all for the warm and insightful comments!",11
"my fiancee of 10 years left me at the altar. she packed her bags and ghosted me. i just want to die.. i can't do it. i just can't. i have no idea what i did wrong but, i clearly i did do something. i've been dating her for 10 years and known her since i was a kid. we had moved in together, we were soulmates.  i waited so long to get married because, i made a promise i would be in a stable position at my job so we could start a family. i did everything i could for her. 

we were to be married 2 weeks ago. i was at the altar waiting for her. she never came. she disappeared. her family knew and didn't say a thing. they all watched as i waited for her to come. when they found her gone, everyone looked at me. can you imagine the shame, the humiliation i felt at that moment? i cried, i fucking broke down and cried like a baby in my dads arms.

i went home and she had already gone. she had clearly planned this in advance. everything was gone. no note, no nothing. her family weren't talking to us either. they cut us out. they were in on it. they always hated me. they always said i wasn't good enough for her...

i can't get over it. i can't. i was supposed to be on my honeymoon this week. i was supposed to be having the time of my life with my wife. now i'm sleeping alone in the dark. i've been drinkin all day, everyday. i just want the pain to stop. i can't go on like this.

i loved her, i loved her for more then anything. she was my life, my best friend. i don't know what to do but,i just cant go on it hurts too bad.",11
"i hate when people assume i'm not educated because i work retail.. i graduated with a bachelors degree four years ago. i work retail because it's the only job around in the rural area i'm in while i pay off debt and save up to move elsewhere. 

and there seems to be this prevailing notion that retail is a 'poor man's job,' or one for the uneducated. it really ticks me off. 

baby boomers are the worst offenders. i just had an elderly man come up to me and get in my face (yes, i mean literally) and tell me ""this is a test, like one in college— i mean high school, that's probably as far as you've gotten. where's the honey?"" 

i just looked at him and told him ""aisle one. looks like my bachelors degree is good for something after all."" i said it as cheerfully as i could muster and with a smile. he just blinked and shuffled away, hopefully humbled by the interaction. 

i've had far worse though. i've had people straight up yell at me if i failed high school bc we didn't have something they wanted in stock or if i didn't count change fast enough, as if me having a lower education had anything to do with it. 

there are so many people in retail from all walks of life, of all forms of education. it just grinds my gears when dumb customers try to make assumptions about you or your life. retail workers honestly deserve more than they get, and i wish working retail or fast food was a requirement to teach people how to be humble. 

edit; holy fuck i really didn't expect this to blow up like it has. i made a comment yesterday before i shut off notifications because i was getting overwhelmed but it's comforting to know a lot of folks have dealt with similar situations and i hope my post allowed some people to reach some kind of catharsis by venting their own experiences. 

for the curious, the degree was a b.s. in biology with the intention to teach. i was gung ho when i began only to be completely disheartened and kind of miserable by the time i finished. i realized my heart was elsewhere in computer science. i plan on going back for it eventually, but i'm keeping my chin up during this 'in-between' period while i save up money. thankfully my job pays pretty well and has good benefits so it's not all bad. good pay, same retail gripes. 

anyway, happy holidays! ",11
"i got accepted into yale law yesterday, so fuck you racist fuckheads.. i'm a dark-skinned black guy from the deep south. i have attended a state college for the past few years while getting my undergraduate degree. simultaneously, my mother has been dying of aids and i have been working to support both of us. 

i applied to yale as a joke, really. no one expects to go. i asked one of my professors to be a reference and he laughed and asked me, ""can you even talk right? do you even know what yale is?"" fuck you, asshole.

it doesn't mean ""open to all tongues and fingers""

i know. i know. i am probably nerding the f out right now since it is not directly obvious how significant this is.

getting published in a prestigious journal is an experience that has the potential to greatly affect a young/up and coming scientist's life.

all of the insane drama i've made peace with.
all of the people who undermined my intelligence, skill and hard work. simply because of the color of my skin.

i want to scream at the top of my lungs.
but it is late...so reddit, i will just yell to you.

i am finally proud of myself.


**edit**
thank you everyone!!! i can't believe the amount of encouragement and positivity coming from complete strangers. reading through your comments had me tearing up again.

you guys are awesome, and reading about your own experiences is inspiring.
to anyone who's struggling right now in the harsh world of academia: 
take it from someone who has continuously fallen so much, the ground has became my home. as cliche as it sounds: **do not give up!! keep pushing!! keep climbing!! find amazing mentors, work hard and surround yourself with positive people and the world will be your oyster. you will get there.**

thats the biggest piece of (general) advice i can give. do not underestimate the power of your workplace environment. a toxic environment will surely deter you from your full potential, while an encouraging, supportive one will fuel your ambition. so surround yourself with people that have good positive energy. 

i will try to answer as many as the specifics questions i can once i get home. ",11

"my aunt and older brother fell in a river 36 hours ago. the numbness brought on by the entire ordeal is indescribable. my household is in turmoil, and in the midst of it i don't know where my new course of life leads.


over the weekend my aunt and older brother decided to travel together to medellin. they had both talked about the planned trip for a long time, and were both super psyched. our last communications were a number of photos my brother sent to my mom of them at a forested park area. the last photo was received at 1pm approximately.  we wouldn't hear anything of them for the next 24 hours.


the sunday i returned from picking up groceries to find her in hysterics with the phone clutched to her chest. she was muttering that they fell in a river. now, knowing my mother i just assumed she was being a bit fatalistic, she gets like that at times. to this day, despite working at my job for a year she never fails to tell me to ""stay safe and don't do anything dangerous"". this time though, there was more, the tears, the shaking, this time was different. after pressing her for more details she gave me the full story as recounted by the third person traveling with them.


the trio had just gotten done *exploring a river after a hike* outside a little town called cocorna. my aunt, brother and a co-worker of my aunts had gone for a swim with about 3 others. *close to the end of the swim it seemed sudden weather had set in causing the river to begin to swell. the three other bathers managed to exit the water before the surge came bursting down, but my aunt, brother and the third individual were caught in the swell. all three were washed downstream. my aunt's coworker was found 2 or so hours later downstream clinging to an outcropping in the surging river for dear life.*

"hi reddit. my dad died last night.. my dad attempted suicide twice when i was in high school. the divorce hit him the hardest, he lost everything he ever loved. i understand why he would want to end it. i used to lay in bed at night and imagine different scenarios of me finding out he killed himself again. i was preparing myself, because i couldn't let myself get caught off guard again. everytime he, my grandma, or my brother called me, my first thought would be ""this is it.  he did it this time"". its been over 10 years and i still had that thought. 

i thought i was prepared. but last night when i got the call that he died, turns out i wasnt prepared at all. he died of believed natural causes, the coroner still isn't sure what his exact cause of death yet.  but he said it doesnt look like suicide. so i guess that's good, right? 

but....hes gone for real this time. it doesnt matter how it happened. i'm not ready. 



edit: wow everyone, thank you for all of your kind words. the coroner determined that his cause of death was a mixture if hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes (he refused to believe he had it) and heavy heavy smoking. it was all too much for his heart. so as one poster said, he literally died of a broken heart. 

while i'm relieved that he didn't take his own life, the fact that his death was preventable makes it even harder to deal with. but so many of you are right, he's no longer suffering, he's no longer unhappy. he's free of all of his physical and mental pain. im still overwhelmed and in shock...i miss his so much. but my friends have been extremely supportive, in a way i could never imagine. and so have you all. thank you all for sharing your stories. i've saved many of your posts to read in the future for the bad days. you all are amazing. 💜 anyone is welcome to pm me if they want to talk further. my inbox is open 💕",11
"earlier this year i outed my father, film director rob cohen, as a rapist and child molester. this morning someone else came forward.. from the huffington post this morning:

""by the night's end, jane said she found herself regaining consciousness in cohen's hotel room, naked, while the director sexually assaulted her. she jolted out of bed and threw up.""",11
"my aspergers mate got married at the weekend. i was his dyspraxic best man. i've never been more proud of him or myself.. my best mate has aspergers syndrome. i have dyspraxia. to keep this post a somewhat reasonable length, many things aren't easy for either of us, namely socialising. we've been best mates from school for over 20 years. 

he got married on saturday to a wonderful (neuro typical) woman. there was a worry that the occasion might be overwhelming for him. with everyone he knows wanting to socalise the crap out of him. to the point where there was a special quiet room set aside for him to use should he need to use it. in the event, he took the whole thing in his stride. honestly, i've never seen him so at ease and relaxed. and happy. and i've never been so fing proud of him.

for my part i had to step up. as a dyspraxic, organisation doesn't come naturally to me. i had 7 groomsmen to organise to ensure that everything went smoothly and to keep him happy and relaxed. oh and a speech to perform. 

i got him to the venue on time. everything went smoothly as i'd been clear about what everyone had to do. i performed my speech. and whilst i couldn't stop shaking throughout, it was warmly recived. people laughed when they were supposed to.

his family came up to me afterwards to give me a massive group hug. to tell me i'd been a good friend to him. this pretty much made me blub.

after this i gave him a bro hug (thanks to his now wife, he's gotten better at physical contact. did l say how amazing she is?) no words. just we fing made it pal.

edit 2: wow! rip my inbox! i did not expect this level of response when i went to bed last night! i don't have time to reply to all of the messages, just to say thanks for all the congratulations and well wishes (and the gold!) reddit is truly wholesome sometimes and you're all lovely people and i wish you all well.

"ex bf tried to rape me last night. as the title says. 
he was in town and asked if he could crash at my house. i said yes. he does this sometimes. he sleeps in the spare bedroom. last night he came over and was saying how horny he was. i denied his advances. eventually it turned into me bitting, scratching and kicking him in the balls to get him off of me. i told him i'd call the police if he did manage to rape me. he was just like ""no you won't"". the whole time my dog is going crazy trying to get between us (wish she'd bit him). it ended with me getting to the kitchen and picking up a knife. which got him to stay away. i got him to go outside and i locked the door. this whole thing lasted probably 5 mins. one thing i'm proud of is fighting him off; i didn't give up. i don't plan on telling anyone about this because it's kinda extreme. i mean i pulled a knife on this guy. sorry for the jumbled up thoughts. cheers, reddit. 

*edit* 

thank you everyone so much for your kind words and support. i plan on filing a report when no one else is home (for privacy). i know as much as the next girl that without proof not much can be done. i don't live alone. i was actually surprised no one heard the fighting. i wanted to punch him but i didn't, i wanted to hurt him, but i didn't. i was embarrassed to be literally caught in that situation. so i didn't call for help. i probably didn't leave any marks on him because i wasn't trying to hurt him, i was just just trying to make him let me go and stop. i did text him later in the night and told him he was never welcome at my home again. i never plan on seeing him again. ive looked into restraining orders but they're apparently hard to get in my state without a ""reason"" (that can be proved).  i want to add that to the few that said i would be somewhat responsible if he did this to another girl and i didn't do what i'm obligated to do which is to report this and then it happen to another girl...i would feel guilty forever. one day he may have children and what if they bring a girlfriend over and he does this to her? i want everyone who's concerned about my mental well being that i'm ok. if anything i feel empowered. i won. i feel silly saying that. but i did it guys. i fought off my attacker and i won. thank you again for all the encouragement and good advice. also thank you for the tough love from some commenters.

"i'm a first nations elder, i want to tell my story.. i wanted to tell my story on the internet, because my grandson has recently been diagnosed with depression, i don't mean to try offend anyone or hurt anyone, i simply want to tell my story.

&#x200b;

my name is john, and i used to live on a reserve in northern alberta, i'm 52, and i was lucky enough to never go to a residential school, 

&#x200b;

my family didn't have much money, same as all of us on the reserve, i grew up playing outdoors, damming up creeks with rocks, and clay that we scooped out with spoons, my mother was a hard working woman, she cooked us 3 meals a day, and spent most of her time making sure our house was presentable. she would always say that there's no point in moping around and trashing our house, it was truly all we had to be completely honest, 

&#x200b;

both of my parents were alcoholics, my dad especially, no matter what my mother did to make the house presentable, the living room would never stop smelling of cigarettes and beer, my father was mean when he was drunk, i don't think he knew what he was doing either, his eyes almost changed color from when he was drunk and not drunk, there was sometimes violence, and i had my fair share of it, i still have nightmares about it to the day,

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

i was strangely whimsical about my culture, if you've ever watched the movie smoke signals, i was a lot like thomas, i thought that everything had a story to tell, it does too. if you stand near the water it'll tell you it's story. you can't understand it, but you've just gotta listen. i would never hurt animals that weren't the fish, i couldn't stand seeing a deer's eyes as it bled out, animals have a story too. you can see it in the way they walk, and in the color of their coat. 

&#x200b;

when i grew to be a teenager, i became extremely self-destructive. i had a girlfriend that equally complimented my problems with more of her own, the first time i became blackout drunk was at the age of 13. i remember waking up the next morning on my girlfriends lawn, standing up, feeling the blood rush to my head, the feeling of flight, and then falling back down and vomiting all over my clothes, i went inside and she had done the same thing. 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

the feeling of being drunk my first time was almost breathtaking for me, it felt like everything wrong flew away and i was capable of doing anything, 

&#x200b;

the occasional drinking turned into alcoholism, and that turned into many stupid decisions, at the age of 17, me and my girlfriend were drunk driving, i crashed into a boulder on the side of the road, my girlfriend made it out with minor injuries and a broken leg, i got out with shattered ribs, a broken arm, and a broken collarbone,

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

my destructive habits continued into my 20s, when i was 23 i decided to stop drinking, leave my girlfriend, and try start a new life, 

&#x200b;

i moved away, lived well for a year, and then fell into a horrible depression, i felt like all i needed was a chance to go home, after that i went back home, 

&#x200b;

i took long walks around the mountains where i lived, i came to peace with myself and those around me, after a few years, reconciling with my father and mother, i left, and started working for construction in british columbia, where i remain to this day.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

it hurts my heart to see children in pain, i know you don't want to hear it, but the sun has to set to rise again, be thankful that you've been given the opportunity to breathe the air you breathe, life is shitty sometimes, but if you go through it with your head held high, and your spirit held higher, you'll come out a greater person than the one that you were before

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

the colors around you are vivid, and the life you've been given is the only one you get, i know it might seem bad, but please, you are needed, you are a part of what makes the air around you worth breathing,

goodnight, someone out there loves you.",11
"i'm confident and ready for tonight. so my girlfriend is coming over later... for the talk. the talk that i very much so think will be our last. we've been together for 4.5 years. i love her so so so much. but i don't think she'll be telling me the same here tonight. i was going to propose earlier this year. and when i brought up the idea of getting engaged, she told me not to. not directly, but said ""let's look again later in the summer"". the sinking feeling started then. and little things here and there that she said, i now realize amount to me being blind i didn't see this coming. this past week we have been on a break that she wanted. i agreed, but i didn't tell her how badly it dragged my heart through the mud. today is the day she said she has a lot to tell me. but only face to face. i've been steadily... desperately trying to prepare myself for this moment. i think i'm about as ready as i'll get. i'm confident it will go well, albeit i probably won't be. i'm confident for tomorrow. i'm confident for my future. i won't lie, i'm holding out for the fact she may just lay some things out and may be willing to work it out. but i won't let that thought get the better of me. it's her choice. and i respect it. here's to a bright future. either way. i'll be happy with her, or i'll learn to be happy without.

update: 
i appreciate everyone giving both their support, and their opinions. for no one here knowing me, or nearly my whole story, i thank you from the bottom of my heart.
so she came over. and to what many, among myself expected, this was indeed the end. we both cried, and read through old letters. she admitted her feelings were falling away. she believes we have become too different of people. her career may bring her out of the state, once she graduates. i have been working on getting a cdl to follow her where she may go. i doubt i'll be going for that anymore now. regardless, we ended beautifully. i think she was much more worried with how i was going to take it than i was. while i did want us to move forward together, i'm glad she's relieved to go where she needs to go. i will always have a special spot in my heart for her. and she said the same.

for now, i'm watching some star trek: the next generation. it always helped occupy my mind. here i go to where many have been before! ""engage""!",11
"i put a ladybug out in almost freezing temperatures and left it. i know this is stupid but i don't really know why this is hitting me so hard. 

last night i was sitting in my room when something moved out of the corner of my eye. i flinched at first because i thought it was a bug, but i realized it was a ladybug which i've always loved. it was below freezing and i knew he came in for warmth, but i knew he would starve if he stayed in forever, so i decided to let him stay in my room for the night in a container with a little bit of water, and i would release him the following morning.

well.. right now is the following morning. i woke up and he was in a different spot than when i went to sleep so i knew he was walking around looking for something to do, i knew it was time to release him since it's just about the warmest it'll be all day, but it's still almost freezing. i felt sad as i picked up his container and carried it outside, but like i said i knew he would starve to death for sure if he stayed inside, and i didn't want to interfere with nature's course that much anyways so i knew he had to go. 

i went outside and found a little tree and some soil to put him by and let him crawl out into it. i stood up and looked at him and he was so small and he was walking around, and instantly i felt like crying. i'm a 22 year old man and i had to cut myself off from looking at him because i thought i was about to cry outside in public. i got back to my room and i started crying, just the image of how small he was, alone and probably cold and hungry and how i had to turn my back on him.

i don't know why i feel so bad. i believe in my logical reasons for having to release him, but i can't help but think, what if i could keep him inside and warm and well fed and stuff. i don't know. like i said i know this is dumb but i kinda just had to vent. thank you

edit: wow, i didn't expect anything like this kind of response. i wrote this 14 hours ago on this alternate account of mine, and just now i was browsing the home page of reddit on my main account and came across a post on this subreddit about a ladybug with 2.8k upvotes, over a hundred comments, and gold/silver, it took me a moment to realize it was my own and i'm completely blown away. there's so much support, advice, and just general thoughts put into all these comments and pm's that i don't even know where to begin. 

from what i've learned in this thread and some personal research, ladybugs are more resilient to the cold than i initially thought and have numerous methods for coping with it - obviously not all of them survive but there's at least the hope that he's okay. even if he doesn't, a lot of direction was given regarding dealing with that possibility. i, and from the looks of it most of you, want him to survive, but all of it is honestly just nature's process and in the end there's only so much we can, or should, do. it still saddens me, the image of that small, lonely ladybug against the elements as i got up to walk away, but i'm much more accepting of it now.

i appreciate all of the kind words and thoughts put into this little venting session of mine. i would love to reply to each and every one of you but i hope this edit and a few replies can show how much it means to me, i've read through all of your replies and they are all appreciated. thank you all so much. i hope at the very least this can spread the positives of empathy and bring a little more care to people's hearts.",11
"when my mom first met my father, he lied about graduating from a top university. i just got into that university.. gonna keep this short and sweet. my mom met my father 25 years ago. one of the many lies who told her about his status and upbringing etc was that he graduated from an extremely top university (about the same prestige as harvard for a us equivalent). after several occasions of sleeping with expensive escorts in foreign countries, my mom divorced him and raised me and my three siblings on her own in a foreign country where she knew nobody. we went from living literally the lifestyles of multimillionaires to being dirt poor and struggling to get by for so long (though things have been going pretty well recently). 18 years later, my two older brothers and i are all on full scholarships to overseas universities studying medicine and law and i just got accepted into the university he told my mom he graduated from. he is on his fifth wife, declared bankruptcy twice and his son just got arrested for possession.

"in late 2013, a lady in downtown olympia hugged me when i found out my wife committed suicide. my wife was on the east coast and she killed herself.   i was dealing with the aftermath on the phone and you overheard me talking.   we were standing outside the elk building apartments when you overheard.  

i planned on also killing myself when i went back upstairs to my apartment.    you asked me for permission to hug me.    

because of that, i didn't kill myself.  just one small positive emotion derailed the bullet train of emotional darkness i was experiencing at the time.  

my life is amazing again... and i just wish i could thank you properly.     hugs are the one gift that is not rude to give back.   ",11
"i just ate a bowl of soup. doesnt sound like much, but its the first time in a couple months ive had a full serving of something.
i cried before eating it.
i cried over a spoonful of potato salad yesterday.
i cried over a slice of pizza the day before that.
i know its all in my head, and soup isnt that filling, but i had an entire bowl. multiple mouthfuls. my heart was racing the entire time but i did it.

eating is hard but im going to beat this disorder.

pretty long edit: so its 1am, im tearing up reading comments, and ive just woken up from a forced nap because i was attempting to make boiled eggs, messed it up twice (apparently im terrible at cooking boiled eggs?) and then my stomach started hurting too bad for me to stand up. which made me incredibly nervous because i have a phobia of being sick. so intense tummy pains and feeling sick are terrifyinggg. i unfortunately havent been able to eat more since the soup but ill try again today!

i didnt expect any responses to this, let alone this amount and how bloody supportive they all are.
i just needed to talk about my little victory, because while my parents are so so supportive they dont entirely understand how it all works. my family all understand that i am struggling and have been struggling, but theyre very ""its all in your head you need to just get on with it"" kind of people. not in a mean way, just in a them way. 
so its been so lovely reading all of the 100+ comments of pure support. 

at the minute my mindset about recovery is i think pretty damn good. while the thought of gaining weight makes me very uncomfortable, and the thought of not being able to lose weight like i was is mildly upsetting, i absolutely do not want to starve myself anymore. i want nothing more than to be able to eat normaly. 
not eating for months has been horrific, i have felt weak, sick, and dizzy every single day, i have become incredibly anxious about everything, im struggling with any kind of public appearance at all. 
but im hoping once my eating is fixed and my body starts acting somewhat normaly then i can then move to focus on the other things! 
i have had some really scary moments while restricting one being my paramedic neighbour had to take my blood sugar because i was unable to stand up after not eating for 3 days, and basically told me i was close to passing out because it was so low. and honestly i felt like i was dying. i have never been so scared, and i never want to feel like that again. 

there was a point last year where i was eating fairly well, i was going to the gym,i was genuinely happy, and my mental health was the best it had every been. and i am so determined to reach that point again. if i could beat my eating disorder last year, albeit i fell back into it very quickly, then i can sure as hell do it again. 

so once again, thank you all so so much for all of the comments and support. as crappy as my body feels while its trying to get used to actually being fed, the optimism i now how is making me see how bloody worth it its going to be.

i love all of you so much honestly 💕",11
"to the family that took me in:. i was 12 when i left the group home. i was 14 when your father/husband found me wandering the streets. he didn't ask where i came from, he didn't ask what i was doing going through the trash... he asked me if i could go for a hot meal.

you all took me in, you gave me my own room, you bought me new clothes, and you fed me every day for 5 years. you didn't ask about the scars or the beaten down body before you, you only tried to make it ok. i am alive today because of you, and i love every one of you. i live my life with only the purpose that one day i can be a man you can i'll be proud of.

i never got the chance to tell him how thankful i am... and with his recent passing i never will... to all those reading, if you have someone you need to thank please do it. one day it will be too late and you will never get to say what you should have said so many times.

"my sister asked my to plan her gender reveal.. my sister (technically step sister but whatever) found out that she's pregnant about a week ago and is like 11 weeks along, i was the only person who is actually excited because our parents already have four grandchildren. anyways. yesterday i was hanging out with my sister and her boyfriend when they told me that they decided that they want me to do the gender reveal for them. they said that i'm the one person that they trust enough to not tell anyone and to actually make it cool. 

them telling me this almost made me emotional because none of my other sisters have ever involved me at all with their babies or pregnancies, and i've been told so many times that i'm untrust worthy and can't keep my mouth shut. 

in short i'm just so happy that they trust me and chose me to do this for them.",11

edit: this really isn't about the people who accidentally become pregnant despite their best efforts with protection. this is about people who make a conscious effort to have children (i.e. my spouse wants them so i guess i'll tough it out) or carelessly misuse protection. things do happen, and some people will come to love their children. but only some. prevent it when you can.",11

"stop telling me i'm ""lucky i'm so skinny."". i grew up heavy. not super overweight but thick enough that i got bullied and couldn't run as fast as the fast kids in middle school. i've been battling an eating disorder since high school, wake up two hours before my classes to go to the gym, constantly focus on eating right, watch my friends eat pizza and wings while i snack on carrots and celery, and do everything i can to not miss meals, pay attention to the meal reminders on my phone, and really keep myself healthy and in good shape. 

none of this is luck. it's hard work and i struggle a lot. there are days when i don't want to get up but i push myself. there are times when i am so depressed about my body image that i just want to cry looking at the mirror but i just take a deep breath and try to harness that in the next day's workout. 

i work damn hard to be where i am, so it really drives me insane when somebody tells me i'm ""so lucky that i am skinny"" because i am not lucky. i am determined, disciplined, strong, and fighting every day. i'm not adonis by any means and i'm really not even that muscular, but it's hard work and that never gets acknowledged. the whole thing is just chalked up to luck because people don't want to put the work in.

"i'm a guy and i had to fake an orgasm for the first time in my life last night. i've been talking to this girl i met from bumble. first date went well and we ended up having sex and i slept over her place. we had been talking for this last week and i've been getting the feeling she's too into this for how short this time span has been so i tried to give her a chance by meeting up for lunch a couple times and sleeping over again last night.

so last night happens and it's going alright. we talk, watch a movie, it gets late, and i'm tired. she doesn't seem like she wants to have sex as she plainly states ""it's so late and i'm too tired to do it"", so i say ""fine with me"" and lay down to just sleep. she won't stop bothering me about how she doesn't want to go to sleep and keeps asking what i expected to happen tonight and won't take my suggestion we just watch another movie until we both fall asleep. it was crazy annoying and it put into perspective what type of person she is and that we're not on the same wavelength. 

i don't really thirst for sex so just spending time with her was fine but i did bring condoms which she asked why i brought. she keeps bothering me after i tell her i'm just trying to get sleep since she doesn't want to watch a movie until we fall asleep or have sex. she says that she wanted sex the whole time and she was just speaking her mind earlier. i told her she should have just been straight up and told me that's what she wanted. so we get down to business, and i'm thinking to myself ""i'm not into this at all"" but she was enjoying it. there was no way i was going to cum so i just did that final long thrust, twitched my dick a couple of times, and made some satisfied sounds. i thought i was going to get some good sleep, i was wrong though. 

it only gets worse from there but that part of this story is still unfolding this morning and i feel like i've said enough already.

edit: removed an insignificant detail that could link this back to me

"i just met my club penguin best friend of 6 years. back in the day, i was a club penguin fiend.  and like many, i made quite a few online friends from club penguin, most of which i made over my (very cringe-worthy) club penguin fan account on instagram.  those days i had some of the best friends i've ever had, i would stay up every night on kik talking in our groupchat and i'd spend every hour after school on club penguin meeting up with them.

with most of them, we've grown apart and went our separate ways, but i've managed to keep one of my best friends in particular.  even after we outgrew club penguin, we would facetime every day, text each other about our lives, play other video games together, and even send each other christmas and birthday gifts!! she's seen me go through both middle school and high school, and we eventually graduated together too.  she's known me through 3 boyfriends, 2 jobs, the worst depression of my life, and many lonely summers.  she's seen me change and grow, just as i've seen her change and grow too.

a month ago, i finally did it- i booked the ticket to chicago, and i flew in this morning.  when she picked me up from the airport, for the first time in our 6 years of friendship, we gave each other the biggest hug.  it's so surreal!  as i'm writing this, i'm in the guest bedroom of her house, and tomorrow we plan on going to lollapalooza together, after she shows me around her city.  best $600 i've ever spent :)



tl;dr i met one of my bffs on club penguin, we've been friends for 6 years.  today i flew out to chicago and met her for the first time.  it was awesome :)",11
"i'm finally over her. my girlfriend of three years slept with my best friend and, after nearly a year of some of the hardest times of my life, i'm doing better. 

i thought about my lost girlfriend and lost best friend every day for months. it wasn't until today i noticed i hadn't thought about them for weeks. i've been thinking about another girl, and i've been looking forward to seeing other friends. 

i guess i wanted to put out a beacon of hope. i know it hurts now but you'll move on to better things. it's never too late. 

everything will be okay.",11
"we're sitting in a bar, waiting for food and i have a big secret.. across from me, as i type this, is the woman who has been with me through the worst parts of my life. she was there for me, haunted me even, when i was pushing everyone away, when i wanted to end it all, she was there. she deserves the world imo and i'm keeping a big secret from her. in 8 days were getting photos done by an old friend of mine for her mother's chrsitmas present and i'm going to ask her to marry me which is something i never thought i would do. not that she isn't great but marriage spooks me, but with her it's infinitely worth it. i'm so excited i had to tell someone.

edit: wow, thank you all so much for your kind words and we'll wishes! it's enough to bring a tear to my eye :,)'. i'll be sure to post an update!

"first time having sex since being sexually assaulted. today i had sex with my boyfriend of over a year for the first time after being sexually assaulted (and first time w him in general). i started bawling halfway through because i couldn't handle the emotions i was feeling but my partner was so supportive that
 1: i cried even more
but 2: i finally feel like that part of me that my assaulter still had claim over is gone

for so long it was stuck in my head that he still had the power of being the last person i was with and i know it's stupid but for a year i felt like i still had some sort of an attachment to him that i couldn't shake off. after we finished i was finally able to laugh uncontrollably again, that kind of laugh that you feel deep down in your stomach that you can't stop no matter how hard you try. i've missed that feeling so much and i'm forever thankful for having such an understanding boyfriend to help me through this

ps sorry if this breaks any sort of nsfw rules i just wanted to get it off my chest

edit: thank you everyone for your responses i've never felt better in my life and all of you are all beautiful tropical fish (except whoever called me a fixer upper girlfriend, i'm a boy and your moms a ho)

"i was almost raped tonight.. i was just taking recycling out to the bins outside my apartment, maybe 7-8 feet from my back door. i didn't see which direction he came from, but suddenly there was a gun in my face and a man in a ski mask told me i was ""coming with him."" he pushed the gun into my back and ordered me to walk down the alleyway into my neighbors' backyard. i offered him my phone but he told me to shut up and keep walking. once in the dark space between the garbage bins and the garage, he told me to take my shoes off and get on the ground. the whole time, i stayed the calmest i think i've ever been. i have no idea how, but i think it's one of the things that saved my life. i didn't try to fight, and i did what he told me to do.

if it wasn't for the motion sensor lights on the garage, i know he would have raped and/or killed me. they were triggered by me stumbling, and he was scared off. i ran into the building, which was thankfully unlocked, and called 911. a woman came out of the nearest apartment because she heard me knocking and screaming. she and her so were really nice and helpful and kept their door open for me until after the police arrived. i spent almost two hours with officers and sensitive crimes detectives before finally coming back home. i'm still a bit in shock that it happened at all. i live in a decently sized city that people typically say is dangerous, but i stupidly thought my neighborhood was safe.

i posted this to get it off my chest but also as a warning to everyone to just always be careful. i was outside for maybe 30 seconds before this happened. i was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and i don't want anyone else to be in the same position. also, motion sensor lights are great. thank you for listening.",11
"i'm lying to my best friend. my best friend and i have been friends for over 6 years. in november of 2018, she got married and her husband was deployed shortly after. he's been gone since and she thinks he's not coming home for a few months. 

he and i have secretly been messaging on facebook because we're setting up a plan to surprise her with him coming home 4 months early. he's on the phone with her saying they have to finish stuff up but he can't come home early and the ""wifi there sucks"" so she doesn't get suspicious. 

she's heartbroken because she's been hoping he's coming home early for a long time. she thinks he's stuck there for a few more months when he's really coming home early. i want to tell her so badly because i know she'll be excited but i want to surprise her with this because she misses him so so much. 

she cries almost every day whenever she thinks about him or talks about how much she misses him. it crushes me because i know that he'll be home soon but i don't want to ruin the surprise. 

tl;dr best friend thinks husband is going to be deployed for a few more months but we're surprising her with him coming home early

thank you for the silver you kind soul (:

edit: a lot of people are saying that they'd be pissed if it was them, but she loves surprised. when we were younger we would always watch the military homecoming videos together and she was obsessed. i've known her for a while and i know that she wouldn't get mad at either of us for planning this for her (:",11
"i just took the shit of a lifetime. i'm a very small girl (~100 lbs) so i don't require that much food but when i do eat, it's usually fast food or highly processed/fried. since i have a terrible diet that consists of basically 0 fiber i only poop every few days.

the past few days however, i made a huge change in my diet. i started eating **real** food (psa microgreens are amazing, my new favorite thing). also, this morning i put coconut oil in my coffee instead of creamer. those two changes led me to the most glorious poop i've ever taken. i have no idea how that came out of me. i'm at work and was nervous that it wasn't even going to flush. there was like 6 straight up logs that came out effortlessly in under a minute. it was a beast!

last month i got an x-ray done on my spine, which you can see my intestines on, and the doctor put a note in about ""excessive amounts of stool impacted in the colon"" (basically i was super constipated). i'm pretty sure that just resolved itself.

tl;dr: i just took a shit that was so good it felt almost spiritual. i hope something brightens your day as much as this dump just brightened mine",11
"i'm going to be a dad!! it's too early to tell anyone yet but i'm beyond excited and needed an outlet. that is all. have an amazing day

"my husband won't let me kill the spider living in our bathroom.... a few days ago, i commented that the bathroom needed cleaning and said i'd get around to it shortly.

my husband said, ""oh... when you do, try not to disturb the spider that lives behind the toilet.""

me, ""wait, what?""

my husband was surprised i hadn't noticed it yet.  ""just be gentle, okay?  he's not hurting anything.""

my husband is over 50.  he grew up hunting in a small northern town.  he's practical and tough and used to strictly maintain an ""8 foot rule"".  which is something he made up that states any spider who descends below 8 feet from the floor has forfeited all protections and may be killed outright.  he's killed plenty of spiders who got too close to our living space!

but, this one he's decided to keep.  it comes out from hiding when he's brushing his teeth and waves tiny arms at him.  i think maybe it's being aggressive and guarding its territory.  my husband says it's  being friendly.

i asked him what if it lays eggs and we end up with a million million baby spiders.  he shrugged, and stuck a toilet paper roll in front of its hiding place to ""make him feel more comfortable"".  and now here i am, trying to figure out how to clean around the critter without bothering it more than necessary.

can i just say that i find this all completely adorable? 

(i swear, though, if spider-bro ever jumps on me when i'm using the toilet, it's a dead arachnid!)

"im sick of the double standard for big dogs. my friend sent a video of their small dog to our group chat, it was snarling, had its teeth bared, and was nipping, it was clearly doing ""stay away from me"" behaviour, but everyone ignored it, talking about how cute it is.
i called it out saying that their dog seems unhappy and they're obviously distressing it. everyone was saying that thats just how terriers act, and maybe they do, i don't know, but it still fucks me up.
i have a big dog, and if he was to try to bite me and bare his teeth at me everyone would lose their minds. he's been attacked by a small dog before, all because he walked near it at the big dog park. why it was in that part of the park i have no idea. the owner did nothing and i ended up having to kick the little dog away and grab my boy and run. if it had been a larger dog attacking him it would have been put down. it wouldn't have been cute, and people would have been appalled at the dogs and owners behaviour. but no, its a cute little fluffy dog, so its fiiine.

and when my dog and i are on walks we always have little dogs trying to attack us and the owners rarely do anything about it. we've had one big dog bark at us and it was handled incredibly well by its owner.

im just sick of the double standard and small dog owners ignoring what their dogs are doing and what their dogs are telling them.

i'd like to edit this to add that i don't hate small dogs, nor do i think they're all aggressive, and not all big dogs are sweeties. but in my experience big dogs are trained and small dogs are not. i have an issue with owners, not dogs.

editing again to address some comments.
1. why am i crying about this? cause thats basically what this sub is for, and i'm expressing my frustrations
2. yes i know small dogs can't do as much damage as big dogs, that doesn't mean that them biting is any less serious of a behavioural issue, you're kind of proving my point by treating it like that
3. my main issue is that small dogs comfort is ignored in favour of their owners laughing at them, its messed up, and i wanted to vent that. i ended up going on a bit of a tangent though lol.
4. finally, i don't hate small dogs, i'm sure they can be great, i just don't like owners who refuse to train them because they're not actually dangerous. see point 2.",11
"my daughter just nonchalantly told us she was atheist. i held in the tears until i was alone. my daughter got a new job.  it is at a fast-food restaurant. she loves her job.  she talks about it all the time and sometimes hangs out there when not working.  crazy in itself. 
the owner plays christian music all of the time and my daughter's latest story about work started with that tidbit of information.  she says that it is okay with her but she thinks it is funny because there are 7 atheists working there.  she begins to name them and count them out on her hand.  at the end of the list she just says, ""...and me.""  
i am really good at keeping a straight face.   i did this time as well.  she finished her story and i turned to my wife and asked if she heard what she said about being an atheist.  she said she did.  mind you, my daughter is still sitting there.  this is the first time she mentioned her beliefs to us.  she has visited churches with friends and even with me when she was very young and i was showing her the type of church i grew up in.  
i am so proud of her for being able to say something like that to us without feeling like she will be judged.  i am also proud of our parenting in that area.  we never pushed the issue and never let her know until much later what our beliefs are.  we let her find her way.  
i know she has some very religious friends.  she didn't let that influence her, apparently. 
my wife and i are of different views.  my wife has a bit more religion than i do.  my older daughter is very religious and quotes the christian bible often.  my extended family is very religious.  i am ... dudeist, at the moment and consider myself atheist.  
i am happy that my science-loving, intelligent, and kind daughter has chosen her path on her own.  i am happy that my older daughter has chosen her path as well.  
i think we have done a good job and it actually brought me to tears to have her speak to us as equals in her early adulthood.  
i hope i didn't ramble too much.",11

"i stopped my mom from suicide with cookies and water. i don't know if this is the right sub for this, but i have literally told no one, and the thought came back to me tonight. 

i was around 10 at the time, and i was pretty dumb. me and my sister were home alone because my dad and mom went to the bar to have some drinks. about 4 hours after they left, my mom comes home in an uber.

she storms upstairs, and is crying insanely hard. i have only seen her cry one other time, and it was about a movie.

my sister said hi to my mom, but she didn't respond because of how upset she was. my sister got mad when she didn't respond and made things even worse for her. i just looked out my door and did nothing.

when i walked into her room to ask what was happening, she was on the bed crying and responded with: ""nothing. nows not the time.""

i really could tell that there was something wrong, but the least i could do was bring her something to drink or eat

i went downstairs to the kitchen and got a cookie and some water. when i went back upstairs, and into her room, she had a nooce laying on the bed. i remember seeing it but not thinking to much of it.

i handed the water and cookies to her, and she just stopped crying for a couple of seconds. she looked at me and then looked at the snacks. she put them down and said: ""thank you ~my name~."" 

i'm almost certain that she was mad because my dad either hooked up with another girl, or was mean to her because my dad has anger issues.

i also think that she was about to attempt suicide, but just cookies and water made her stop from suiciding. 

i'm almost 14 now, and she's doing really good now. she smiles everyday and has gotten really involved in church and loves her bible study group. my dad is also doing better now, and he is learning to respect my mom more for what she is.

i like to think that her feeling when i gave her the cookies was that: ""if i left this world, i'm leaving so much behind me. people will miss me.""

"my wife always denies me sex.. and i am extremely proud of her.

we are going through somewhat of a crisis and it's killed both our sex drives. hers more than mine. 

during these difficult times, it's not often when i ask her for sex or related things...but when i do, she always answers me honestly.

i am so glad i'm with someone who takes care of themselves and doesn't give into social pressures or expectations. 

personally i would rather weather these tough times together and then have amazing sex when we both want to play :)

it takes a brave woman to commit to doing what's right for her.

when we get through this, and we inevitably will, i very much look forward to working hard to restore our intimacy together. 

because helping each other is what partners are for.",11
"my dad killed himself, and i have a message for you.. apologies if this isn't appropriate for this sub. i'm really unsure where else it would go. (sorry, on mobile)

18 years ago today, my father committed suicide, at the age of 46. 

although we knew depression ran in his family (his own mother committed suicide when he was a child), he exhibited no signs of depression, or expressed suicidal thoughts. ever. 

we had a happy life. he and my mother had been together since they were teenagers, and were truly happy. he had what seemed, everything to live for. yet, on the afternoon of february 23, 2001, my dad left a note on our screened porch, telling my mom not come outside, and hung himself in the shed behind our house. 

i've read many posts and comments here of those suffering and contemplating taking their own life. for what it's worth, and it may not be worth much, but that voice - the one that is telling you it's for the best, and your loved ones are better off? that the pain is too much to continue? that you are a burden to those around you? it's not true. i am not dismissing your feelings, i'm really not. i just want you to know, as a person on the other side of suicide, that voice is wrong. 

it may be situational — an episode in your life that seems hopeless. or maybe you've suffered with depression and these thoughts for years, and you just want it to stop. so you make the decision. you plan, and you are finally at peace because you know the end is near. that's one part people don't understand. how could someone go about their lives as if everything was ok? ""they were happy! it doesn't make sense!"" ""they finally seemed to be ok!"" 

but think about it. when you have what seems to be an impossible problem, how do you feel and act when you finally find a solution? you feel relieved. calm. sometimes even euphoric. 

i can only imagine the pain my father was going through to have chosen to leave us in such a way. but the days leading up to his death, he seemed so happy. the day of, he and my mom went to lunch, spoke of plans about moving down south to be closer to my sister and i, and even spoke of plans that evening to have dinner with friends. 

i was 22 when he died. i was so angry right after. we all were. how could a man with so much to live for, who had such a wonderful life, choose to kill himself? we were totally blindsided, and thought what a selfish, deplorable thing he did. 

how wrong i was. 

since then, after research, talking with suicide survivors, and those who have lost loved ones, plus suffering from my own depression, i now know it isn't selfish. to the sufferer, it's selfless. sufferers are totally convinced their absence from this earth will be a relief for those who love them. one less burden. the feelings are real, and they are persistent. 

i'm not sure what i'm trying to say. i guess i'm talking to both sides. if you've lost someone to suicide, try not to be angry. it'll be hard, trust me, i know. but after 18 years, i'm not angry. i'm just so fucking sad. sad he had to suffer in silence. sad he'll never know his grandkids, or see what my sister had i have accomplished. sad my mom still cries for him and misses him everyday. sad i can't get his advice or hear his corny jokes when i'm down. 

i'm writing this to you. 

you are loved. you are worth it. you will be so very missed. this pain is real. but it doesn't have to be permanent. reach out. talk. share. there is no shame. 

the voices are temporary. they can be silenced, and there is help. 



edit: i am reading every one of your comments. i am overwhelmed, and so grateful to those of you that shared your own suffering, and those with loved ones lost to suicide. you are all stronger than you know. if any of you need to talk, feel free to message me:) 

thank you for the silver and gold:) very appreciated. ",11
"two years of job searching. i've been looking for a fulltime job for 2 years now. i've gotten so many rejection letters i lost count. i've worked some shitty retail jobs, been fired from one, and been so depressed i didnt feel like i could push through it or make it. i lost 20lbs (and i'm already really skinny) cause i couldnt afford to eat a lot. but today i got a job. a real job in my field. it's literally so much more than i've ever made. it's been the hardest 2 years of my life and it turned around in a day. i'm still in shock and i cant believe it. this literally changed my life over night and idk even, i'm just really emotional and happy today.

"i just realised that i was slowly being a creep. so i've just deleted 3410 porn videos & photos, deleted my porn related reddit and tumblr accounts and as from 2019 am going out to meet new people. i don't want to be a virgin volcel anymore. yeah...i had 3410 porn videos and images saved on my phone. the thing is, at some point i masturbated so much that i didn't even realised that porn took so much place in my life. 

the reason why i was so much in porn is because i was frustrated. i live in one of those shitty village where there's nothing to do and where people aren't that handsome according to me. i've always dreamed to live in one of those big cities, near the beach and with skyscrapers, where i would go out at a the skatepark with friends after school or have different kind of girls that maybe i could date. but hey...if there's nothing fun to do outside and that the only way to release your sexual urges on beautiful girls, is to masturbate online, why would i leave the house ?

so i masturbated and gave zero intention to get in a relationship with girls more than friendship (that's why am a 18 year old voluntary celibate). 

the creepy part of that story is that among those pictures and videos, i had a ""collection"" of approximately 1500 pictures of instagram girls that shows their ass in bikini thongs. i don't mean instagram **models** but instagram **users**, who are college students of my age or older who doesn't really post these pictures as fap material. i literally created an album for each, with their names in my phone and didn't find anything wrong with that. it's only yesterday night that i realised how fucked up i was getting.

as from 2019, am moving to one of those states of my dream for further studies and fuck this old creepy me, am a new and better person now.",11

"i was just kissed for the first time!. i'm in my twenties and had my marriage was cut short after 2 years when i found out my wife was seeing other guys. honestly, i am really doing fine, and i was/am taking things one day at a time. after a bit, an old friend from college started talking to me.

she hurt her leg pretty badly and can't drive, and one day i offered to take her home from college since her rides bailed or something. i won't bore you with all the details (as much as i'd like to), but we wound up having a little impromptu date at a wine garden on the way back. finally, we get to her house, just sitting in my jeep talking about life. there is a pause in the conversation when a cat jumps on my hood. i look over and laugh and she kisses me. she is holding my face, and i'm a little shocked. i had no idea that was even on the table; so, i kind of pull back in surprise. and she just leans forward and kisses me again... it was amazing. after all the drama of a divorce, this moment really makes that bitter pill seem not so nasty. 

i know it sounds so cheesy, but i have always been the initiator of the first kiss in every relationship i have been in. this is the first time someone has kissed me; i guess the title is a bit misleading. i really needed to say something to someone. thanks reddit.

"i have a year clean from heroin today.. it just feels like a regular day, honestly. i didn't want to use yesterday, or the day before. i don't want to use today. that dark chapter of my life is over, and i'm incredibly grateful for that.

only one person in my life knows that this is my real clean date, and i owe so much of this to him being there when i was at my absolute worst, on the verge of death. i couldn't have done it without him. he's my best friend, and i'm very, very fortunate to have him in my life. he always tells me how lucky i am, seeing as i'm alive after multiple overdoses. he's right. i am lucky. 

it's also my mom's birthday today. i couldn't have done it without her, either. i hope she likes the fancy alexa we got her. it's got like, a display screen that shows you the weather and stuff? i dunno, it looks neat. she asked for the most basic version, but she definitely deserves the nicest one, so that's the one she's getting.

like i said, it's just another day, really. i'm gonna do boring stuff like go to the gym and get my car's oil changed. the difference between yesterday and today is pretty much imperceptible. but somewhere in the last year, i've started becoming a pretty different person. the kind of person i actually like, maybe. it's still a work in progress. i guess it always should be, though, shouldn't it?

anyway, these are just some thoughts i wanted to put down. i could say more, but the take-away is that i'm just grateful. i could be dead right now. it's a wonder that i'm not. and though i'm not perfectly happy with my life, i am so thankful i didn't die. i'm so thankful for the people i've had in my life that have helped me to keep living and be a better person than i've been.

"my grandmother literally paid me simply for visiting her. my grandma is in her 70s and does have a husband but he is away alot (he plays golf constantly and is also a mason and has family in england and america while we live in scotland). i'm usually the one he calls upon to check up on my grandma which i would usually do anyway when he's away since she is too frail to walk her black lab herself.
one such day was yesterday, my step grandad left early in the morning and wouldn't be back until 4 the next morning so i went up for a few hours to keep her company. on the way i bought her a cake from the bakers so we could have lunch together. she was so happy to see me and we walked the dog together since she wanted to go for a walk.
as i left she stuffed a 20 into my pocket just because i had visited her. i did not expect money and outright refused to take it, her excuse was that i bought her a cake. a small cake. from the bakers. it was a couple of pounds not 20.

it really puts into perspective how lonely elderly people can be and although she has the dog to keep her company she must crave human attention. i ended up going back later that night to walk the dog again for her and i won't forget the smile on her face as i unexpectedly walked through her door.

love you grandma

edit: i just wanted to say how happy i am about all the love! i also want to give my condolences to those who have lost their grandparents, i can't go through all the comments giving my condolences. thanks to those who commented with loving words, hopefully this post and you beautiful redditers made somebodies day :) ",11
"so i got pulled over by a cop the other day.... i wasn't wearing my seat belt. he pulled me over and informed me that i was being written a ticket for a seat belt violation. he asked me to get my information out of my passenger door because the driver's side was bordering the road. 

when i was digging in my glove box, he noticed my bag of pipe tobacco. he asked what it was, and i told him it was flavored pipe tobacco, and we had a short and friendly conversation about that. he then asked if i had anything illegal in my truck. i told him no, and gave him free reign to search my vehicle, to which he declined. 

after i handed him my registration, he was patient while i loaded my insurance app, and then he noticed that i had recently moved, and my insurance/license addresses were different. he told me that is a citable violation, and i should get it changed immediately. however, he did not issue that violation. 

while writing the ticket he asked where i work, and what time i had to be there. after i had answered, he responded ""i'll try to get you out of here as soon as possible.""

no drama here. no interesting story. no abuse of the law. just a story about a polite and friendly police officer doing his job. i figured with all of the negative stories out there, i would share a good experience. i really think people forget that cops are people too - most of them good people.

"it sucks not having that person to talk to anymore. when you see something you both enjoyed and you want to show them but you can't. new music, tv shows, jokes.. life's pretty shit for me right now. i don't know what to do. i haven't been able to eat properly in days, and i miss her. i removed all of her friends on social media because i don't want to see her with another guy. i'm so lost, and so scared. i just want to fast forward and get out of this hellhole. please help me.

edit: thank you all for the kind words. i haven't been able to read them all atm, i'm in the hospital with my friend for unrelated reasons, but i've skimmed through them briefly. you're all so kind.

edit2: god, i haven't had time to read all of those. but thank you, soooo much. for the two gold as well. everyone has gone through something like this, and i hope the best for you all. ❤️",11
"my mother and sister had a car crash. my mother died, while my sister survived with a brain injury. how to continue?. tl;dr at the bottom.

&#x200b;

my family owes two bakeries, about 60 kilometres from each other, so we kinda split up - me (27) and my sister (23) managed the one in the smaller town, while my father (53), mother (46), other sister (25) and brother (21) managed the one in the big city. on november 18th, my mother and sister came to visit us, like they did most  sundays. my mother woke me up but i didn't get up right away - i had been drinking the previous night because it was my friend's birthday and was really hungover. after a while, i managed to get up and hang out with my mom for a while, but i was just waiting for them to leave because i really wanted to get back to bed. i am probably never going to drink again.

around 12:05pm they decided to take off. before going, my mother started to scold me like she always did - ""you need to get married, you're 27 years old, i want grandchildren!"". i just laughed and shrugged ""you're not even 47 yet, where's the rush?"". i got up, hugged her and kissed her, said goodbye and went back to sleep, not realising that that was the last time i will ever talk to her. i remember my last thought before falling asleep was ""what if they have an accident?""

&#x200b;

it happened about 35 minutes later. they were 15 minutes from home. we still don't know what really happened, only that my sister was driving and my mother was asleep. if she had been awake, she would have probably survived with some minor injuries, maybe a concussion. but it didn't go that way.

we found out about an hour and a half after it happened. my father called to ask if they had left our place. that was the first alarm. i tried to call them both, but no one answered. took a look at the different communication apps we used - they weren't online since they left. that was the second alarm. tried to call them one more time, still no answer. i'm panicking. i open up a news site, but there's nothing on it. i open up another one and i see a picture. a picture of our car. title: car crash - one dead, one with heavy injuries. 

i got a friend of mine to drive me and my sister to the hospital where they took my other sister because i was physically and psychologically unfit to drive. it was the first in a really long series of terribly agonising rides. we still didn't know who died and who survived. i will probably always hate myself for wishing at that moment that it was mom that made it, even though i knew that her's and dad's remaining life would probably be hell. but mom died on the spot. 

if only she hand't been sleeping. if only they hadn't drop by. if only they had taken dad's car with all the extra security measures. if only i hadn't been hungover and told them to stay a bit longer. if only.

&#x200b;

my sister had a hematoma and they had to preform brain surgery. she also broke her left elbow, right wrist and a couple of fingers on her right hand, but nothing too serious. the brain surgery went extremely well and she was put into an induced coma for three days. she woke up the next day, which was a really good sign and remained in intensive care for the next two weeks, before being transfered to post-intensive neurological care, which she is finally leaving tomorrow.

she's coming home for a week or two before her physical and psychological rehabilitation starts. she is currently really depressed after staying for so long at the hospital and having such a mess in her head. the biggest problem though? she still doesn't know mom died. a few days ago, i asked her if she remembered all the people that came to visit her. one of the people she mentioned was mom, which got me a bit. she probably didn't remember that well, but she just assumed that mom would come by. we are all scared to death because we don't know how will that information affect her psychological health and that it will depress her even further. and the time for telling her is almost upon us - in a maximum of 10 hours, she will be home and she will notice that someone is missing. it's gonna be hard. it's gonna be painful.

&#x200b;

i really miss my mom. i cry almost every night when i drive back home and all i can think about is her. i miss her hugs, i miss talking to her. i miss her scolding me. i miss telling her every night how much money we made that day and i miss her calling me in the morning to ask me if i'm awake. i miss her voice. i can't look at her pictures and i hate myself for it. but the worst thing is thinking about the future that doesn't include her. i think about all the possible good things that might happen in life - all the business successes, our family growing - and she isn't there to share our joy. i see old couples walking on the streets and feel sad that she never got the chance to grow old. i expected her to live for at least 30 more years. hell, sometimes i thought she will outlive me. 

life is cruel - it makes you work really hard, put in your blood, sweat and tears for the good things, but it only takes a single moment for everything to fall to pieces. just a couple of weeks earlier, i was telling a friend of mine that i finally felt satisfied with my life. business was good, i finally payed off a loan, i was healthier than ever and everyone was in a really good mood. i wonder why the hell i even said anything. now the only thing stopping me from killing myself is not wanting to hurt my family even more. they just don't deserver to have to deal with another tragedy.

every night, when i go to sleep, i pray i somehow manage to turn back time. i wish to relive that morning and try to change things. and every morning i wake up disappointed that i failed. i might start wishing a meteor hits us so this suffering ends.

&#x200b;

i wish i was more religious and that i believed in some form of afterlife - an afterlife where i will get the chance to see my mother again, tell her about all the stuff she missed out on, and one day introduce her to all of her grandchildren. but every inch of my body tells me that that's not how it works and that that day was truly her end. every single cell tells me that life is just a series of infuriatingly tragic moments that ends with an endless darkness and silence. if we're lucky enough, our body will overload with all the different happiness hormones so our brain manages to give us the happiest thoughts right before we go back nothingness. 

but god do i hope i'm wrong.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

tl;dr

 \- mom died in car crash

 \- sister still doesn't know because she suffered brain injury, even though it's been more than a month since it happened

 \- life sucks

 \- i want to die but can't because it would crush the rest of the family even more

 \- i wish i believed there was an afterlife, but i don't

 \- please someone give me a time machine or arrange a meeting with someone that will buy my soul in exchange for reverting all of this

&#x200b;

sorry for the inconsistent rambling, i just don't have the strength and knowledge to try and write it somewhat better.

sorry for all the writing mistakes, english is not my native language.

sorry if i don't reply right away, i need to go to sleep now because it's getting pretty late and have to get my sister out of the hospital tomorrow.

"i attempted suicide. about 3 weeks ago i attempted suicide. i had hung my belt up around my over the door coat rack. i'm a pretty heavy set guy and i didn't think it through. i stood on my chair and tied the belt around my neck. i pushed the chair away and started to hang. i lost consciousness pretty quickly and i saw my life flash before my eyes. i woke up in hospital a few hours later. the knot i tied wasn't tight enough and came loose because of my body weight. apparently the noise of my unconscious body hitting the hard wood floor was enough to wake up my cousin on the other side of the house. she performed cpr and called paramedics. the amount of people and flowers and the overall support brought me to tears. it ultimately brought my disjointed family together to openly talk about our mental health issues. it was an unfortunate situation that brought up some much needed conversations. please if you're suicidal really think about the side affects before attempting to go through with it. 


edit: wow. the support is incredible thank you. firstly i'm doing alot better mentally. ",11
"i rocked your son to sleep tonight because you're not here.. you chose and continue to choose a life of partying, alcohol, and your constant rotation of new boyfriends over your son. it's been 4 months since we got custody and you've only tried to see him twice. you schedule park visits and stand him up. you break his heart with each phone call and i have to mend it. his dad works away for 2 weeks and all he has is me. he asks about you every day. he wonders when he will see you. how do i tell him he won't? his 4 year old mind can't comprehend why his mama doesn't want him. i celebrate his victories, i teach him respect and discipline, i pray with him and give him all the love i can muster up for a child i didn't make or even know for the first 2 years of his life. i pack his lunches and put little drawings in them so he feels special, i make sure he's fed, clean and happy. because you don't. because you won't. 

tonight you finally called, but you had to cut it short because you were eating with your new ""boo"" as you call him. so i rocked him to sleep while he cried for you. 

because you won't.

edit: i just want to say thank you to each and every person who has taken time to read this post, give me advice, share their wisdom and experience, and even give me an award. at times, i feel so alone on this journey. it's a wonderful feeling to know there are people out there, all around the world, that are willing to take a few minutes to acknowledge what i'm going through. i feel even more confident in my new role and encouraged to be the best that i can be for this little guy. 

thank you all!

edit 2: i wish i could go through and thank all of you individually but i got overwhelmed! just know that i've read and continue to read each of your posts and i've upvoted them as a thank you. i'll probably read them multiple times as they've brought me an incredible amount of comfort. all of your kind words have inspired me and helped me to see the silver lining in such a traumatic situation.",11
"i'm a guy, and wearing panties has gotten me to exercise. i suppose i wanted to talk about this, make sense of it.  i'm a guy, tall and slender with what you'd call an effeminate build.  i never had chest hair although my legs are hairy.  i never much liked my body.  i have no upper body definition and always thought of myself as scrawny: when i pull in my stomach you can see my ribs.  any exercise i got was coincidental in going throughout my day: walking and bicycling.  i tried to go to the gym in the past and do deadlifts and such, trying to get the big biceps and pecs and such.  but i never really liked my body enough to keep with it.  trying to turn \*this\* into gaston from beauty & the beast was never a convincing goal.

&#x200b;

so, just recently, both out of curiosity and for an illicit thrill, i got myself some panties from victoria's secret.  they're the tight kind of cheekies with a seam up the back.  and i looked at myself and i thought: wow, i kind of have a nice butt.  i...kind of like the way i look in them.  i always wore baggy trousers and baggy boxers.  but i actually think i look good in tightly contoured underwear.  for the first time i thought i looked kind of sexy in the mirror, not flabby but really nicely slender but contoured.

&#x200b;

and this actually got me excited to do real exercise.  i've started to do crunches and twists to get my stomach flatter so i look even nicer in the mirror.  i've started to jog a mile at a time for the first time in years.  and yes, i still do get the illicit thrill of wearing panties, but it makes me feel like i can be secretly sexy in a kind of way.  something must be right with my body if i can wear size small cheekies out of the house and not have them feel very constricting.  and the feeling is more like pride than active arousal.  who knows, maybe having this kind of body isn't as bad as i thought.  i actually want to make it better now.

&#x200b;

edit: i just want to say how wonderfully overwhelmed i am by everyone's heartwarming responses!  i wasn't sure how this would be received, but i couldn't have asked for anything better.  thank you so much to everyone with their encouraging words, now i am definitely going to keep up my regimen and not feel ashamed about it!",11
"i am an er nurse. i saw a mother kiss her grown child three times on her face before she said her final good bye.. we spent an an hour and forty five minutes trying to bring her back. it wasn't the normal code (cardiac arrest). 

she was a young adult, although, with an extensive medical history where she is total care (tracheostomy and various other issues). 

her mom took care of her for over 3 decades. her mom kissed her goodbye and she yelled ""how am i supposed to live without you?"". 

the patient next door, a mere few feet away, with only a curtain between them, began hysterically crying. i tried to console him too but that wasn't easy as my eyes were full of tears.

they are still full of tears. 

i hope she's resting peacefully. and i hope her mom eventually finds solace. ",11
"i can get an abortion if i want.. it's my body . it's my choice.  the same goes for any woman. what we decide to do with our bodies is not up to you. 

i don't care what anyone says. you cannot change my mind. **i won't budge.**

if you have ever gotten an abortion just know you have my support. if you have ever had a baby know you have my support. if you decided to give your baby up for adoption you have my support. 

i'm pro choice. not anti life. 

edit: 283848383. a lot of people assumed one thing or another about the why of my post and the background of myself or even hypothetical questions about the nonexistent man who fathered my nonexistent child, and everything else in between. all of which were irrelevant, that's not at all what this is about. 

i made this post to show my support to **all** women who have made or will make a decision regarding **their own** bodies when it comes to making babies. your opinion is not and will not ever be needed. 

**to all of you who need it please know i stand by you and your decision. whether it be abortion, adoption, or motherhood.** 

i am in no way shape or form trying to say that abortion is a ""birth control method"".  also, just so you know birth control, condoms, vasectomies, & tubal ligation are not 100% effective .. unwanted pregnancies happen in all kinds of ways. 

i hope the amount of backlash i received is an obvious answer as to why this was an offmychest.

"im actually so fucking happy. i made the best decision in the world 4 months ago and moved in with 4 of my mates. it's the best living situation i've ever had we all hang out in the evenings like a little community and catch up on our day, my social anxiety and depression have reduced, i'm no longer in debt and i'm arranging to move to a new city next year, to study my passion, photography. i'm getting out into the dating scene and it's going well. from someone who suffered severe depression i genuinely didn't know this is what happiness would be like.i look in the mirror every day and i'm slowly starting to like the person i'm becoming.

update: thank you guys so much for all the nice comments, really enjoying reading them. i thought i'd give some more detail since this is garnering attention. about 2 years ago my depression got so bad that i refused to leave the house and clean my room or do anything. i'd go months without cleaning and not seeing anyone. after a while i decided to make a change, things were so bad that i'd promise to clean and then just not have the will to follow up. i started forcing myself to clean everyday and set routines and goals, since that point i've promised to make the right decision with whatever life throws at me, if the dishes are needing done i forced myself to do them no matter what. i got a job as a bartender, i was so socially anxious that i couldn't talk to customers. every day i was forced to make small talk with people thanks to my job, i sucked at first and things were awkward but i started getting better and better. i've worked there for a year now and i'm easily able to banter with customers and coworkers, i also had to chat to dozens of women every day and it really helped me be comfortable around women. now today i can chat to anyone with no issues now, i'm totally comfortable around women and have been going on more dates than ever. i'm doing well financially and everything's good. best of luck with your journey, cheers.",11
"i miss my mom. i walked down to get my mail today and opened my mailbox to find a card from my older sister. i never get snail mail, especially from family members (with the exception of bdays). i started to open the envelope while walking back up to my apartment. when i opened it and i realized the letter was signed ""love always, mom"" i immediately dropped to the ground. my mom passed away 5 years ago. ive been having a really hard time transitioning into adult life (i'm 19 and living on my own for the first time, working to make money for school) and my sister decided to send me a letter that my mom had written her when she was my age and struggling with similar issues. the letter is so uplifting and so my mom. i'm just feeling a lot of emotions right now. i'm so thankful my sister sent me that and that i got to open something from my mom. i never thought i'd get something with her name on it again.
sorry for errors i typed this through watery eyes hahaha

edit: wow! you all have no idea how much your kind words mean to me. i'm so overwhelmed and feel so loved, you all moved me to tears. i wish you all nothing but the best. hug your families tight for me❤️❤️ and as for those of you that have gone through similar things, you're not alone either!",11
"why won't people use oxford commas? cut my brain some goddamn slack.. the lack of oxford (or serial) commas is really getting to me.  it wasn't much of a problem before, as most texts kindly include that damn thing.  but as i tackle more and more text, i'm starting to notice how most of them are missing the comma, and it negatively affects reading.  as a random example, when i read something like ""...the shirt comes in a variety of colors, which includes purple, green, red and blue..."", my brain goes: ok well there's purple shirts, green shirts, and... red and blue shirts? oh, wait.  it's red shirts and blue shirts.  two separate selections, not a shirt of two colors.  

the lack of it is everywhere, from my art history textbook to my online driver's ed course.  please, for the love of god, use oxford commas even though it's not required in some formats!!

tldr: personally i think oxford/serial commas are helpful but no one uses them anymore and it pisses me off

"i know this is really small but for the first time in almost 2 months i went to the gym. i've been working so fucking much this entire summer and eventually i just stopped doing the things i enjoy. i fell back into that dark place i worked so hard to get out of. i stopped hanging out with friends, and i eventually stopped working out and doing stuff i enjoy.

after a recent kinda traumatic incident it gave me a reality check. i sat in my room for a week straight just crying and playing minecraft alone. i saw the true colors of what i used to call my friends. i saw how i was wasting my life and letting it happen.

it's been 2 weeks since i dropped almost all my shitty friends, which also happened to be my closest friends. well 2 days i rewrote all my goals and went to the gym. i know it's kinda insignificant but i had no one to really share with and after i type this out i'm gonna get out of bed and get ready to go again. i also hit up an old friend and asked if he wanted to hang out today.

hopefully all these improvements (i have a few other goals i'm trying to pursue also) work and i end up being a little more happy :)

"austin, honey, go f—k yourself.. hi, austin. you are legally separated from your wife. she is dating. in fact, she is dating the man she was fucking while you were deployed to a war zone. isn't that usually how it works out? she's dating the man who momentarily broke up with her, which caused her so much distress, she tried to commit suicide in front of your kids and forced you to come home from a mission early. 

maybe i shouldn't have gotten involved with you before the ink settled on your divorce papers. but hey: you two are separated. divorces can take a while. especially in the military.  plus, i'd never have sex with someone who was married, technically or not. you and i were flirting. nothing harmful. we were getting to know each other so when you fully and finally divorced, we could figure out if dating was an option or not. 

maybe that says more about me than you. but i'd like to think i have a strong moral compass. i don't cheat or condone cheating, but hey: you signed papers of separation, started the divorce proceedings and lived apart. is it really cheating if you're in the process of getting divorced? it's breaking up + a legal component. but for all intents and purposes, you both acted and were single. you were broken up. a court hearing and a piece of paper were all that were keeping you two legally together. 

here is what i need to say, but i won't say it to you because, well, fuck you. your choice will fuck you up more than my words could. 

the first time, she went psychotic on you, and out of fear of losing your kids, you ghosted me and tried to make it work with her. i get that. you knew that if you didn't play the game, you'd lose the only sources of joy and love in your life. the first time, we were just friends. you cut me out because you were afraid of her construing our friendship as something more. 

but you came back. you came back begging me to give you a real chance. you told me you were done and choosing her over yourself and the potential for anything with me was a big mistake. you called her every name in the book. you took more steps to divorce her this time than last. as a friend, i knew you were serious. so as a potential partner, i allowed the flirting to begin. 

last night, you went back. 

you went back to a woman who won't help you raise your kids. you went back to threats. you went back to someone who has no ambition. you went back to someone who won't even get her ged. you went back to someone who was verbally asking you to come back, while, at the same time, texting another dude to set up a time to fuck later that night. you went back to someone who gets drunk downtown over taking care of her children. you went back to someone who has had you arrested out of spite. you went back to someone who spends your money on bullshit but can't afford her own bills. you went back to someone mentally unstable when she doesn't get her way. you went back to someone who only wants to stay married because she won't get a real job, therefore she is unable to support herself with rent, groceries or a car payment — in other words, a leech. or in military speak: a dependapotamous. a term i learned from you, by the way. 

so, this time, instead of wondering why i wasn't good enough or what i'd done wrong, i woke up early, got a good workout in, got my favorite coffee, got my nails done, ordered chanel makeup (i just love seeing the box come in the mail), bought a new dress from neiman marcus, got dressed to the 9's and went out for cocktails with my best bad ass ladies and celebrated international women's day. 

you missed out on a hard working attorney who would never dream (or need) to depend on you for money. you missed out on someone who wanted to help you grow. you missed out on someone with ambitions and goals and an education. the only baggage i'd have brought was my student loans, which i wouldn't depend on you to pay. you missed out on a whole lotta love, respect, and stability. 

and i dodged a motherfucking bullet. good luck fucking crazy and lazy for the next 14 years till your kids are grown and gone. i have court cases to win and people to help. you, thankfully, won't be one of them. 

thank you, next. ",11
"i'm black. i'm not apologizing for that.. i'm a black man. i'm about 6'2"", average build. nothing too fancy. i think i look normal, not intimidating in the slightest. i grew up in a middle-class neighborhood. my parents were blue collar workers, but provided for me and my sister. we were taught manners, said our pleasantries. i got detention once in fifth grade because i was late to class because i spilled paint in my art class and had to clean it up. but that's it, that's the worst trouble i've ever been in in my life. 

i am a surgical resident at a hospital you've probably heard of. i was educated in a top 10 university and went to medical school at a pseudo-ivy league institution. i have had a great life. i've made sure of it. so have my parents. 

of course, i have noticed racism throughout my life. i have been pulled over and the officer has never given me a clear answer. sometimes, they will straight up lie and tell me that i was speeding when i know i wasn't. once, i was stopped and frisked. the officer apologized and told me that i matched the description of a criminal-on-the-run in the area. the only description was ""black man, average build."" i never reported this, but i always remember it. 

today, i was leaving after a 26-hour shift at the hospital. i'm in my fourth year of residency and the hours get longer and longer, but i'm almost done. today was particularly grueling, because i found out that a patient i have worked with since the start of my residency is now deemed 'terminal' and will be moved to hospice care. it sucked, it broke my heart. it was like four years' worth of work had been erased. 

as i was walking across the parking lot, a young man—younger than me, maybe twenty-five—leaned out of his car and called me the n-word. it was loud enough so people could hear. people stared, most in shock. others picked up the pace to get away from the earth-shattering embarrassment unfolding. 

i stopped and looked at him. the man didn't get out of his car, but he made sure i saw him. the sneer on his face, it grew into a piercing grin. he started mimicking the sounds of a monkey. he called me the n-word again. people continued to stare. my mouth fell open. the guy mocked my expression; he feigned behavior like one of my patients suffering from severe mental retardation. he was trying to show me how he saw me. 

a lot of things were on my mind in the forty-five odd seconds i was standing there. i wanted to walk up to the man and list off all my accomplishments. i wanted to tell him how, in eleventh grade, i won a science fair by creating a more efficient way for our school's agriculture club to conserve energy. it took me to a national conference. 

i wanted to tell him about the first time i fell in love. i wanted to tell him about the guy who made my heart beat so fast that i thought it would explode. this guy, he was tall, his smile was dopey and his eyes were light. just the thought of him took away the painful feelings that this man was bringing to me. 

i wanted to tell him that i'm a good person; that i volunteer, i save lives, i work so people like you get a chance to survive and carry on being the hateful people you are. 

but instead, i walked to my car. the man called me the n-word about five more times, laughing so hard i thought it was certain he would lose consciousness. 

i sat behind the wheel for a very long time, maybe ten minutes, processing. i was angry at the man, but also at the people that didn't say anything. i was angry at myself for not saying anything. 

sometimes, i just feel alone. who i am, simply the color of my skin, makes me the target of hate from people that i will never even know. i truly try to love and understand everyone, so when one person returns that with malice and ill-will, it's a lot to take in. 

i don't think anyone will read this, but i just wanted to tell you all about my day. i want to put this out into the world. i want to let the internet know that black people are good. black people are strong, capable, smart. black people are resilient. i'm proud of my blackness. i'm proud of my coarse hair and thick lips. i'm proud of my body that is subject to ridicule. i am proud of who i am, what i have been through. i am proud of my ancestors who were slaves and now i am their wildest dream. 

black people can be bad, too. black people can be murderers and thieves and rapists. black people can be everything—except human, apparently. i just want to be acknowledged as a human. i want to be seen as a human. i want to be known. 

i love my black body. i'm tired of having to explain that pride in my black body is not hatred for any other race. i'm tired of worrying that i may be shot driving to work. 

i don't hate police. i don't hate white people. i don't hate anyone. 

but, god, i love me. and i want that to be enough. ",11

a shout out to my boyfriend. he doesn't get enough credit for anything. we lived together for awhile and i used to substitute at a local school and i am not a morning person. so he would get up early and make my lunch so that i would have enough to eat. and we found out i am pregnant and he left the decision to me about whether or not to keep it because he respected that it was my body. i passed out at work like a week later due the pregnancy and he took me back home and took such great care of me. and now we live 2 hours apart and we are trying to make things work out to get him moved up here before the baby is born. and i just feel like he doesn't get enough credit for how amazing of a guy he is. yeah he has a few issues and made a few mistakes. who hasn't? we're all human. but he's using those to try his hardest to become better and i'm just so proud of him. ,11
"update on my husband is dying of kidney failure.. you were all so lovely, just to say my beloved husband died in my arms on october 4th. 
given the three expected endings ,,( heart attack, drowning in fluid or drifting off)we were blessed that he drifted. 
he shocked us by announcing vehemently on the thursday 4th that he had ( swear swear) had enough of feeling like (swear swear).....he meant it! 
his mum and i gave him permission, loved on him even more and held him...
he raised his thumb, and being held and loved, like he always has been but especially in the last year... he literally drifted.  i cannot wish him back, because i adore him and he deserves the break...but by cripes i wish i could have the healthy years again. anyway this is just to thank you for the loving thoughts you sent and to send beloved on his way for his "" long drive"". xxx",11
"fuck everyone who calls kids with cancer warriors and superheroes. i want to punch people in the face who tell me my baby is a ""superhero"" and ""he's such a warrior! he's so brave!""

you know what? my 5yo isn't a superhero. he isn't a brave warrior up against a faceless enemy, destined to win glory and fame.

he's a 5yo child who is scared every day we're in the hospital. he cries with every new (and old) procedure and just wants to go home. every day we're inpatient and he gets toxic chemicals pumped into his tiny body, he goes to sleep leaking sad tears that he's not sleeping in his own bed.

fuck you and your stupid idea that cancer is some glorified battle. he's not a superhero, he's a goddamn victim. take your stupid meaningless words that you throw out to make yourself feel better and shove them up your ass.",11
"as a former helicopter parent and current mother of a 23 suicidal son, please take my advice. do not smother your kids, do not try to mold them to be the perfect child. let them be independent and take risks.. i wanted the best for my son, so i scheduled his entire life. i grew up around 3 brothers, who spent their teenage years in the 80s drinking, doing drugs, partying, fucking girls. they slacked off, and i hated it. i hated their attitude towards life, i hated them for how unproductive they were. i wanted my son to be nothing like them. i had this image of my son being this smart, witty hipster kid who, on his own accord, said no to partying and drugs because *he was better than that.* i saw what the stereotypes of kids today were, and i was happy to see him grow up in this generation, which seemed to be more accepting. 

except, around 13-14, things changed. i saw him hang out with different kids. i found out he cut his after school art class, i found him kissing a girl at 13, he wanted different clothing, he started listening to hip-hop. my dream of a smart hipster accepting kid was fading away, and my reaction was to smother him. no hanging out after school, i have to talk to his friends parents always if he is going to see friends, i have to make sure his friends are the 'right type' to be hanging out with. it got to the point where i told him he cant listen to certain music because it was too crude or had curses in it. no violent movies. no over sexualized movies. i picked out his clothing, i told him he cant wear his more 'edgy' clothing. no hanging out in the park, no hanging out on the streets at all. no going to parties unless there are parents there. no violent video games. no going to the sketchy bodega. i tried at one point to make him eat vegan and organic food only. i made him read books i picked out for him, feminist books mostly. 

i did everything in my power to make sure he was the right type of person. i didn't want him to have fun, i didn't let him choose his own time. because he would have chosen the wrong things, and fun usually just means up to no good right? so i didn't like the idea of him having fun, as many excuses as i made, that was it. fun to a teen boy, to me, was getting drunk at a party and doing something you will regret. not my kid. 

i tried molding him, and in the end, he became sheltered from the world entirely. at 17 he was going off to college, and we spent 2 weeks at my sisters house. those 2 weeks were just so eye opening to me. my sisters kids were 16 and 17 and they just seemed so much more mature, so much more socially healthy than my son. they had a lot of friends, they had girlfriends. the parents looked the other way to the older son drinking a few beers with friends. the kids listened to whatever they wanted, they watched whatever movies they wanted, they hung out with whoever. the older son had a public enemy shirt on, something i would have disproved of for my son. but he was... just so much more mature. 

my son went to college for 9 weeks, then dropped out. he came home, telling me college was too overwhelming. he became depressed. i still tried to withhold him from bad influences, but after some eye opening events i realized how wrong this was. and i also realized it was too late. he was 18 years old with the maturity and life-exposure level of a 12 year old. i got him to move out at 20, with my help, to an apartment only 4 blocks away. 

i wish i could say he has done better. it has been 5 years, 7 suicide attempts, no friends, no girlfriends. i give him 400 bucks a month for his apartment. he doesnt blame me, but i blame myself. i really fucking do. 

let your child be themselves. let them take risks. if they fuck up in some way, if you catch them drinking with friends at 17, learn to look the other way sometimes. they dont have to be perfect, but they have to be themselves. i never learned this. i wish i fucking did when i had him.

"if you're mixed, you're a white guy just as much as you are a black guy.. i'm a ""light skin black guy."" my mom is greek. my dad is black. like, really black. i'm light skin with the hair of a black man and the nose of a greek man. i know, it's confusing.

pretty much, i always get that i'm black. i always always always get told i'm a light skin black guy. i'm light skin, i'm black. blah blah blah.

the other day someone asked me what i was, because they've never seen a light skin black guy i guess. i told them 'oh i'm a dark skin white guy.' and she laughed, but i was dead fucking serious.

i'm white just as much as i am black. i'm not a light skin black guy, or a dark skin white guy, i'm mixed. i'm mixed race.. aka black and white. 

most of my friends are black and the other day i said to them that i'm also a white guy yk. they all told me to shut my ass up and i was like why the fuck should i??? dude i'm also 50% white. what the fuck? it's literally half of my gene. i'm half black and half white. mixed race. fucking hell.

"i'm not grieving over this. our nephew \my ex-husband and i\ just passed away yesterday.  he was flying down the road at somewhere between 80-100 miles an hour last wednesday when he hit the curve 1/4 mile up from me and hit an 18 wheeler.  car went *under* the truck.  they airlifted him to nearest large city and after 5 days, it was a wrap.

what aggravates me is the outpouring of 'omg we miss you what a wonderful person you were'!

this nephew spent so much time bullying both of my kids, and a lot of other neighborhood kids, and nobody did anything about it or laughed it off.  he was into too many of the wrong things and his mom enabled him \even when he got her house burned down - the wrong people were looking for him there and they robbed the place and then set it on fire\ and he was amazingly disrespectful to people right to the end but somehow i'm expected to join the social media  sympathy train?  no, no and fuck no.  

i always said to myself that he was going to do something really stupid and then he'd finally catch on and see the light.  nobody told him to go flying down the road at too fast.  nobody deserves to die, but the luck on him making bad decisions ran out and i'm not sad about it.  and i don't see why i should be.  i am sad that a mother lost her son.  i am sad that my son's best friend lost his brother who - after all of that - *idolized* him.  but i'm not sad he's gone.  you play stupid games you win stupid prizes.  i'm mostly mad at myself because i like to think i don't hold that much animosity in my heart towards anyone, but there it is.

update: it's been 24 hours since i posted.  i've had time to give this (and your responses) thought.  i'm still angry nephew was dumb, but he left behind people that need my love and support.  so that's what they'll get, 110%.  i'm gonna try to put some good back into the world in the wake of this.  thanks to everyone who responded - i really appreciate it.",11
"i'm proud of my generation..  i'm 32. right in the middle of the millennial generation. 

you know what? we're awesome. we're dealing with crippling student loans, a horrible job market, a defunct political atmosphere, and a nearly unattainable american dream. older generations shit on us for not succeeding in what they see as the same world they grew up/matured in.  we're lazy/dumb/stupid/entitled, and it's our own fault if we struggle. 

you know what i see? thirty year-olds trying to eke out a living in their own way, working hard while still trying to be socially conscious and environmentally friendly. we were fed the american dream, but it somehow soured before we got a true taste. now we're all behind schedule according to our parents, trying to make families in our 30s and be financially stable in a volatile, unstable world. and yet we're still trying to have fun, trying to be social, trying to cope with a raw deal and still maintain our integrity. 

i'm proud of us. we're doing the best we can with the hand we were dealt, while being the societal scapegoat for other generations.

"my schizophrenic older brother killed our abusive parents.. this happened about seventeen years ago. today, all of these memories came flooding back for some reason or other. 

my parents physically abused me and my brother. i was very young, about six-years-old when they died, but i remember their anger and violence so clearly. my brother was ten years older than me. he always protected me. 

one day, my mom was punishing me for getting mud on the kitchen floor by holding my head in a sink filled with water. she was trying to drown me, i swear. i urinated on myself out of ear. it happened so quickly. i just remember my brother pulling me back, then he just choked my mother until she passed out. 

my brother hugged me and told me it's okay and then he went and murdered my father. both of them had broken necks. my brother was committed to a psych ward but killed himself. i went to live with my aunt and uncle and had a great life. 

i think everyone assumes that i've forgotten about this, but i haven't. i remember. i remember how hard i cried when my brother died, but i only allowed myself to break in secret, because everyone else labeled him as a monster. 

what he did was horrible, i understand, but he saved my life. i believe that. i know he loved me, and i loved him, and i miss him every single day of my life. 

just wanted to tell someone. hope you all have a good day. ",11
"its my birthday and i have a story. so hey. ive never posted on here but i'll do my best not to sound like a weenie. so im turning 24 today, not important, but it has been almost 6 years since a guy in my high school committed suicide. it is important that i didnt say friend because i honestly hardly knew him. we had one class together, gym, and we didnt really talk much. we were friendly with each other and knew each others names but that is about it. one day he helped me find a ring i dropped in gym and that was the most interaction we ever had. his name was cal r. obviously i wouldnt feel right saying his full name here but to this day i still remember him. i remember how he would dye his hair every few months. i remember how he would try half heartedly in gym. i remember how his parents accepted his diploma only a few weeks after his funeral. i remember the kids getting arrested because they spray painted ""remember cal"" under the bridge where he committed suicide. so i dont really know anything about him, what his home life was like, or why he did what he did. but i remember him, and i most likely always will. i'll remember his quick ""hey"" and ""how are ya"" in the hall or at lunch. i'll remember how excited he was to have found my ring. for whatever reason it really seemed to make him happy. what i'm trying to say i guess is. well i dont know what i'm trying to say. all i know is that he is gone forever and i'm sure a lot of people miss him. i hardly knew him and i miss him, the very fact that he isnt here makes me sad. so, i'll always remember cal and if you are in a place like that. people will remember you. no matter how alone or unwanted or anything negative you may feel. i guarantee someone will miss you. shit, if you say hi to me and tell me your name, i'll fucking remember you. so. please. keep trying, keep fighting even if it sucks. there are people, even if you dont quite know it, who will miss you. who will stop everything they are doing during the day and just. remember you, what you were like, what you could have become. so. as a certain character says ""keep struggling"" you can do it. i believe in you. and even if i dont know you, as a fellow human who knows what its like, i fucking love you. 

edit 1: okay i figured out that simply editing the thing is better than writing a random comment. im trying to get to as many comments as i can. i will definitely be responding to more tomorrow but i think its time for bed for me. but i want to thank everyone for making this a very memorable birthday. all of your stories has really touched my heart. so while i will be back tomorrow to talk and try to help anyone who needs it tomorrow i want to. i dont know leave a message now that i feel i have a platform. no matter how small an act or gesture, it can change the course of someones life whether you know it or not. so if you think something as simple as buying someone a candy bar at work is going to be pointless. it might make them feel wanted and thought about. so just. i dont know. spread love this month i guess. i'll be back tomorrow!

"i am a trump 'regretter' and i feel very isolated. sounds douchey, i know.. but hear me out-

i'm not sure if i was a victim of trolls and ads or not.  i was all for bernie, but seeing how the dnc did him really left me stumped.  between that, the clintons, and the rest of the hogwash that comes with her (read: debbie wasserman schultz) at the time i truly felt like i was making the 'lesser of two evils' choice.

"my sister dropped a plate today. i can be a bit of an arsehole at times but i'm working on it. i've realised that i often say backhanded compliments and could be kinder in general.

so when my little sister dropped a plate today in the kitchen, i wanted to be angry and annoyed, just for a split second. i wanted to ask her why she dropped that darn plate as there was food all over the floor now. i wanted to tell her to clean her mess up. but i realised that everyone makes mistakes, plus she's just 11 years old. and so the first thing i asked her was, ""are you hurt?"" i made sure that she didn't move and got her some shoes so she wouldn't step into any shards, picked up the big shards and vacuumed the kitchen. when she teared up and told me that she always breaks things, i assured that it was just a plate, it happens and there's still plenty of food left. (she later thanked me for cleaning up. she's a good kid.)

i know it's normal to be nice but i wanted to be angry. it was surprisingly easy not to be once i realised that mistakes happen and i've dropped tons of plates, mugs and glasses. i'm proud of myself for choosing to be kind.

i have been told by a doctor that i am in psychosis, but after a psychiatric evaluation i was told it is just my pre-existing diagnoses. i was called a liar, and they refused to give me any medication. things have only escalated, and i am unable to get any form of help due to living circumstances and losing my job.

every day feels fake, and i struggle with the concept of time and with following the current of 'real life' events in time.

also, to address the shopping incident that the title is referencing, i never touched or hurt anyone. i have quite a few visual and auditory hallucinations. i turned around in the freezer section and maggots were coming from her skin and climbing onto me. i screamed, but i didn't mean to. i'm truly sorry to those people, i really hope i didnt hurt anyone mentally or emotionally.

"if you think your anxiety/depression isn't that bad, it is.. i 22m have dealt with anxiety and depression since i was 12. i have never ever saw a therapist or took antidepressants and i was a mess. i harmed myself multiple times. i isolated myself in the dark. i had no friends. i would cry every single day. i used to do everything in my power to make this disease stronger. everything.

now, a year ago i was a senior in college. i lost my girlfriend at that time. i had a corporate job setup for after college (which is now present day) and i just was so stressed out with school. i isolated isolated isolated, cried cried cried, harmed harmed harmed. i was a anxiety freak over everything. i didn't do anything but just get scared of all that's around me. now, here's the thing. i thought my anxiety and depression weren't ""that bad."" i thought that everyone around me was ""over exaggerating"" or ""manipulating me and against me."" 

when i saw a therapist, that all went away. that all. went. away. my anxiety truly was the worst, and i think everyday about how horrible i was. it made me a different person. now, a year later, without anxiety and depression, i can tell you honestly that it was extremely terrible.

if you have anxiety or depression and think it ""isn't that bad,"" then i urge you to see somebody. that's what prevented me from going to a therapist, because i thought i didn't need one. it's crazy to think sometimes what our minds try to do to us. as if our behaviors are normal when deep down inside they arent. my anxiety and depression were definitely bad, and it takes a lot to admit it. look at your surroundings next time, and make a list of your reality vs what you want you're reality to be. then you'll see how bad it is. my actual reality was so different from where i thought my reality was. stop imagining alternate realities, and make on of those alternate realities your truth. stop downplaying your depression and seek help. we're all here for you.",11

"i got genital herpes when i was 13 years old.. i lost my virginity while simultaneously getting herpes when i was 13. my older sister guilt tripped me into telling my parents that i had it (as she was in the doctor's office with me). she believes that kids shouldn't hide anything from their parents.

my narcissistic step dad called me all the promiscuous names (euphemism) and told me that he personally would never date a woman who had herpes. he told me good luck finding someone who would ever love me. my mom proceeded to beat me with a stick she found in the garage. my sister provided no emotional support. my at-the-time boyfriend proceeded to post all about how he didn't have herpes on facebook (despite how i told him to keep it between us and how he was the only person i ever slept with).

that fucked me up for a very long time. i was extremely suicidal and self harmed for a few years. but on the bright side, i no longer talk to any of the aforementioned people and am extremely happy with my life now. i'm going to to the school of my dreams on a full ride and can't ever consider killing myself like i did as a kid.

"i learned today that my 14yo daughter has been so depressed that she's contemplated suicide multiple times.. i'll call her jane. that's not her real name. jane was born without a thyroid gland. there was a lot of medical appointments when she was an infant and toddler. she has to take a synthetic thyroid pill every day. not so bad. as the pediatric endocrinologist told us days after she was born: ""no parent wants their child to be born with a disease, but if you have to have a child born with a disease, you should pick this one because it only means she has to take a pill every day for the rest of her life. otherwise, she'll have a perfectly normal life.""

so at 14, she needs a blood test to determine her thyroid hormone levels every six months: that happens to be march and september for her. because of the way that health care works in the us, i have to take her to her primary care doctor each time in order for him to tell my insurance company to pay for the upcoming blood test.

today, during jane's checkup (but after a long conversation about her menstrual cycles), the doctor said, i need you to leave the room now. thinking myself a savvy and cool father, i figured this is when the the physician asks my daughter if she's sexually active. as i left the room, i said, ""jane, if the doctor writes you any prescriptions that you are embarrassed by, then i will not ask any questions."" there's no more direct way of indirectly saying, ""i won't judge you for being sexually active if the doc says you need birth control pills."" right?

so after 10 minutes in the room where i waited while the doc chatted with jane, the doc came in, and closed the door. ""i need to speak with you, mr. doe."" now, i'm not the type that deludes himself into thinking that his daughter will wait until marriage... or even perhaps to 18. 14 is a whole different ball game. my heart lept with fear that jane was sexually active.

that's when she showed me the paper that she had been carriying. there was nothing on it about sex. the whole form was about depression. i glanced at the questions about depression in which she usually checked off the category, ""multiple times every day"". my eyes suddenly became fixed on the two questions at the bottom of the page:

1. i have thought about suicide? (the yes box is checked)
2. i have thought about how to commit suicide? (the yes box is checked)
in the notes section for question 2: ""i thought about stabbing myself with a kitchen knife.""

now look, i've got a plan that i've started in conjunction with her doctor that involves psychologists, possibly psychiatrists and anti-depressant drugs, more frequent well-checks with the pcp, and even a vacation to her favorite place ($700 plane ticket) with her favorite cousin over winter break. i knew she was embarrassed, so i told her how i have had the same thoughts, and needed to be on prescriptions for those thoughts since returning from iraq in 2006. the point of this paragraph is that i don't need advice. i am confident in my plans. support is nice, but as the name of the subreddit suggests, i'm just getting this off my chest.

"my best friend from kindergarten had cancer. i saw him at the grocery store completely healthy. for the two years i've been in kindergarten (i was crying when my mom wasn't around me) i had around 3 good friends. one of them, let's call him gabe, didn't have hair. my child brain thought that he was born without hair or he lost it in an accident. i didn't ask because i didn't want to be rude. 

we had fun. we caught worms and snails, played with hot wheels and legos, generally a great buddy to play with. after i finished kindergarten i never heard from him again.

after some years i realised that he didn't have hair because of cancer. i cried 10 minutes about it, that poor child of 5 already struggled with cancer...

and then, i found him at the supermarket, buying vodka. when i realised that this was gabe, i was shocked. it was weird and cool to see a childhood friend but this different. i talked to him about 5 minutes and found out that...

...he was getting the vodka to celebrate 10 years cancer free.

whem i woke up this morning this post had i think 900 uovotes and it blew me away, i read through all the comments and it helped with my doubt of talking about it, i decided to wait to give an update until after my appointment, which ended about 45m ago. we talked about the use and what i'm potentially running from, i was given some mental excersises to do instead of use, which i figured i'd try since i dont technically have a physical addiction, i'm excited to fix myself and get out of this slump, i realize it will take time, but i truly believe i'm ready for it, and i honestly don't think i would have this amount of motivation if it werent for all you kind redditors, thank you so much. you truly made my day.

"i couldn't care less that xxxtentacion died.. the guy was known to beat his former significant others and even tried to walk away from it like it didn't matter. as someone who had their own mother abused by their piece of shit father, i can't stand up for anyone like him. i don't care if people ""liked his music"" or ""we should only remember the good a person has done"", there isn't enough good this guy did to overcome the negative he projected. he's everything i hated in a person and everything people needed to see to what a piece of shit human he was. i don't care about his career; i couldn't give two shits whether it was good or not to others (it wasn't). 

no amount of deeds he did would outshine how much of a terrible person he lead in his life. no one deserves to die, no one deserves to be shot point blank in broad daylight only to have onlookers just to have their last moments being snapchatted as they're dying. my condolences to his family and friends, but it'll still never change who he was and who he could have been. i'm not saying my life is a damn walk in the park or even be called a saint. but never have i thought for a moment to beat my pregnant girlfriend, slander women, and deny something that could change my life around if i just admitted my faults.",11
"to the tire store employee who helped me on december 24th 2009. i'll never forget you.

that was one of the biggest snow seasons our area had seen in quite a few years. i had spent every dime i had to purchase that brand new set of studded snow tires the previous week. no one expected the snow to stick, let alone stick around for the better part of the month.  i didn't have much money, and had to buy them unplanned so i could be sure my daughter would be safe when we drove to and from school, and so i could even get out and about as the roads were such a mess.

when i pulled in with the rear left completely flat, you asked me how long it had been driven on like that. i was honest with you. a long way. i had no way to remove it, the roads were a mess and down to one lane in most places. in the middle of many heavy snowfalls that month, it getting dark out, and with my daughter in the car, i had to just keep driving to get us somewhere safe, and warm, where we could figure out what to do.

we warmed up in the lobby. when you rolled that tire inside and your manager showed me the damage from driving on it flat, as well as the piece of metal you pulled out, i was shocked. he explained that it couldn't be saved. driving on it flat had destroyed it. i hadn't purchased the extended warranty and needed to buy a new tire.

i don't know what you saw in my eyes as i stood there after you told me that, but i feel like somehow you knew the situation i was in from that glance. 

a newly single father to a five year old girl. someone struggling to make ends meet. someone who didn't have a pot to piss in, let alone the money to even buy a nice set of tires like that to begin with. someone who was going hungry every night, watching my daughter eat dinner, and lying through clenched teeth that i had already eaten, so she should go ahead and i'll just sit with her. someone who had spent every penny i had that month. someone who was feeling more hopeless than ever in that moment.

you asked me to hold on for a minute, and you disappeared into the back with my tire through the door your manager had walked through. 

you came back a moment later without the tire.  i'll never forget trying not to break down and cry, as you told me it was obvious it was a defective tire. that it was flawed from the factory. that the hunk of metal that had pierced it, and the shredded rubber from me driving on it flat had nothing to do with the issue. that you were going to replace it for free then and there.

i don't know if you paid for it, or if you convinced the boss to replace it. i don't know why you wouldn't look me in the eye as i stood there trying to keep back tears, my 5 year old daughter hanging off me oblivious. maybe it was because you didn't want us to be a couple of guys having a cry together in the tire store during your busiest time of the year. whatever the case is, i want you to know, you saved me that day. saved me from the hopelessness i was feeling. restored my faith in humanity just when i was feeling as down as i had ever been. saved me from myself since i was at the end of my rope.

i want you to know, i've paid it forward ever since. helping stranded motorists. changing tires, giving jump starts, giving rides to people out of gas.  i even gave an elderly woman a ride later that week. she was waiting for the bus in knee deep snow trying to go to the library, and i pulled over and offered her a lift.

i want you to know that life is good now. i'm financially secure, everyone is healthy, happy and well fed. 

i want you to know, i'll never forget you.",11
"my rescue dog finally approached my boyfriend and let him pet her. edit: thanks for the gold and silver award, for loving dogs, rottweilers and supporting rescue rehabilitation!!!! 💝

my dog roxy, aka roxas, was rescued by my mother when i was a teenager, almost eight years ago now. an absolutely beautiful rottweiler, she had been horribly beaten and abused by her previous owner. the previous owner was a very tall male with beard and a deep, booming voice.

needless to say, to this day, if a tall man approaches her or the members of my family she loses her shit. when it came to integrating family members or getting a roommate, it was hard. she would aggressively bark with her hackles raised, standing protectively at a female's side and you would have to forcibly remove her from the room or else roxy would stress herself out horribly.

with daily, constant stimulation, roxy could warm up to a man in anywhere between two weeks to two months. that being said, my boyfriend would only come over once or twice a week or a few times a month. it was very stressful for both of them. my boyfriend worked with rescue animals at a time and absolutely loves all animals. he's a very gentle soul and he was so sad that roxy was so terrified.

however...my boyfriend is a 6'4"" bearded white male with a deep, booming voice.

six months pass.

two weeks ago she stopped barking at him constantly and would only bark if he moved around the room or stood up. last week she started brushing past him and even sitting near us without making a sound.

this morning? she ran up to him, sat in front of him, and stared at him. i told bf to command her to give him a high-five, and she did so happily. then.... she bumped her nose into his hand and for the first time since my boyfriend and i started dating she allowed him to pet her and melted into his arms. she's never let him pet her before. i was all waterworks.


just wanted to share :)",11
"i don't care about your open carry laws.. if you walk into a store with an assault riffle slung around your back i'm calling the police. i don't give a shit if your state allows open carry, i don't know you or your intentions and i'm not going to wait to find out.",11
"grandparents of millennials had it much easier, yet have a tendency to call out the youth for being weak little snowflakes.. they were able to go to college dirt cheap, much more easily able to afford a house, also pretty much guaranteed a job that could support a full, average sized family (yes, 1 job for 1 person supported that much).  all of this able to happen for them by about 23 years old. 

many had opportunities to work their way from intro low level jobs such as running errands and stocking the lobby, to coasting into high ranking management positions without much schooling.  positions held to this day, that require 6+ years of schooling and $100,000's of dollars in debt.

many of them were, ""happily married 60th wedding anniversary.

they could fill their gas tank for essentially scraps of change. 

but most of all, they were able to retire.  some at like 55 years old.  

**not us.**

**for us**, the chosen few lucky enough to get a scholarship and not have to spend the rest of their early adulthood paying off a piece of paper - they get the privilege of having to compete for a job where 10/200 applicants *might* get chosen. (200 who spend a minimum of 4 years in life/financial taxing poverty and pools of stress).  a pretty basic weeding out process most similar to that of battle royale games.

we work 2 high stress, physical/emotionally  demanding jobs just to make ends meet while living with our parents at 27.  

houses and gas are fucking expensive.

in this age, **for us**, the term ""happily married"". ends when one of the spouses gets caught sending/receiving dick pics from/to 17 different requesting recipients after a year 1/2 of marriage.

**for us**, we will work our high stress/physical demanding, multiple jobs to make ends meet.  we will troop through a society that views anything less then perfect as useless.  we will hopefully get support from the people that are established from a time of ease.  

but most of all, **for us**, we will work for scraps until we're fucking dead.

these people can take their entitled little fairy tale princess attitudes back to their little castles and thrive on hatred like some sort of hobby derived from being jobless for 3 decades.

now if you'll excuse me, i have to clock in for my 3rd shift today.



edit:  listen, i get they had to use practices that were physically more demanding. 

please don't tell me this when statistics tell me i'm probably talking to an overweight person.  i view physical labor as a gift.  i cherish my body and treat it like a temple on and off the clock.  i work 3 jobs, next semester will be my 4th year in college, save mostly all the money i can, after paying off car, school, hospital, phone, rent, utilities, etc... + the insurance required to cover all of those listed above and more.  i'm happy with my life even though it can be overly stressful at times.

*they* had their hardships, as does every generation.  but don't act like they didn't live a more comfortable, secure, and modest form of living, 9-5. 5, sometimes 6 day work weeks.

****  furthermore, i'm talking about america, i don't know where some people get off on some other completely random place in the world (yet relevant, i'll give em that).  i could easily say something just as truthful when i comment about the roman labor force of 100 a.d. having it better then the egyptian labor force of 200 b.c.
no.  i'm talking about current, breathing minds.  minds that go out into the world and impact the current situation in the 2019, november.  united states of america.****

moving forward, i'm incredibly thankful to live in a place where i don't have to run from bullets, dictatorships, bombs, starvation, government lockdown, plague, so on - so forth.  or have the opportunity to even work a job in the first place.  i cherish all of my jobs, my education, and take pride in myself in anything that i do, which work is a lot of.

i, and *we*, have the opportunity to do better, **yes we get it.** but simply being said - in no way compares to the actual risk, commitment, and sacrifice that is inevitable with such a follow through.  back then, this was in no way the levels in which it's at today across more fields then ever before.  quit portraying that i can find 1 job and make $100k a year by following your 4 sentence paragraph of, busting at the seams, loose ended statements sewn together by great advice to somebody that was my age 23 years ago.

truth is, i also respect the older generations like no other.  but i will also treat them like human-beings as i expect the same from anybody and nobody at the same time, when somebody isn't willing to do that, i can't help but take a note of the type of person saying this.  and old people are the primary ones to even mention this topic.

what *'they'* don't understand is the stress of being a cog in the machine that is tens of millions strong who commute, eat, sleep, fuck, cry, defecate and fight next to other people, jam packed next to one another at all times of the day.  they don't understand taking the high risk chance to fall in love in the age of social media, in this jam packed sti infested society.  they don't understand working for bosses receiving immense psychological pressure from the big wigs to compete harder, faster, and more precise then ever before.  a constant demand to a nation powered by caffeine, nicotine, sex, and social media.  devoting more and more time and effort every month, week, day, minute.. seconds. the labor force is constantly commanded to do more work for a wage that doesn't move much after a certain, and quick, point.  always demanding more of us.

they may be here, but they have no idea what it's like to grow up in any of this.  this was something gradual for them, but **for us**, we never had a chance to live in a time where there wasn't war and chaos flashing across the news.  they have no idea because they lived, loved, and settled in a less toxic/chaotic, more forgiving, less demanding, and more easy-going honest time.  

i appreciate all of the elder who granted me with their wisdom, you gave my life meaning more worth then anything i've come across to this day.  i took an oath as payback do the same for the generations to come until the day that i do not breathe.",11
"i accidentally used my reddit username instead of my real name.. so i'm in college and i do some online classes. i'm actually having a really hard time in this morning class, and i am not a morning person. 

so i get to my blackboard log-in and the page uses the same form as reddit's log in. so my real name and my reddit username both show up in a drop down list. i am positive that i clicked my actual name, but i log in as whippingshitties. since the list of people attending is ascending by alphabetical order, i did not realize my mistake before my professor did. and i didn't realize it until i was kicked from the session. my professor did not have a sense of humor about it. fortunately, a few late people logged in at around the same time i logged back in with my proper name, so no one can pin me to it per-se... unless my professor can also see my ip. i'm still extremely embarrassed about it, especially since i am struggling in that class. like, yeah, it's fucking hilarious, but also what i would consider a bruh moment on my part. 

i wonder how many of my classmates googled what whipping a shitty means. 

and i wonder if any of my classmates put two and two together and looked up my /u/. 

at any rate, go greyhounds, i guess.

i work in it,  more specifically data mining.  it is a primarily male field, and i only learned sql a couple years ago so i would have never imagined i would be this successful. my whole life, i have over compensated for my lack of intelligence with a great work ethic and it finally paid off! i am so proud of myself. 

unfortunately, i feel money is a touchy subject and this is not something i can share my excitement about in real life.

"i kissed my baby over and over again not knowing if each one might be the last.. my beautiful baby girl is now 10 months and she is the light of my life.

just under a day after she was born she started to have seizures. she was taken from me and sent to another hospital. 
i was in a lot of pain from having a c-section but i had to get up and walk and pretend i was ok otherwise i wouldn't of been allowed to join her.
i stayed in the ward below her and would walk up to see her all hours of the day and night, sometimes clinging on to the walls to catch a breath from the pain.
i waited outside her room and heard her screams as they did 4 lumbar punctures. my heart was broken and no one knew what was wrong with her.
they sent us home after 3 weeks to wait and see if she had any more seizures.
the next day she had more at home and we took her to the emergency room in an ambulance.
when we arrived there were so many doctors and nurses and i knew it was serious.

no one told me to move out of the way as they inserted wires into her head and body. some people may have asked me to but they just let me kiss her and hold her hands.
i just kissed her tiny face over and over and in my head i kept saying if this is the last kiss then please know that i love you so much.
it took 8 hours until the seizures finally stopped and my heart broke every time she was taken from me, wondering if i would ever see her again.

just under ten months later she is now being weaned off her medication and her future looks really bright.

i kissed her little cheek today and thought wow i can't believe there was a time when i thought one kiss might be the last. i'm so grateful for her and all the medical professionals who helped her.

*edit*

wow thank you so much i did not expect such a huge response. you are all such loving, supportive, amazing people and thank you for sharing some of your stories with me too. 
for those who have asked, she had tonic clonic seizures. they are different to febrile seizures but both are very distressing and i am sorry some of you have had to go through a similar situation. it really is not something you can prepare for as a parent, i hope you are all doing ok.

for those that have asked what the cause was, we are still not sure entirely but they have carried out all the tests possible to be confident that there will not be any more. we will be keeping an eye on things for a while longer as her calcium is still high but it is all looking very positive. she does have a chromosome abnormality which has been detected but with no known clinical consequence so far, so all in all it's looking like things will be ok.

for the person who called me out on the spelling of no one (i spelt it knowone)! i have literally been spelling it like that my entire life and had no idea i was wrong. thank you i've edited the spelling mistake 😊 

and to all of you lovely lovely people....may your god, spirits, energies or just plain old good luck and vibes bring you happiness in your lives.

"this is 20 years too late. . hello everyone. this is a rather tragic story. it will not be suitable for light hearts. it's my deepest, most darkest history, which led to my own near-death many, many times. 

20 years ago, germany, 1993. i was 20 years old. i had two sons. their names will stay with me. but i will provide aliases. my youngest, mathieu, was 14 months old. and his older brother sam, 2 years of age. mathieu was the happiest of children. he would smile at you even if he didn't know who you were. he was the sweetest, happiest little boy to ever cross into my life. both of my sons were all i needed and wanted. my wife and i were 18 when she got pregnant. she was so happy, that i couldn't even grimace. i swore my self to her and married her when she was 6 months pregnant with my sam. she was so beautiful then. her smile could make a well kept man go mental. she was an extraordinary specimen. 

                         the incident. 

 it was a freezing winter's morning. 19°f.  the roads were slick; the people's coats were packed on like the snow blankets covering the ground. i had work at 9 am that morning. i awoke to mathieu; crying. it was 8:43. i had to be at work in 17 minutes. my boss had a no tolerance policy and would dock your pay for too many tardinesses. i knew i couldn't be late. 

 i got my son and myself ready and was out of the door by 8:51. i was rushing my son and i to my mother's house, time was ticking. my lateness was inevitable. my speed picked up as my worries did. as soon as i realized, i was going 50mph in a 30mph. i had no time to stop. i skidded over the crosswalk line into oncoming traffic. i whizzed by every other car coming from side to side. but instead i was headed for a large industrial truck. my whole life flashed before me, time was going extremely slow. i felt as if i was the grim reaper, watching this ordeal from an orb of some sort. and *i* chose my fate. i came back to reality to see me nearing the truck. i maneuvered my truck to hit my side of the his. hoping to save me from my son's injury. it was no use. i survived, woke up in a hospital some time later with a broken  femur and head trauma. my son's neck was broken from the impact. he died instantly. 

i remember telling the nurse ""i want to see my son. i need to know he's okay."" she looked away, hiding her tears, and replied. ""your son is no longer with us. he died instantly from the crash. i'm sorry"" i.. i honestly could not explain the feelings after that. to know that it was your fault. you killed your own son because you didn't want to be late for work. you didn't want to get yelled at by your boss. like your job is worth taking your own son's life. after that day, my whole life changed. my wife blamed me and left without a trace. the next time i saw her, was 16 years later. she was sitting in a casket. she died from a fall while mountain climbing. the last time i saw her alive. she was crying and yelling at me, she wanted me to take my son's place. and frankly, i did too. i still do. 

since then, i've had 3 suicide attempts, several broken bones. i sliced two of my fingers clean off. (irrelevant, it was from an office guillotine.) many run ins with the law, and overall, a broken, beaten, shrivelled up heart. a heart that is set in stone. and unmendable heart. 

he would've been 21. i could've taken him and my eldest son out for a beer, like good men. and we would be a family. i would've still had my wife. i knew she loved adventure, and i wouldn't have let her go mountain climbing. i still love my wife. i still think about we everyday. and i wish i could go back and fix all of this. but i can't. you never can. life gives you the worst options, and you have to deal with them, or die. it's one feeling knowing that someone died because if you, it's a whole other, morbid feeling to know that it your own son. and that of a toddler. 

though i shed many tears as i wrote this, it feels so amazing to just scream it all. the weight of this will only be lifted when i take my final breath. but only with the support of my remaining son, and my will to live, i will remain. thank you all for reading. 

regards, mathias. ",11
"stage iv colon cancer at 31. not much to it. i'm 31 and dying. have lead a relatively healthy life. i eat ok - much better than most. i've been running three times a week and lifting weights 3 times a week since college.

i don't smoke. i don't drink much - maybe 3-4 beers on a friday and a little more on holidays like new years.

i just need to vent. i went to the doctor a year ago because i knew something was up. i was dismissed. didn't think much of it.

i went back a few months later - i was dismissed.... ""people my age don't get cancer, don't waste money on tests""

well, hah, it was cancer! pretty upset that multiple doctors tell me people my age don't get cancer when a quick google search shows a large increase in young people getting colon cancer - i get the doctors didn't get the memo? 

it's easy to be mad at the doctors but that is not really fair. there's no one really to be mad at. i kinda wished that i downed cheeseburgers and cigarettes and then at least i could blame myself.

it's all sh**. what a sh** life. had a crappy childhood. dad out of the picture, mom bouncing between boyfriends and constantly moving me around - never really had a chance to make friends.

from 18-28 i worked shit retail jobs, bars, restaurants, just making ends meet and surviving. on my 29th birthday i made a change and went to college. i was set to graduate with a cs degree in three years and finally start my life. well i guess that is not gonna happen.

i'd rather i got hit by a bus one day out of no where than live in this hell. no friends. no family. no money to do anything. gonna spend my last months smoking pot and playing with dogs at the shelter, then i'm gonna die a crappy death. kinda puts my other problems into perspective... ranted its a little late now.

thanks for reading. watch your health. don't let doctors convince you nothing is wrong (assuming you're not naturally a worry-wort). 

i don't think i ever went to the doctor in my adult life, i always ""waited it out"" and new i was fine. then when i knew something was wrong, i should of had more confidence in myself in knowing that.

"i know parenting is hard, but if your kids are being terrible and someone complains, your answer should not be ""mind your own fucking business"". my ex took our 2 year old to the park so i could get some much needed study time. our county park has a sprinkler area that's mostly for toddlers and little kids. for the most part, everything was fine.

then a mother and her 3 sons arrive, the youngest of whom apparently looked like he could be 11. mom sits herself at the nearby sitting area facing away from the sprinklers so she can play on her phone. the boys start roughhousing, wind up hitting one kid and almost hitting our daughter. the family of the kid who got hit don't notice and don't care, but my daughter is scared and runs to her dad. 

her dad, understandably upset, goes up to the mother and says, ""excuse me, your sons hit one kid and almost hit my daughter. could you watch your children?""

as the title says her response was, ""why don't you mind your own fucking business?""

now parenthood sucks. you're tired all the time and with three rowdy boys, i can only imagine how amazing a little me-time where you get a moment to unwind. but you don't get to check out of being a parent and you damn sure don't get to pretend there aren't consequences to your kids' actions.  

boy, sometimes i hate other parents.",11
"i just found out my boyfriend of 5 months is married and my best friend knew all along.. so last year my best friend asked me to accompany her to visit her boyfriend for a few days. he had a roommate so she took me along. once i met him, we immediately hit it off and had a great time for the two days we stayed over. after returning to my place we kept in touch constantly and after a few months became official.

i was so deeply into this guy and honestly thought he was the one. last night there was a photo of him tagged on facebook with another lady holding a baby, and all the comments are complimenting them on  what a wonderful family it is. i was a bit confused so i asked my friend and she goes ""oh yeah _her guy_ told me he has a wife he's hardly committed to and a kid""

my head was spinning, i can hardly think or do anything. it's so painful i never knew i would be this affected. i've confronted the guy and he's so apologetic claiming he never really got the right time to tell me.

i'm so pissed off at both my friend and the guy i've cut ties with both of them. my friend's excuse is that she thought it was his place to tell me. what kind of an excuse is that?

i don't know how to move on and seriously needed to get that off my chest.",11
"i just left my wife. and i feel 100% fine about it.. i have a reddit account, however i thought i'd use a throwaway for this one. 

ten years ago i thought i had the perfect life. upper six-figure job, beautiful wife, clean house, two new cars, and a child on the way. my job made me happy and i was good at it, and the stability was great. my wife loved me for me and ignored my flaws as i tried to perfect them. in return, i adored her and we seemed to be the perfect couple. people would always compliment us, and talk about how envious they were of our relationship and everything.

it kept getting better. i kept getting promotions, the kids (now 3) were born, and we eventually moved from an ordinary house to an incredibly nice one. my wife was doing very well in her career (optometrist), and we took fun vacations every year. again, i thought i had it made. 

i don't know how this would have prompted it, but in early 2015, i bought her a tesla, for her birthday. she hadn't gotten a new car since 2008, and i kept getting new cars, therefore i surprised her. she loved it, loved me, and i remember spending that entire day just taking rides in it and figuring out how all of the gadgets and icons worked. 

it was complete downhill from there. i don't know how that would have triggered anything, but in the months following, she became increasingly distant from not only me, but our children. my oldest (10, f) in particular, felt hurt by this and would often try to ensue conversations with her mother, in order to get her talking. some days this would work and she would be pleasant, others it would have the opposite effect. 

the first time i suspected that i was no longer her man of choice was in july 2016 when i noticed she was no longer going to yoga classes, but telling me she was. we were on the same phone plan, and part of that plan was we could see our locations of our phones. i was routinely browsing the app one day, and noticed she appeared to be at someone's house. since she had been irrationally angry that day prior to leaving, i didn't question her about it when she got home from ""yoga."" instead, i chose to closely observe where she went during her ""yoga"" times. it would always seem to end up at the same house - a well-off neighborhood (probably a step above ours) a little north of town. 

i was getting ready to confront her when i noticed that she had been returning to yoga again. during this period, she became incredibly distant, and hormonal. my entire family had noticed this behavior going on for over a year now, but i had had enough. i sat her down, and asked her what was going on. she gave me the cold shoulder, and when i questioned her about the yoga locations, she accused me of stalking, invading privacy, and being a ""grade-a dick."" 

that's when i asked her: ""are you cheating on me?"" of course, the answer was no. what followed in the weeks to come was distrust, hatred, and plain anger towards me. it was clear she knew i had caught on, and was now trying to play the ""i-can't-believe-you'd-think-this"" victim card. but i knew. i saw through it all.

when she finally admitted she had seen and slept with another man, that's when i made my mistake. i forgave her. she told me she loved me, she loved our family, and in that moment, i believed her. i thought she could change. i was wrong. 

we tried marriage therapy. we tried taking adult days. it seemed to work. we were happy, and she was genuinely having fun and it seemed like i had the old her back. i was relieved, this allowed me to pour more time into my kids and my work, and have less stress overall. 

my business trip to san diego (i live on the east coast, usa) was cut short when my colleague fell ill, and our clients insisted that we reschedule. it was a hassle, but i we caught the next flight out, and returned home. 

i'm not sure why i didn't tell her i was coming home, but i just didn't. maybe i wanted it to be a surprise? the only surprise i received when i pulled into the driveway was seeing a ford suv in my garage, and finding not one, but two men in my bed. with my wife. 

this all happened yesterday. i'm finally putting it into words. my wife started babbling when it happened, desperately trying to explain. i heard none of it. i walked out of my room, went to the basement, and poured myself a drink. i could hear the men upstairs leaving, and when i returned upstairs, it was my wife sitting there, clothed, with a sad smile on her face. 

she started talking, but i wouldn't have it. i told her to get out. i told her to get out of my house. i informed her that i'd get her stuff to her by the end of the week. she tried to pull the ""what-about-the-kids"" bullshit, but i was just done. i'm sad, but not for her. i'm sad for my kids, and i'm sad for whatever poor soul she meets next. 

i will fight hard for my kids, but my biggest fear is losing them. i know the court will rule incredibly in favor of mothers. i hope they realize that i've spent the last three years doing my best to mend a broken marriage for my family, and nothing has worked. 

i told my kids this morning. they asked why mom didn't spend the night last night. i didn't make them go to school today, they're all upstairs together. this whole situation is terrible for everyone involved, and it could have been completely preventable. 

i don't pity my wife. i hope that she has one label for the rest of her life - cheater. i want it to follow her. i want people to know. she is a prominent optometrist in our area, this could very well hurt her business if word spreads, which it very well may.

thank you all for listening. if you have undergone something similar, i'd love to chat. 



**edit:** what a wave of support! wow! i will try and get back to all of your comments, please forgive me if i do not. this makes me feel a lot better. i've never been gilded before!",11
"my mom is in hospital and my brothers took her dog to the animal shelter.. my mom is in the hospital with a broken hip. she is due to be released this week. my brothers dropped off her 15 year old yorkie at the animal shelter on their way out of town yesterday. they are going to the cottage and didn't want the hassle of her dog.  today i'm going to try and get him out of the shelter. i really hate them.

edit: thank you all! it was a big help being reminded  that i'm not wrong or crazy being so upset at my brothers for doing this. to give you an update - the shelter considered it a 'change of mind' and released my mom's dog to me without further paperwork. he's had a really hard time, poor guy! he's deaf and a little senile so his one night at the shelter was not good. i'm going to keep him here with me for now and keep a close eye on my dogs when they are together. he's just not doing well enough for another change. 
as for my brothers... i was almost at the point of stroke this morning because i was so upset thinking about what they'd done. i don't want to think about it anymore because it's not helping me or my mom when i get this upset. so, screw them! i'm going to watch out for my mom and do what i need to do so that she is treated right.",11
"i grew up in a far-right military family believing the us was by far the best place to live. after travel, i learned i was very wrong. i spent the last few weeks traveling around europe. i won't get into the details since that's more suited for a travel forum but needless to say it was one of the best decisions i ever made and it was the first time i left the us. 

i have a great job with lots of vacation time saved up, and a woman i love who is in similar circumstances. she's more of a free-spirit than i am and she wanted to spend our planned vacation going from town to town in europe while i was content spending a weekend away at a nearby beach. she won. 

i grew up believing the us was perfect in about every aspect. i'm not military much to my dad's disappointment but he was along with both of my grandfathers. we were told to love reagan, we had flags, we stood proudly during the anthem during the sporting events, we supported the iraq war 100%, and my father thinks the nfl is a traitorous organization. anything that questions american superiority should be silenced right away, blah blah. i just kind of grew up thinking the same thing though not as strongly. i seriously believed pretty much every other place on the planet is a bit of a shithole and i'm living the best life any human can. 

i know i was on vacation and that provides a different perspective on life than a resident, but getting to know people outside of the us on a personal level and how they live, i can't say for sure anymore the us is ""#1"" anymore. i've seen cultures not driven by excess and greed, not succumbing to obesity and stress at an early age, who believe that the group is stronger than the individual. i've seen impressive infrastructure, what can happen when the governments work for the people. i'd much rather be able to read a few chapters on a train to work than be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for 90 minutes a day. when i went through borders and security at train stations and airports i wasn't treated like a potential criminal like the tsa but i was treated like a human. countries outside the free travel zone let us enter their country with a quick check, but when i was entering my own country i had to fill out a long two-page form and get asked about ten questions by a border security guy just drooling to bust someone for committing a minor crime. 

i was told by my family visiting europe was a mistake. they spewed some talking points fed to them by people with an agenda. they thought i'd be murdered due to all this sudden and rampant crime over there. they wanted me to be very careful in london, a city they believe you can't go out in after dark (beautiful city, lovely people, never once felt unsafe). sadly i bought into their warnings and when i first arrived i was on edge, but very shortly after i relaxed and so glad i did. 

i can't imagine those places are perfect, no place is perfect. i do think overall quite a few of the places we visited offers a higher quality of life than i maintain in the us and i'm considered to be pretty successful by us standards. ",11
"i made my father cry. have to start off by saying that my dad is a rock. in a family with a history of mental illness and addiction, he has always been steadfast, never losing his cool, never losing control. he holds the family together. 

and yesterday i made him cry. after being homebound for 3 years, struggling with severe depression and anxiety, i finally got myself a part time job in a children daycare. i got a text from my boss yesterday, because they wanted to commend me for how good i am with the kids, and how happy they are to have me onboard. i read the text aloud to my dad, and he started crying. he hugged me and told me how proud he is of me. the only other time i've seen him cry was when i tried to commit suicide. i feel accomplished and happy for the first time in many years.

"i finally told her. there is this one girl i know since i'm 12. we were in the same school and finished this summer.

a year ago i fell in love with her .

today i wrote her a letter and gave it to her. now i'm waiting for her response, but i'm glad i had courage to do this at all.

edit: thanks for all the likes and comments. seeing that my post has motivated some of you is more than i ever expected. 

update to this story: she said no. she packed it in very polite words, but a no is still a no. at least now everything is cleared up and i don't run around with the feeling that i want to tell her something.

"no one else knows what i did today.. for most of my life i have always wanted to have lips with more volume. i didn't mind how it looked, but always felt self conscious. 

i am 32 and had my first lip injections this morning, i only had 0.5ml injected to avoid the duck look and from others in my house from noticing, and i am loving it! my boyfriend doesn't even know what i did, and he didn't even notice the difference when i got home. besides the staff at the clinic no one knows what i did, and it helps my self-esteem immensely already. even though no one knows, i wanted to share my positive experience with someone. 😀

edit: thank you everyone for your support and encouragement! i am glad that i made this post, it's great to see all of the positive feedback along with others that either are/want to get fillers too. as my wise middle brother said: ""aim to be the person you want to be, it will take time but you will be much happier in life."" that quote is always in my head now, and it's true.",11
"i can't wait to propose to my gf. she sent me two selfies a little bit ago and i just stopped and stared at them for a while and everything hit me all at once.  all of the feelings of being with her.  

i can't even really explain how it made me feel just thinking about it, i started to cry because of how happy it makes me.  which is saying something because i never express myself, even when i'm alone.  

i love her so much, words i say pretty much everyday if not multiple times a day.  but this was different, this was pure joy like i've never felt before.  the kind where you watch a movie or read a book and some touching moment happens that makes you want to cry.  except that's how i felt just looking at picture of my gf, not actually being in her presence, just thinking about it.  just thinking about how much effort and thought i put into proposing or what ring to get and suddenly i realize that it doesn't matter, that i'm going to completely lose my composure and smile uncontrollably and might even tear up a little because i've never wanted something like this so bad before.  

i know this is too much of a cluster fuck of words to be upvoted but dammit i'm so fucking happy.

**edit:** thank you for all of the very kind words.  i know she's going to say yes but i'll post an update when it does finally happen.",11

"teachers from hell. for precalculus we are required to have a graphing calculator. my family cannot afford a graphing calculator and while i tried to tell the teacher my problem **in private** he uses me as an example and announces to the whole class ""if you cannot afford a graphing calculator like ponytailparade, then get a job or find someone who will let you share"". just because i'm a junior does not mean i am old enough to get a job and you had no right to announce my inability to buy something to the *whole class*. you suck.

"something my ex-band member said to me last night has me rattled.. they use reddit, and to be honest, if they're reading, good.

they were my friend in addition to band member. i was ""fired"", in very vague terms, and replaced by a 60 year alcoholic (i am 24). i started my own band and reworked a song that i had presented to them into my new band.

i log on facebook yesterday with an essay of a message, about how i need to remove it from our demo, how i'll be sued if i use it as ""they did the work, i just played a few chords"". 

at the end of this message was the line that really got me --

""don't pretend this is an original my name composition. we all know you aren't good enough to write a song that good.""

i took the song down, why? because i spoke to my father, who i trust and he told me in no less words, ""be the bigger man and let them get what they want this time, their time will come soon"". i didn't want an unnecessary issue -- i have enough.

but you know i said ....

you say i'm not good enough to write a song and that's your biggest flaw. i wish you success, and i wish success on myself.

today i wrote a new song. and every fucking day now i will write a song, until one day i write the greatest song you've ever heard. i won't crush you with my fists, or in some petty claims court, no fuck that.

i will crush you where it hurts. where you think you are best.

watch me.

if i get addicted to a song i will literally sit and listen to that one song on repeat for hours on end. currently that one song is the acoustic version of samurai cop from dave matthews tinydesk. previous winners have been indiana - adrienne lenker and you're a big boy now - john sebastian,11
"i hate being a mom. i don't know where to start. but i'm hoping someone else on here can at least understand what i'm feeling without judging me or telling me things like ""you don't know how lucky you are; a lot of people can't even have kids!"" i know. and although i should be completely over the moon about my awesome kid, i'm just...not. 

it started with the pregnancy. the second i found out i was pregnant, i had a strange feeling. not the one of excitement or a bit scared, but that i didn't want it. deep in my gut, i knew i made a terrible decision to get pregnant. my husband and i agreed to try, though i was still on the fence. i also didn't think i could get pregnant because i had horrible problems with ovarian cysts my whole life and doctors told me i wouldn't be able to get pregnant past 30 (there were other reasons too but i won't get into them). i was 34, so i figured, what the hell, we'll try (he really really wanted kids), and when i can't have them at least we'll say we tried. well, turns out it only took one try. one. i know. most people would consider that so incredibly lucky, and trust me i am well aware of the people out there who struggle with infertility. 

as the weeks went on i struggled with absolutely terrible morning sickness until about week 22. that's a long time, especially how sick i was. around week 22/23 i started to feel a little better, especially because i knew i was more than halfway done with that hellish experience. at week 28 i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and was back and forth to doctors every five seconds. i felt like a science experiment. 

i was induced at 41 weeks and only pushed for 12 minutes. he came out in 5 pushes. again, i know. luckiest person on the planet especially because i had an epidural that worked like a charm. but the second i held him i didn't want him. i wanted to give him back. i felt no emotional connection. nothing. and then i hemorrhaged. and then i developed eclampsia, which is high blood pressure after birth. it was the most hellish three days of my life, thinking i was going to have a seizure or stroke and possibly die. finally when i got released from the hospital on a myriad of medications, i didn't want to be there at all. it wasn't the same home.

it wasn't the home of cooking all-day meals, spontaneous trips to the wineries, sitting and reading a book for hours. i didn't realize i actually cared about any of these things until they were gone. and that gut feeling of not wanting  a baby only got worse. 

in the next weeks and months i struggled with what was eventually diagnosed with postpartum depression and postpartum ptsd. it was absolutely terrible and i contemplated suicide many times. the lack of sleep paired with those things made me feel like a complete lunatic. my marriage suffered, and i believe my husband and i will never be the same because of what occurred in those months with my emotions.

fast forward to today. my husband does so much to help me. he's there every second i need him and works right down the road, so he can be home in a second if i truly need something. my parents watch my son one day and my in-laws another day. but it's not enough. i don't want to be around him. i'm bored to tears playing toddler games and even going to the playground and stuff with him. i'm looking at my watch every five seconds. 

part of the problem is that i work from home. i was very, very talented and successful in my office job, which eventually converted to a work-at-home position. so by default, i became a stay-at-home mom. let me make one thing clear: i never ever ever wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. i made this very clear from the beginning, and i absolutely said i would never do it. i'm not cut out for it. and here i am. sitting home with him, day after day. we do tons of things. he takes gym classes, art classes, we play outside all the time, go on outings, go to the food store. he's clean and well-fed and loved and always entertained and happy. he really is a great kid. 

but i hate this. like with every fiber of my being. hate it. the sleep transitions, the teething, the not wanting to eat the food i make, the tantrums, everything. like literally everything you can think about having a kid, i hate it. and the noise. omg the noise. the tantrums, the kid songs that make you go insane.... i just can't anymore. 

i feel like being a mom brings out all of my worst personality traits. i didn't even know i was impatient, but apparently i am! i get so frustrated with him so quickly, and i have silent little anxiety attacks while i discipline him or deal with whatever is going on. 

i just am so surprised - and weighed down - by the responsibility. i am one of the most responsible people on the planet. always early to things, always organized, always on top of stuff. i have a dog, who i got as a puppy and i take a lot of pride in training her and being her dog mom. i have nieces who i take care of from time to time and i take what i say and do around them very seriously. and my job is extremely integrated with other people and working with teams. i am a director, so a lot of people rely on me. but shit. this is too much. being responsible for a little human being, and every single thing i say is going to affect them in some way??? no thank you. it is a weight that is suffocating me every second of the day. and i wasn't expecting that. on paper, i should actually be a great mom. but i'm really not.

and i don't know what to do. i went to therapy, was on medication, everything. but i feel like the only thing that would truly make me happy would be to go back to work full-time in an office job. right now i piece together my work. when he's napping - if he naps - at night, early in the morning. i can never concentrate and what was once a bright and lucrative career now leaves me stressed out and awake at 3 a.m. wondering how i'm going to get my work done. i can't concentrate and its like he needs something every other second. i keep waiting to like it. i keep waiting to feel something. but i don't. 

and don't get me wrong. when he hurts himself or cries from being sad, my heart breaks. when my parents pull away with him in the car and i see his little face in the back seat i miss him. but then...he gets back and i'm like...when can he go over their house again???? it is truly the strangest feeling. i'm confused. and if anything ever, ever happened to him i don't know what i do. he is a sweet, gentle, loving, kooky kid. always laughing and smiling, and i make sure to give him tons of hugs and kisses every single day and tell him i love him. i don't ever want him to know these things i'm saying here. 

thank you for listening, whoever is out there. i pray you will not judge me. my husband is absolutely wonderful, but he hates when i try to talk about this kind of thing. we've always been very open about all of our feelings and issues, but he gets so angry when i try to tell him that i really truly don't like this. he doesn't believe me and says ""you make yourself not like it."" i'm not sure what to think about that. but alas.

"i walked in on a rape. excuse the title, i didn't know what else to start with. this has been on my mind heavily for the past 2 years or so.

for some background this occurred when i was 26, at my own apartment that i shared with four roommates.

my roommate m went out with his friend c to a few clubs and bars. c was nice enough but he was into early 30s and still had the frat boy attitude and there was always something about him that i didn't like. i didn't feel unsafe around him or anything its just he was ""off"" a bit, he became too friendly too fast.

m and c returned at about 2am. i'd been watching netflix and heard them come in so i came out to say hi. m and c had brought back two ladies. i politely said hello, shook their hands and made small talk. after about 5 minutes m and his ""date"" went back to his room to hook up. c and his ""date"" stayed in the living room as every other bedroom was off limits.

i went and refilled my glass of water that was by my nightstand. i don't know why i forgot it on my way back to my room. but i did. 5 minutes after returning to my room i realized i'd forgotten my glass of water.

i stepped out of my room and diagonally across from me on a loveseat was a c, he was trying to take this girl's shirt off. she was trying to push it back down. she locked eyes with me, and c snapped and turned toward me, yelling ""dude, just fuck off!!"" i didn't say anything i just looked him dead in the eye. he got up and sat on the other couch sulking like a child that had just had a toy taken away. the girl rushed to the other side of the room and zipped her coat back up.

during this twenty second ordeal this girl's coat, pants, boots, sweater and t-shirt stayed on. there is no doubt in my mind what would've happened if i'd not walked out then.

i never told m because not only was c one of his closest friends but i don't think he'd believe it. i told one of my other roommates, who told me to just forget about and not worry because it wasn't my business. what worries me is that c was sober enough to know what he was doing, and that he tried this shit at another person's apartment. i don't want to think about any of the girls he's brought to his apartment in the past, or will in the future.

i offered to call the police, she declined saying that she didn't want to be a bother, and that it'd just inconvenience everyone.

you're probably wondering why i've never told the police. well honestly, unless they find that girl and she presses charges they'd have no case beyond what she and i would say. now that years have passed every other shred of potential evidence is gone.

i spoke to my mom who's a psychiatric nurse specializing in treating sexual abuse victims who told me that was absolutely the beginning of a rape. i told a friend who's a former cop and he agreed to.

i'm not the kind of person who immediately believes an accusation, but i know what i saw. i didn't just walk in on a rape, i walked in on every woman's worst nightmare.",11
"brother exposed to my extremely religious family, out of revenge, that i'm not muslim, and has ruined my life. but some good came out of it.. i'm a 21 year old college student.  

&nbsp;

older brother has known i'm not muslim for a while, and we come from an extremely religious family. we got into a fight a month ago and, to exact the dirtiest possible revenge against me, he called my parents and told them everything: how i drink occasionally, party and befriend women (how awful, right?), and don't believe in god. 

&nbsp;

now my family has disowned me; my mom has been crying for the past few weeks, dad told me on the phone to never: come back home, speak to my 2 sweet younger siblings whom i love dearly, speak to my mother. also, my father was helping pay off my tuition and my housing, now he's cut me off. thanks to my brother. tried calling dad but he's blocked me, same with mom. won't let me talk to the siblings in any shape or form. had several terrible panic attacks and frequent mental breakdowns. 

&nbsp;

anyways, went to a close friend's party 2 weeks afterwards. wasn't planning on going, but decided to go anyways after friend insisted i'd feel better; what'll you have it, i met a girl from malawi. we seriously hit it off, for the first time in 2 weeks had some mental clarity. i got her number, and we went on a date the next day. we were going back to her place, then my brother called and humiliated me; somehow he knew what i was doing, and i've no idea how (if anyone has any idea how this could be, please tell me, i can provide more info privately).  

&nbsp;

after being screamed at and told i was a piece of shit, i hung up and tried to tell her what happened, but instead broke down heaving and crying in front of her. she didn't say a word, put her arms around me, and let me sob on her shoulder while patting my back. keep in mind this was the second day since we'd met. 

&nbsp;

she wasn't weirded out about the incident at all, and was so unbelievably gentle and compassionate about it all. since then, she's been messaging me every day sending me depressing 2meirl4meirl memes (well-meaning in a hilariously inappropriate way), keeping tabs on me and making sure i'm okay, inviting me over to her place and just cuddling and relaxing with one another. she's always smiling, optimistic for no reason, and just a dancy, awesome person. i'm so fucking relieved that someone so great made it into my life, and at quite possibly the most necessary timing possible. i have no idea what i'm going to do about my family that has derided and abandoned me, or my mentally abusive, manipulative helicopter brother, but at least i found someone to help me forget about it all. 

&nbsp;

edit: appreciate everything u guys are saying, for both the advice and the well-wishes. genuinely, thank you.  
not hating on islam, and my parents aren't shitty to be clear, my brother is. my parents are actually great, hard-working people. but muslim parents finding out their kid drinks and has a girlfriend is almost the equivalent of a white person's parents finding out their kid does heroin. i disagree with their reaction, but i can totally understand why they're acting this way.  
also, i meant this post as optimistic in spite of all the garbage that has been happening. i already have a plan for paying off my final semester, getting support from amazing friends, cutting off ties entirely with family (not with my younger siblings though), finding a job, etc.

"i am sick of being reminded constantly how nobody cares about pedophilia.. i once argued with my father about bowie having raped a 15 year old girl, and it's incredible all the excuses he would try to find to excuse it or make it seem like it wasn't that big a deal at all. he actually told me at some point ""no, i am explaining things you don't yet understand to you"", and i am so enraged. my father thinks i'm a complete idiot. i've been abused by my grandfather my whole childhood before my mother finally decided to estrange my grandparents (for reasons unrelated, nobody in my family knows about my abuse). i've been living with this my whole life. i know what the fuck i'm talking about. 

and when i speak up about woody allen all i hear are excuses. i've had my boyfriend get upset at me for saying pedophiles should die. all i ever hear is excuses. how we must dissociate the artist from the art. how child porn is good, because that way the poor pedophiles can ""satisfy their urges"". how the pedophiles are suffering, they're so alienated from society, they're so in pain…

what about me? do i need to keep making myself tiny, silent, do i need to keep forcing myself to feel compassion for the people who broke me? do i need to keep praising the man on the screen while a traumatized woman who used to be a little girl he assaulted is breaking down in her home at the mere mention of his name in the media?

fuck you all. fuck you if you think you can make lolita out to be the greatest love story of the century, if you think we need to shut up and get over it, if you think we need to stay silent because some asshole's movie about a teacher dating his quasi-teenage student is more important than the very real pain of countless human beings, fuck you if you think you can get off to recreation of my abuse. i have nothing but contempt for you all.",11
"they're letting him out of prison.. my father was supposed to be in prison until he died.

16 years to life in colorado. he served 18. he convinced the parole board that *he's sorry he'll never do it again.* paedophiles don't get better.

he was supposed to have charges pending in wyoming but the documentation and record of the report mysteriously disappeared and no one knows where everything went, and the victim has since become severely disabled and cannot credibly re-report because she can't talk or write.

someone had to sponsor his release since he has no money and they wouldn't have let him out just to be on the streets. i have no idea who would have done it, but i want to scream at them and tell them exactly who this monster is that they're setting free.

"my mom might be brain dead.. this post will be scattered, and absolutely deleted when i wake up.

monday, december 17, 2018, at around 3:40ish p.m, i had just grabbed my work clothes, and peered into my mom's room, to find her having a heart attack, or stroke, or.. something. doctors still aren't sure.

today, monday, december 24th, 2018, she is still not awake. she is diabetic. her kidneys aren't functional. she's on continuous dialysis. if she makes it through this, she absolutely will lose one or both feet. her lungs aren't working properly. today, she is supposed to have a test done to see if there is any brain activity. 
and, our landlord texted us. we are extremely late on rent. he is preparing eviction papers.
these last 7 days have felt.. unreal. like i'm in a dream, or an episode of a lame tv show.

it was so sudden. my mom hasn't been feeling well the last few months, but no matter how much i talked with her, how much i yelled, she would not go to the hospital.

i'm breaking. the last few months we have not gotten along at all. i said such horrible things to her. i want more than anything to go back to even last monday, and tell her i love her more than anything, and beg her to go to the hospital. i'm only 27. she is only 51. she is too young.

i can't lose my mom. i can't lose my mom. i've been having nightmares, i keep seeing her terrifying face, as she's gasping, gripping her chest, eyes staring to the right. i keep seeing her huge, bulging eyes with a vacant stare in the e.r. after they somewhat stabilized her. a machine breathing for her. hooked to so many tubes.

as absolutely pathetic as this is, i just want her to hold me and tell me everything is going to be okay. my mom is far from perfect, she is only human... but i will always and forever love her.

i want my mom.

happy holidays.

update: thank you to those who have read this, and have commented. an update.. the test shows there is damage. doctors don't know to what extent. if nothing changes by the weekend, we will have a very, very difficult decision to make. but it would honor her wishes. i don't know if i believe in god, or any afterlife, but i hope there is some sort of peace for my mother.
thank you.

update 2:  i can never express how grateful i am, and how loved i feel to you all who have read and commented on this. thank you. my heart and thoughts go out to each and every one of you. 
just... thank you. each and every one of your comments comforted me, and renewed a bit of hope and faith. honestly so many of the comments made me cry, overwhelmed from all the support and well wishes, as well as the ones with similar experiences. i promise you all, i am doing my  best staying strong. i have been breaking down the last couple days, since it's begun to sink in, but i know i will.. be okay.  i hope whoever you are, wherever you are reading this, you have a great day, even if you don't celebrate the current holidays!

edit: i want everyone to know i read every. single. comment. i am so grateful to each and every one of you offering your prayers. i can't wait to tell my mom how many people are thinking of her and praying for her! i also do plan on taking the advice to read this post to her. i know i keep repeating myself, but.. thank you. thank you for all the support.",11
"i stopped putting my mom as my emergency contact because i didn't want her to be the first notified when i killed myself. today i put her as my emergency contact again for the first time in years.. tw: abuse and suicide

from october 2015 to the end of june 2017 i was in a relationship with a horrifying man. he was a sadistic, sociopathic rapist who seemed to take special pleasure in driving me to kill myself. 

one night in april 2017 i told him i was going to kill myself with the bottle of pain killers we kept in the bathroom. i described exactly how i would, and i told him i'd do it with barbiturates but i couldn't afford them so i was going to swallow the bottle of painkillers instead. i told him i was going to do it tonight and that he needed to contact my therapist immediately. he shoved me, shouted ""jesus christ"", and then went to go play video games with our roommate. they turned the volume as high as it could go but i could still hear them laughing. i didn't take the pills. my best friend talked me out of it. i fell asleep but woke up multiple times that night to my ex biting me as hard as he could. i still had bite marks the next day. when i asked him why he bit me, he told me, ""i thought you killed yourself. i was checking if you were still alive."" 

that was when i knew he wanted me dead. 

i was suicidal long before that night and until the end of our relationship. even after i left him, i would have episodes where i would figure out what pills i had in the house and then look up how long it would take for me to die from swallowing all of them. i also looked up how much of a mess it would make. i didn't want my roommates to have to clean up a room full of shit and vomit after the paramedics put me in a body bag. that usually happened when i screwed something up. but i haven't had an episode like that since november. 

during this time, whenever i had to fill out emergency contact information on anything, i would never put anyone in my family. my mom had always been my emergency contact up until this time. but i stopped putting her on there. before i was born, she lost my half brother when he was two years old. her mom, my grandmother, put him in bed for a nap one morning and he never woke up. my mom's the one who found his body. no one comforted her and everyone blamed her, even though his death wasn't anyone's fault. 

i didn't want my mom to have to relive that. i didn't want her to be the first person in the world who knew i was dead. i knew she would have to find out eventually, but i wanted her to find out from someone who loves her. not from a stranger. 

but today i was filling out an application for a master's in law program, and i just finished filling out the emergency contact information when i realized i put my mom's name down. i realized it's been a long time since i wanted to kill myself. i'm not actively worried anymore of her being told that i died because, short of some accident, that's not a likely possibility. 

i just wanted to put this out there. ",11
"i started working at a jail and have met the worst people i have ever known. they aren't the inmates.. i got a job working as a corrections officer about 2 months ago. i love my job. every day is different, there's always something to do, and i'm learning a lot. but some of my coworkers are sucking all the joy out of my new job. 

i became a jailer because i wanted to protect the rights and well being of a class of people often overlooked. i wanted to make a difference. every day, i do my best to be kind to my inmates. i smile and tell them good morning. i ask them how they're doing if they seem upset. i'll bring them a book from the library, even if it's not their assigned day to ask for books. i'll bring them pictures of loved ones out of their property locker when they ask me for it, even when i have a million other things to do, even when it means skipping the only break i have. i do all this because i believe in the power of an act of kindness. i believe that all people deserve respect and love, regardless of their actions. 

in my short time at the jail, i've been told by an inmate that i ""made him feel human again."" i've had an innate, tears streaming down her face, tell me that ""she could see my heart."" i've been thanked for being kind and told that i'm appreciated. i guess it's possible that some of these compliments are manipulative, but i choose to believe in them. 

but my coworkers. one in particular, who is a control room officer. she sits in a secured area and opens doors for me, and also hands me requested items through a small window. she is so jaded. she is mean and spiteful and it hurts my heart so much. an inmate who i've seen grimacing in pain all day will respectfully ask me for an aspirin, and my coworker won't allow me to give it because, ""i don't like that inmate, he can wait."" an inmate who has seemed depressed all week will finally drag himself out of bed and ask me for soap so he can take a shower, but my coworker will say, ""i don't feel like getting him soap right now, make him wait an hour or two for annoying me."" 

every polite request is met with an eye roll and an attitude. she complains every day that the inmates are ""annoying"" and ""too needy"" but all i can think is ""that our job."" our job is to take care of them. we're here to bring them soap and medicine. we're here to keep them warm and safe. 

i hate her. i hate her for taking out her lack of patience out on my inmates. i hate her for making me look bad when she denies them something for a non-reason. and to be honest, i've started to tell the inmates, ""i'm sorry, *coworker* said you can't have what you asked for. i don't know why."" 

she shouldn't be a co. she has no compassion. she has no patience. she has no desire to help these people. her only desire is to pass judgement and play god by denying them simple requests and punishing them in her own way for their alleged crimes. 

i believe in kindness and smiles. i have looked murderers and child rapists in the eye and still seen some good in them. but all i see when i look at her is hate and spite. 

and i am so, so scared that one day, this job is going to turn my in to her. i am so scared. ",11
"as a father of 4, i have failed. as i sit here writing this i am half tempted to stop. why? i ask myself, what is this going to solve? but for some reason typing this and facing this makes it hurt less.  i have four children ages 11, 7, and twin boys who are 3.  this year has been absolutely miserable.  after living with my girlfriends parents for years to get on our feet we did it at the beginning of this year.  

i was promised a promotion at work which would bring in much more money and we could live comfortably, however that did not happen.  my brother was murdered in a rite-aid a few months ago, i suffered a broken leg and missed work for a month, and our bills fell behind and i fell into a deep depression.  

i have been paying rent, but late every month.  often times not being paid until the 15th of the month.  i hate having to sacrifice paying either the power or water bill, or just not getting gas in the car for the week.  christmas is now here, and my kids are asking me why we don't have a christmas tree? how am i supposed to tell them that we can't afford one?

i have sold all of my stuff worth of any value to be able to pay some bills and i have nothing left.  my power is due to be cut off on december 10 because of a $400.00 past due balance, my water is due to be cut off december 10th as well due to $120.00 past due.  and of course all this comes full circle in december.  

i just got off the phone with my landlord asking in a not so happy tone when the rest of decembers rent would be paid.  i feel like a complete and utter failure.  it pains me to my core, and nothing hurts more than seeing my kids go without.  i honestly don't think i can bare to look into their eyes on christmas morning, and what i will say.  

or what i will say on monday when we have no power or water.  i am working two minimum wage jobs, and their mother is working full time as well, yet we are barely scraping by and can't get caught up because of the month with no income.  if there was only a way to get caught up we would be ok.  but playing catch up with past due balances in coming full circle.

i just wanted to vent, and perhaps cry a little, for the pain i feel for my kids.  i hate myself that i could of not done better, or i could have a better job with more income.  i am supposed to be a father and a provider and i can't even do that.  i am dreading christmas morning, and wish i can just escape all of this.  

**update: power bill almost completely paid up, and water bill paid in full. (http://i.imgur.com/piaxz.jpg) you are all amazing great people!!!**

**update 2: thank you all!!!! the compassion is beyond amazing. just a fyi almost all extra gifts, and some of the high priced items on the wish list will be going to my brothers family, my brother was murdered a couple months ago, as well as some of the money. i will also be paying all this extra generosity to others who need it around me as well. pictures will be posted for proof. your all amazing and many tears have been shed today**

**update 3: honestly everyone, this is beyond amazing. please please help others who are on here needing assistance with bills and toys.  again - all extra money and toys will be going to others so i can spread your love.  please please help others out here who need it now, let's make this a night amazing for others as well. thank  you for everything.**

**update 4: i see i am  getting a lot of hate now, but i am blown away by all of this. so please if you were one of the people posting on here about how you need help please pm your info and let me help you now.  i have lots of extra toys and money to help pay some bills. for the final time all this extra compassion will be put to use to make this holiday just as good for somebody else, so please let me help now the best i can, please please donate to others now!! we are beyond blessed at this point.  let's make this an awesome one for others too!!**

**update 5: final update: thank you all again. i honestly can't say that enough i hope i helped some other people out as well. i need to get home and go to bed as i got work at 5am.  please no more donations you have all done so much already.  i am eternally grateful to all of you.  pictures will be posted of christmas and the gifts i have helped others with.  goodnight and thank you.**

**one last update: i am trying my best to go through all of the submissions for help.  as of this morning over $1,800 dollars has gone to helping others with power bills, toys, car repairs, food money, and etc. donations are also being made to a local community outreach center that helps with utilities and other hardships.  to answer just a few questions. people are skimming my pasts posts regarding me purchasing turn tables, records, and etc.  99% percent of those items were purchased at thrift stores and yard sales for pennies on the dollar.  that money came from many of the side jobs i do for extra cash, and everything that was posted was sold well over 6-8 weeks ago.

the reason i kept adding to the wish list was for the benefit of others that i know from my place of employment, in the neighborhood, and others who are need that can benefit from the kindness of others. the higher priced items that were added was in part from my daughter sitting in during my phone calls as i told her ""add some stuff your brothers and other kids would like"", she is a kid she didn't know any better.  

i am at work on break but i am trying to fill as many christmas wishes with verification as possible, if i don't respond or can't help out i am sorry, i am trying everything i can.  the indiegogo is in the process of being hidden.  once opened they will not close it once donations have been made, but they can ""hide"" it so no more donations will be made.  i sent the request by e-mail last night and i am hoping it will be taken down. for those sending negative hate, threatening e-mails and messages, and even death threats, please put that negative energy into helping others.  for everybody that donated and contributed, and sending positive message and vibes i thank you from the bottom of my heart.  you are all wonderful people.  pictures will be post once the holiday nears of others receiving goods, and etc.  thank you and happy holidays to all of you**",11
"you died today.. i met you 10 years ago when i started work as a teller at the bank. you were the first one to treat me like a real person and not like the nuisance-new-girl. you showed me the ropes and took me under your wing, and i love you for that, because starting a new job is already nerve racking as it is.

who would have guessed that you would become my best friend?

you, me, and jennifer shared our entire lives together behind that teller line---we did spend more time with each other at work than with our own families, after all. 

i remember the time the drunk man came in. we rock-paper-scissored it to decide who had to wait on him. i lost (of course!). we had just gotten the new instant messaging system on our computers that allowed us to send private messages to each other. when drunk man approached my teller window, jennifer sent us both an im that said ""oh hell!"" and we lost it. it's like when you're at a funeral and you get the uncontrollable urge to laugh, even though there's absolutely nothing to laugh about. i'm surprised i didn't get fired. you got to go hide in the break room! 

then your first date with daniel, the funeral home guy. your first date involved riding in his hearse. he told you he just had to transport a body to the funeral home and then you guys could go out, and you reluctantly agreed to ride with him. ten minutes into your trip, he had to slam on the brakes and the dead person+coffin comes flying into the front of the vehicle. i have marked that down as one of the hardest laughs i have ever had in my life, to date. 

oh, and then there was the time i slammed my thumb in my car door and you performed surgery on me in the bank bathroom.

the time i got in a fight with my then-boyfriend and you came to my rescue.

it has been seven years since we worked at the bank.

seven years ago you went to the doctor for the 100th time and they diagnosed you with lupus.
fast forward a few years and your liver started failing. then you tripped over your cat and fell and broke your hip. i'm sorry i gave you so much shit about that, but come on...you were 31 years old and you fell and broke your hip and had to have a hip replacement!

you went to a doctor in texas and got on a liver transplant list. in january 2018 you found out you were one of the next in line to get a new liver.

on tuesday of this week you were admitted to the hospital and put in icu because you had an infection in your blood.

on wednesday your body went into shock and your organs began failing.

on thursday at 12:22 p.m. you were pronounced dead. 

your 15-year-old son just messaged me on facebook **to see how i was doing.**

his mother just died, and he is checking on me. i hope you saw that, and saw how great of a kid you've raised. 

i'm at a loss right now. i've picked up my phone about 100 times to text you and then realized you were no longer there, and i've found myself wishing i was with you instead of here.

you were my best friend. i'll hold down the fort here until i see you again. 

edit: wow. i am blown away by all of your support. what started as me sipping on my third glass of wine and writing this just to get it off my chest turned into an overwhelming amount of support from all of you. i've cried on and off all day reading your comments and your stories. i love all of you, thank you so much. and i will keep in touch with her son to make sure he's okay.

"i secretly interviewed at a rival bar and i cant wait to quit on my asshole boss. **uddate 2***
i got the fucking job guys thanks again for the support****
*update : thank you guys for all the support im amazed by all the good wishes and positive vibes i will post on this thread as soon as i quit i literally cant wait!!! also i will tell you guys the name of the bar after i quit lol again thank you guys all so much 💛💛💛****
my boss is not your typical aashole. recently he's been accusing me of money laundering each time i make a tip bigger than $20. i find it very insulting. im also one of two employees so i am always there like 6 days a week and if he springs a double shift on me with no warning i have no choice to take it or i will be fired. he's also done several racist things too. just not a good guy.
    soooo i had enough. tired of crying over work and the way im treated. few nights ago i had an interview at one of the coolest music venues in houston and i think it went really well. im not very religious but i am praying i get this. mainly so i can go off on my current boss and see him panic to find another employee who would put up with all his bullshit.

"i just paid off my first student loan!. i graduated this past may, and have a history of struggling with money (i was disowned while in college). today, i paid off one of my student loans in full (around $7500)! i don't want to bring it up to my friends (a lot of them are still in school or living at home post grad), but i'm really happy and excited! it's been a lot of budgeting and stress, but i feel like i'm in a really good spot going forward.

edit: wow this blew up way more than i thought. thank you all for the kind words and wishes! still a long road to go ($~65,000 after this loan i believe), but i'm hoping that i can make as much progress as possible and pay it off in under 5 years.

someone also asked below for advice on how i was able to pay off my loans, so if you are looking for pretty straightforward tips that i found effective, that comment can be found in the thread below.

thanks again!",11
"the love of my life left for vacation and returned engaged to someone who ""identifies as a vampire"". of course i've shed countless tears over this, but i'd be lying if i said i didn't get a few laughs out of the pure absurdity of this situation.

when this happened, i had been dating my boyfriend, whom i will refer to as adam, for three years, and we'd been living together for a year and a half. this relationship had been incredible. we met in college and have many of the same interests. we have so much fun together and he's ridiculously sweet. i mean, i really, really loved this guy. i am head over heels for him, and people are always telling me that he is for me, too. well, they used to. 

adam decided to go on a trip to a city across the country for his friend's wedding. i was invited, but couldn't come because i couldn't get work off.

everything was totally fine before him leaving. we had a lovely night having a picnic and skinny dipping in a lake before he left. 

adam's texts became increasingly terse, and then, 6 days later, when he was supposed to come home, he began making weird excuses as to why he needed to extend the trip.

his texts became further and further between until i finally just asked what was up. he told me he had met someone else. i was shocked and obviously crushed.

a few days later, i see on facebook that adam is engaged. after less than two weeks. i look to see who he's engaged to, and...

it's a person with a gender-neutral name from middle english that kind of sounds like something that would be out of twilight or something. i'm not creative, so i guess the fake name i'll give this person is ""batty"". trust me, it was that ridiculous.

batty's profile said vhey went by the pronouns ""vey/vem"" because vhey ""have been identifying as a vamp since 2016"". i didn't ask, but judging by the gender-neutral name and appearance, i think this is a non-binary vampire.

i'm going to be honest, i began to suspect this vampire person was holding adam hostage or something. maybe i just didn't want to face rejection, but it was so goddamned out of the blue and out of character. 

adam did eventually come back to say goodbye and pack his things before moving back to be with batty. i met up with him and asked him wtf was going on, and yes to be honest i was sort of like ""did you get kidnapped? do you need me to call the police?"" 

adam was apologetic but told me he just immediately fell in love with batty. that ve was so brilliant and had this beautiful soul and he knew they were soulmates.

so.....yep. can't wait to see pictures of the wedding, i wonder if there will be coffins and bats.",11
"sometimes i upvote a post to let the op know they're not alone.. i find myself up-voting people's posts, even when no one else has. mainly because in subs like this, sometimes it takes a lot for someone to admit something they've been holding in for hours, days, or even years.

i like to think that seeing the ""2"" sitting off to the left lets them know that someone cares...

i just want them to know that they're never alone.

edit: oh my gosh, y'all are so amazing! i wasn't expecting this many people to react and support this!! every little thing we can do to help each other out, should be done without a second thought. 

it makes me beyond happy to see that i'm not the only one that does this! keep supporting and lifting others up instead of down 💕",11
"for the person scrolling,. you, you're important. you know that? i'm so proud of you for still being here. right now, it might seem impossible to get through the day without shutting down and going back to bed again. i know, i just know, one day, you'll be looking forward to getting up and even the day after. who knows, it might be a certain someone who changed that, or something, or anything, but it will happen. some things won't go your way, but you can get through it, beat that shit and don't let it get to you, be it someone who's always let you down, or something that just keeps popping up in your head, or even the table that you accidentally stubbed your toe on. whatever it is, you can get through it. smile, cry, talk, write it out, anything. treat yourself once in a while, manicures, pedicures, a new video game, new clothes, or that one cookie that always caught your eyes. 


if no one's ever said this to you, i'm super proud of you, i'm happy you're here, you look incredibly good today, i love that smile of yours, and i'm here for you and i love you. people make mistakes, no one's perfect, own up to your mistakes and forgive yourself. i mean all that, it was hard for me to wake up too, it was so hard to get through the day without going back home and locking myself in my room. i understand, i've made many mistakes and lost a lot of close friends. i know it's hard when everything comes at once, it's overwhelming, but you can do it. you have the potential to. 


if you need someone to talk to, i'm here. i'll always be here, always. i'll try my best to help you through it, i might not be able to give the best advice, but i'll listen to everything you have to say. whatever it is, i'll listen and support you. cuz it feels better to let it out, rather than keeping it in all the time. you can call me or text me, i'll listen. you're important, every single one of you out there, you don't know me and i don't know you, but you mean a lot and i want to help. i love seeing everyone smiling, so i don't care if we don't know each other, i just want to help, even in the smallest way possible. i love you.  you can get through it. good job, and you look incredible today and everyday.

"i went to planned parenthood today. i grew up in the very religious south, so you can infer my upbringing was very much in line with the expectations when you read that phrase. my parents were rural farmers, so as you can imagine, i don't really come from much, and it seems like the poorer we were the more religious my parents behaved. 

i grew up to reject much of my family and community's beliefs and i pulled myself out of that place and i'm working on making something of myself. i'm currently 24 and working on a phd, trying to get my life together. i do many things that my parents don't agree with, but today may have taken the cake. 

i have recently had symptoms of pregnancy, even though i'm on birth control, so i scheduled an appointment at planned parenthood for pregnancy testing and to go over my options. i didn't go in thinking if i were pregnant that i would absolutely have an abortion, but i wanted a safe environment to weigh all the options. 

planned parenthood was everything they claim to be and more. safe, quiet, clean, judgment free, compassionate, and informational. i left with packets of resources and a calm feeling for once. 

if my parents knew that i went to planned parenthood for anything, never mind that i didn't go in for an abortion (not looking to debate on your opinion of abortion, so don't start), i committed a cardinal sin simply by seeing qualified health professionals there. 

regardless of your socioeconomic status, no matter your background and religious upbringing, don't be afraid to seek help from qualified professionals like at planned parenthood. take care of yourself, your life belongs to you only. i took a big step today, i didn't let my family's beliefs bias my seeking medical care, neither should you.",11
