"[Super Awesome Update] Sat down on my friend's MacBook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.","I never thought this would turn out the way it did and I really felt like I learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

I went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.

I did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

I got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

She gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

If it weren't for you guys I would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

I feel good for following all the advice here.

"(Update) Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

I'm sad about this update for the kid, I took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because I had questions about an issue I'm having and briefly explained it.

Officer shows up, I invite him in and explain the whole situation. He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

We watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.

About 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.

The officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

After they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

I talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

I haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). I should have called them earlier once the CPS reports I was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.",legaladvice
I think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. He is a doctor.,"This is in north Texas. 

Hey so I must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. 

I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as… well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. 

I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. 

I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. I was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said I should be treating those sores. 

I had completely forgotten they were there. These little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. I got so freaked out he mentioned them that I decided to leave. 

The next day he came over to ""Check on me"" and I remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

Then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. I never agreed to me with him and would never want to. He does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something I have no memory of. 

I am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

This has started to affect my work life as well as I start to get paranoid when I see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. I get paranoid that they are about to fire me. My friends also state I have been acting strangely and out of character. I have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when I do.  

Is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? I do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so I want to be damn sure when I go to the police.

Neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive,"Male, late 20's, CO

I quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (I haven't consumed alcohol in years) and I replaced that habit with drinking Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Juice. The juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to Corona beer bottles. 
Here lies my issue:
This morning I was walking to my car from my apartment and I had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like ""The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE. This all just happened. I'm calling the cops. Any suggestions?

BTW, I didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. They said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

UPDATE:

The police showed up. As soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

UPDATE #2:

Both men were arrested and I will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. I will be talking to detectives. The police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ",legaladvice
"[UPDATE] [PA] I followed and reported a drunk driver, then I got a ticket for driving past curfew","This is an update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200B;

I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [""justification"" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)

Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.

The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!",legaladvice
"I told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.","I got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. I didn't tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.

He called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

We went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. 

There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. 

I should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of. I don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place I'm in now is way cleaner than I'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. They weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. They also weren't very happy with our house I could tell.

I hope we don't have to go back. And I hope it's ok to post this. Even tho I don't need advice anymore. Thank you to everyone who helped me.",legaladvice

Thanks to everyone's terrific advice, I got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to RAINN) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

Within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and I were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

One of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching I am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

Between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting I was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (I'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

The ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward.

"UPDATE: My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... I GOT CUSTODY!!!","**EDIT: per the bots request, I am required to tell you that I live in Washington (WA)**

[Here's my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

So after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my step sister.

I did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I've ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

After my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

After her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I've never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

Her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

Yesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

The past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision I've ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn't just DNA based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

Thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

I hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me.",legaladvice
My wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! I'm growing very worried,"Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

Title says it all. We've been married for 3 years now. She's always been one for quirky, ""against-the-grain"" thinking and interests. However, it's not just harmless things like believing there's no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in ""aesthetic poses"", or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there's this anti-vax bullshit. 

She got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she's worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. 

I love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She's refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

I know that in her mind, she's coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we've had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

""Oh well if you look this graph you'll see that the numbers of cases for <X disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <Y vaccine>""

""I'm the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I'm right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc..."" 

I've tried explaining to her the basic idea of ""correlation doesn't equal causation."" By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with ""We aren't talking about ice cream and murder, we're talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They're completely different!""

I've tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn't as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with ""Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and ""big-pharma""

She won't budge and hasn't budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I'm worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could've been easily avoided. 

I am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife's knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don't want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child.

Update to: Someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when I was underage and I'm terrified that I'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (Ohio),"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

So as the title states, last year I was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when I was 14/15. I thought I would update now that it's come to a resolution.

I went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

I panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

Long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.

Anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation. I really appreciate the advice I got here! Thank you again so much. ",legaladvice
"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case. I did nothing wrong.","Okay, so a few days ago I was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

I was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

So then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.

When he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and I was released.

What can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I'll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

EDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told ""good luck"". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.",legaladvice

Subaru Service center gave my car to someone else,"FINAL UPDATE

So I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. 

<EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

EDIT:

Thank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

FINAL UPDATE:
Hey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  Thanks again everyone!

So, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200B;

So, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200B;

Sorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

So, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.

(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

My brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.

During the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

Suffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

So, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.",legaladvice
My Daughter Disowned my Underage Grandson. What do I do?,"I posted in r/JustNoFamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. 


My sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. He travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. I found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first I'm hearing about it. 


I phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. She said some very nasty things. I honestly thought I raised her better than to act in such a manner. But my grandson doesn't want to go back home, I'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible.

[CO] My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. She now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. I want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.,"Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200B;

We have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200B;

Around this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200B;

Ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200B;

Turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using ""Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200B;

I'm pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn't know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged. I'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but I would like to know going in what to do. Thank you.",legaladvice
Little sister (16) needs an abortion. Texas wants parental consent which we can't get. Can I take her to New Mexico? (UPDATE: it's done),"https://redd.it/6m79kf

So it is done. We called an abortion clinic in New Mexico and asked for advice. They were very helpful. Scheduled an appointment.

I told my parents that I'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in New Mexico for 2 days. They never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. So in the morning I picked her up and we drove to New Mexico. We took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. Had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. Spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. She spent the day and that night at my place. I called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so I'll bring her there tomorrow.

She was feeling fine by then. So nothing suspicious at all. She's very happy this worked out the way it did and I'm happy that she's happy. I told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. You can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

Thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. Once we knew I won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",legaladvice
[Update] [MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm updating [my last post](https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

I did what you all told me to do. I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.

I was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

I said loudly ""I think you owe me an apology.""

She said ""yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.""

I said ""Yes, and another apology for saying I don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

She said ""I'm sorry"" and left.

The principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

I said ""It wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

So things are sorted out now. But also, I'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!",legaladvice
Update - My brother went missing 6 years ago. Police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? How do we get more information. Illinois.,"https://redd.it/74we5z

I talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. They found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. The officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

There days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed DNA samples to confirm. DNA confirmed it was him.

What happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). That was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. That's when they decided to... His friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). Recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

The officer says my brother didn't die in pain. It was multiple gunshots. You'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. We had a funeral for him. Now there's a place that I can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

I thank all of you who helped.

[UPDATE] Had a falling out with the girl I love and got served a cease and desist order. What can I legally do? [Michigan] (x-post on r/relationships),"Past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

Oh boy. I've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn't going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

For those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

First, I want to assure everyone that I didn't contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don't want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn't recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn't be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt's house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. 

After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. 

In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. I've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I'm sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.

**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.

**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn't expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. 
I wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn't reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. 

2. I didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I'm not sure why I did it, but I don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don't know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don't think.

4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real ""friends"" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say ""oh I'm perfect now so I can do what I want,"" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",legaladvice
Update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. I'm back after 6 months.,"You can read my old post here: [[Florida]: Parents hired people to kidnap me. My brother ended up pointing a gun at them. What do I need to do to get emancipated?](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I sadly don't have any good news. Just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. The camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

The place wasn't like anything I imagined it would be. I tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. They also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. Whatever you do they see it as resistance. Their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

Until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. Even when I was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. It took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that I'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. I got to the point that I didn't care about anything anymore, I just wanted it to end.

They knew about my YouTube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. They had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if I truly hate my old self or not. She'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also YouTuber) and I was supposed to agree with her, if I took things personally they knew I was acting and wasn't ready.

They got me when I was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. The next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. I was thinking all the time and effort I placed there was gone.

From there I didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. So things became easier. They'd teach me to be a nice girly Christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. It was like they were sending me into a children's book. Then my dad came and brought me back home.

When I got back my brother actually told me that my YouTube account wasn't deleted. Since I was using his email for recovery he got a notification when I logged in from the camp because it was a new place. So he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. So my account is intact. The assholes at the camp were lying.

I don't know if I'm the same person or not or how much I've changed but I really hate my parents. I hate them so much that a year ago I couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. There are 448 days until I'm 18 and I'm counting every single day until this is over and then I'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

My big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who I trust. When I was gone he went to police, CPS, even talked to a lawyer and a PI to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. My parents came after my $15,000 which I had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. But my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. He continued to post the videos that I had prepared in the pipeline when I was gone so I continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

That's it for me. From what I understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",legaladvice
Can I get a paternity test on myself?,"Hi, I'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents. I had a much older sister who killed herself when I was 6. She was 26 when she died. All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious. She got real mad at me and told me not to snoop and said she didn't have kids. Well I started thinking about it. I am the spitting image of my sister but I don't look like my mom or dad.

My mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. I've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. Recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". I say that in quotes because I have no fucking clue who they are.

I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. According to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. I've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but I've been unable too. They cut of the internet, phone and TV Tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. I'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way I've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy.

I'm at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

I'm so lost right now it makes me sick. I do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and I need to know what the fuck I can do here. Can I just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. If my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

Edit:

I talked to my mom and told her because I would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times I could see my friend I would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". I got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. He did not agree and was told I didn't want to talk to him.

He says that he is already looking into emergency custody (I want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great.

I have contacted amazon and UPS about their trucks crossing my property, UPS has instructed their drivers to no longer use that route, haven't heard a thing back from amazon yet but i have stopped two of their trucks so far,both of which were ticketed by the sheriffs dept and the one needing a tow to get pulled off the berm it got stuck on.

thank you all of you for the suggestions, hopefully soon this will all be over and i can get on with my life.",legaladvice

"GF's dad filled out her mail-in ballot, forged her signature, and sent her a photo of the completed ballot with the caption 'If anybody asks, you voted.'","My girlfriend was furious. Not only is this obviously illegal, but it's a huge breach in trust for my girlfriend and it totally defeats the purpose of voting for her, her  brother, and everybody else that this happens to. To be clear, my girlfriend and her parents DO NOT share political views, and they know that. 

I just want to know what action can be taken to potentially block the ballot from being counted and/or what can be done to press her father to understand that this is a serious crime and a clear breakdown of the Democratic system.

Edit: This is in Arizona.

Edit 2: We found out that the ballot has not been mailed yet. We are having her father send us the parcel instead of having him ""throw it out"" and risk it being submitted. The reason the ballot did not come to us is because he signed her up for early voting and put his address as the place to mail it. We live in a different city. ",legaladvice
[Update] I take prescription medication for ADHD. Started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. Company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. Left old job for new one and now I'm unemployed.,"Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

I am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

I met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don't want to sue anyone if I don't have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

Ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

I asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

Anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.

When I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.

He told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn't necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

So now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

Edit: I'm going to disclose my medication. I take Vyvanse. A lot of people assume I'm taking Adderall. I used to take Adderall but my doctor suggested I try Vyvanse when it came out. Although similar and made by the same company, Vyvanse is a much better medication for me. The release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as Adderall, my appetite is not affected, I sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that Adderall does when wearing off.

Ex-wife is suing me for child support. I don't even have a penis... (update),"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I have both good news and bad news.

The good news is that I won the battle with my ex. I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

The bad news is that, I'm dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I'm happy with the life I've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good. 

Thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. It helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. You could see from my comments on the original post that I was almost ready to give up. ",legaladvice
"(AZ) Our neighbors dog was poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). Wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. I say absolutely not. How should we proceed?","I guess some background is in order here. Earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. We were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 Our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. The next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. They did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. The next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. This all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

So they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. We tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

So we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. We have yet to contact the lawyer. 

We had made the initial report to animal control last Thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" I was really taken aback and I think I asked ""I think so, do you need some?"" 

He then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. I literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. I explained that I actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and I really have no way of knowing which dog is which). He said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" I got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


The officer then asked if he could take everything. I said I wasn't comfortable with that but I would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. I did exactly this. I was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. Again I was taken completely aback and said that I'm not sure what he'd be looking for. He told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. It took me as second but I asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. I asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if I remember) ""not yet."" 
I asked him if I could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. I said I would really rather not but I would get back in touch with him. He gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

I just got home and told my wife. My wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. We have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but I feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

She thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. I say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. I'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

Thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. Police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. Wife thinks we should let them, I say absolutely not.

>Edit: hey guys I'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in DM but it would sure be easier if I could just answer them once. I'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, I really don't want to say where I am and my attorneys name. All the laws I found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

So thank you to everyone who responded. And I guess thank you to everyone in the DMs who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, I want to sleep in my own house. Just to allay the fears of the other nice DM's, I did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. Also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

I took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on Monday night. I also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. I called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

He was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the DA actually pursuing this were slim to none. He did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, I could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. He said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


So basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as I type this) but I just heard (Wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. Basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. In fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. The people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. They also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all I know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people I've ever encountered). The can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). So with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

So our complaint to animal control from last Thursday is still on the books. The lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. Our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. The criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

"Cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing","I had purchased a used Cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic I knew. He said his son was driving it. When I first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of BHO oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. I threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
Flash forward to the other night and I was pulled over for an improper lane change. Officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when I was being pulled over. He asked to search the vehicle and which point I said no. Waited half an hour for the dog to show up. He alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  He checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. After his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. They cut into the leather seats. They also cut into my spare tire. Mind you, I have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. They cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. I'm obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. After this well over 2 hour ordeal, I was told I was free to go. When asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. Before I do that I would like to know if there's any better options and how I should pursue this. The seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there's so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what I probably would've payed for it. Not to mention they also ruined my spare. Thank you.

"Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","For the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

At first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

I've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

She will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

Numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

When she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.

Now I'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).

I just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I'm not home she could very well drown. That's why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

I've called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

I feel like I've done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I've debated calling the police when she enters but I don't know how that will escalate.",legaladvice

I watched the VHS tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. That's why he kept his savings in cash. He didn't even trust a safe deposit box. That's why they were kept in his walls. And it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. I found the other $20,000.

I went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. She talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

I scheduled an appointment with the bank. When I told them it's for a cash deposit they told me I don't need an appointment for that but I told them it's for a large deposit. They still said no appointment is necessary, but then I said it's a very large deposit. So they booked the appointment. Everything went smoothly at the bank. They made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. Money was in my account a few hours later.

I made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and I now have a larger emergency fund.

I posted this 2 weeks ago and a lot has happened. Something happened before I could go any further with the lawyer I spoke to.

The Monday following the incident I was asked to come speak with a VP of HR I'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. When I walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which I was told was part of legal. What I didn't realize, is my friend who I mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though I told him to keep it secret). This information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. I was asked to explain exactly what happened, who I told, and asked a lot of questions. Everything I said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when I told them I was in touch with a lawyer. They had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

This is the holy shit part. They say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt I would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if I wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. They also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. I took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. BTW I'm not stupid, I know they did this so I wouldn't take any legal action against them, but I love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. I also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

There's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and I finally have an office with a door I can actually close! I'm in the field a lot less now, so I guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now I don't interact face to face nearly as much as I used

[Update] [Iowa] City threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors,"This is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

Hello r/legaladvice,

A few months ago I posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town I live in sent a letter demanding that I take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. Most of the comments I received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my First Amendment rights, and yes, I should seek a lawyer. 

So I did so. I set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. However, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended I speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

Skipping over unnecessary details, I met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. I updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

Once I updated the website and the city realized I wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. I went, although now I realize I probably should not have done so. He was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought I should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. He also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think I should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. I declined the interview, because I was afraid I'd get sued (whether justified or not) if I said something the city didn't like.

Of course, I was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. So she ran her story, and I was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. What's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. They were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

A few weeks later I received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. It was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several Iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. He told me I was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. The letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

This was around mid-January, 2018 (I received the first letter mid-December, 2017). Everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until I got an email from the legal director at the ACLU of Iowa. On the advice of Reddit, I had emailed both the ACLU and the EFF, but after over a month with no response I had figured they were too busy to look at my case. I was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

I spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the ACLU of Iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. Toward the end of February we filed suit in Federal court, and by March 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. They had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content I produce regarding the town.
2. They must pay legal damages to me.
3. They must pay attorney fees to the ACLU.
4. They must write an apology letter to me.
5. My favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take First Amendment training.

All in all, I'm incredibly impressed with the ACLU's work on this case. I know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but I think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were.

[Update] My landlord shut off the electricity in the middle of a heat wave,"Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cg42cd/my_landlord_shut_off_the_electricity_in_the/

This happened in NY.

I'd like to thank everyone who replied to that post. It was very helpful.

After the post my SO and I decided to get a hotel. When we came back this morning the power was back on. My neighbor told me what happened:

Shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). The firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. Long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

The poor kid's parents have already begun complaints to the relevant authorities. I'll be meeting a lawyer tomorrow about breaking my lease.",legaladvice
My daughter was bit by a raccoon with rabies. My wife does not want to give our daughter the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am taking her tonight to a hospital against my wifes wishes in secret.,"My daughter was playing with a wild raccoon last night and got bit. I killed a raccoon in the area foaming at the mouth. Not sure if its the same one but refuse to take the chance. 

My wife vehemently refused the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am in panic mode and I am taking her to a hospital over 50 miles away near Dallas. 

Can I kidnap my own daughter? There is not a custody agreement in place because we are married and not separated. Probably will be soon though. 

I need to know what to watch out for here and what to say to police if I get stopped. Rabies is fatal so I am not playing with this one. 

I am leaving here in 10 minutes so just need to know a few things. 

Is it kidnapping in this case?

Will I be arrested? 

What do I do if she calls in an amber alert?

I am desperate.",legaladvice
(UPDATE) NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/)

I went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. She took one look at the letter from my friend Aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

She contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me Aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if I heard more otherwise no need for more action.

Aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. He wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. I hadn't complained to them myself so I did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

Update - Dog Ate Neighbor's Drone,"*Edit: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

A small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

I was served a summons by a Sheriff's Deputy, neighbor decided to take me to Small Claims over his drone. My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. 

He also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). I don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they're investigating but don't know anything else. Not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

I brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do"". Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. In the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). He is also banned from flying over my property, and I installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. He seems pretty upset with me, so I wanted to be careful. 

The only thing that could make this better is if the FAA finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",legaladvice
Doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. I'm 22 and no longer even live with her.,"Background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. My GP who I have seen since I was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. I moved away for college when I was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new GP and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since I've seen him half my life. 

I get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication I take to make sure that I'm not getting too little/too much. The results of this information or the fact that I have those tests done isn't a big secret I want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless I were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

The first time I had this work done, I hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. They even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/mL the medication level was. Again, it's not like to my mother this is anything I want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and I never received any call about my results. I go in for these monthly, so the next month that I went I told the woman working in the lab of the office that I wanted to update my information to make sure I got the results (I thought also since I had been seeing this doctor since I was 10 I probably had never given them my phone number). A few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; I again got no call from the office. Once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when I explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, I was a little tipped off that I wasn't called again. I chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

At this visit I had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. He asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. I wasn't worried that I was pregnant, but I knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. I asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. It did, so on my way out I stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that I and I alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. They nonchalantly agreed and I asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. I happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. My mom BLEW UP at me asking why I needed to take a pregnancy test (I didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). That all blew over, but at this point I was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

I ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of HIPAA and she knows it after working in a hospital. She laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since I was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - I'm your mom!""

Since then, I've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. To no surprise there are no issues. I don't really know what to do here. Since I cut ties with that doctor, I no longer have personal problems with this, but I'm sure other people do without even knowing it. I don't have resources really for a lawyer. I might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. So how serious is it really?

Mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that I said I don't want to pay,"So my parents are heavily Mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if I had paid my tithing I told them no. They then asked me if I had a plan to fix that and I told them that I worked too hard just to give that money away.

Anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as I am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

This isn't legal right?

*Update: I plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. I will leave some in as to not look suspicious. I will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*Update 2: Ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

Turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. He's stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. My mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. She said she'll give me the rest back and that she's still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. I'm at a loss what to do next.

*Update 3: Doesn't sound like I'm getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. My mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. My dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. 

I'm still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can't touch it. Just in case they get any ideas.",legaladvice
[CO] My retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. I fear that she intends to abuse other children and I want to stop it. I have proof of her abuse against me. How do I go about this?,"Between the ages of 9-11, I took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. If memory serves, I believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that I took lessons with her. The only reason I stopped going to her was because she retired. 

My teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". I won't get into specifics, but I have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

I never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

Recently, I found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. I am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and I want to stop it before it's too late.

So my question is: legally, what can I do and what should my course of action be? I don't want money, I just want her stopped.

I have the photographs, but I am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

Please walk me through this, because I genuinely don't know what to do, and I'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because I didn't stop it sooner.

"UPDATE Neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. Now she's trying to sue me. We're the ones with 29k in medical bills. NC USA","Here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=JSCE6BW3&sh=7f56780f


My sister and I spent the weekend after I posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
The guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
He is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

Ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

The neighbors mean dog has been put down.  She was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

We've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

Our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

She was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
One from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  I'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

One for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

Her lawsuit against me has a court date of March 5th.  After she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   She then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

She finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

Our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in NC where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

Now for some extra facts. 

My left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on February 27th. 

Our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  The vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  She still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

The destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

The day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  She broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  She straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  She also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

We called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. They asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

Our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

The video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  It shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. It also shows her audibly laughing during it. She only started trying to help when I started smashing her dog into the ground. 

We also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the HOA. 

He said it's pointless to go after the HOA and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  Our lawyer did tell us that the HOA has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

There was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

I honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

Either way, my sister and I both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of March. 

Thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. You guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

I'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer whatever I can.

I went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too.

The owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. The girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said I felt that I needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. My parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs.

I really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn I was wrong. Like I said I'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, I didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too.

I've decided not to press charges, I don't really have the money/time for it, and all I needed was my medical expenses paid. I just plan on not going to any family gatherings where he is for a long long LONG time.

A former Air BnB guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (Texas),"Its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  One guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  A lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  One lady missed the receipt of a Death Certificate.  We thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  So I tried calling the USPS and that got me nowhere.  Going down in person was the only way to do this I guess.  Turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal PO Box?  Who knows.  The post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  Still, how could this have happened?  Surely this can't be legal.  I got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  She hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

Edit:  Well that was quick~!  The Post Office called me directly before I could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  They're very certain what she did is illegal.  Thanks /u/BeamDriver for the advice!

Can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?,"Yesterday my phone was stolen at lunch and I chased down the girl who stole it making a scene in the mall. A Plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.

The girl tried to say I was trying to steal her phone. I told the officer that I could unlock the phone and the girl could not, I told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. 

He refused to give me the chance or believe me. He told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. 

I left. 

The girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so I decided to check back 2 hours later. I saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. 

When no one was in her store and her back was turned I took my phone back. 

Before anyone starts going off on me for it, I know. I know exactly what I did was extremely stupid but I am still paying for that phone so...yeah. 

I am asking for the legalities of it.

The phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. 

The place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that I am on video. My questions are simply did I break any laws?

If the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and I was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did I break the law?

EDIT: Thanks for all of the info. I do not wish to pursue a police complaint nor do I wish to report the crime. I am too lazy for that.

[Update] Girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. I don't. What are my rights? (Texas),"[This is my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

Short version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

Long version:

If you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.

She really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.

The childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

So I have my baby daughter!

Taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job! 

As most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.

Thank you all. ",legaladvice

So in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""Good luck with the mortgage and bills, I've taken MY money out of our bank account and turned off your card on MY credit"".

I obviously need an attorney, I logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. What resources can I begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until I can find childcare and a job? Is there anything I can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney?

It didn't take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound.

In the end my dad made it so I would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. I stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. My mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: My step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month I was coming no matter what. 

&#x200B;

After a week of this, everything changed. My mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. Me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. My sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. During this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  After this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200B;

She proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". All to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand I was being used by evil.""During these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn I was."" According to her I am a ""evil seed"" and that I not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". I also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. She told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. She ended by telling me that I was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". The last contact I know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

At the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. I moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then.

"[ON] I caught my neighbors son stealing my underwear/other things. Family refuses to believe me or my landlord, and is threatening to sue me for slander. What can i do? - UPDATE","My original post is here: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ayhlsu/on_i_caught_my_neighbors_son_stealing_my/)

Thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

A long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. Thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. No one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

Anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. I told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). So the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

I am satisfied i guess, the entire situation seems extremely uncomfortable and akward. ",legaladvice
Dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. How do I protect myself legally?,"I have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. A few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

The last few months have been hell. They have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. They are loud way past our community quiet hours. They have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). I have recorded it. It wakes up my 2 year old. Do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

They leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. It has ruined my outdoor rug. I took pictures. 

They drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

They regularly park in the reserved spot I pay for monthly. It is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. They are an extra $50 a month. The minute I leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until I threaten to involve the apt. Manager.

They have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

They like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. I have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. It ruined my potted plants outside. 

I have reported all the incidents. I have tried to ask them to cut it out. They don't care. 

I recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out I am not the first to complain that day. The police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (I am not sure of how it was found. I stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

Since then they have taken to recording me any time I leave my apartment. They have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

The woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how I am impeding her ability to exist in public because I am racist. She says I call the police on her for doing nothing. I only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

I understand I am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. I would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

I just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot I pay for monthly, and play loud music I can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

She had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

They have really upped the bleach game too. It has gotten on a few spots on my door and I am scared they might throw it at my car. 

I have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. I can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

I can't lose my job and I am not sure how protect myself legally. 

They are actually my paid space right now but I am scared to have them towed because I don't know what they are going to do. I pay for that space. I have proof. The sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

If I tell the apartment they will have the car towed but I'll look like a racist. 

All it takes is one video and a lie and I am ruined. 

I want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but I think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that I pay for is reasonable. But maybe not?",legaladvice
Boyfriend and I slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. Landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out,"This happened in Ontario, Canada.

So this past Friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

I found out about it the next night at work (I work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and I were the night before. He filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

For more context, on the 24th of October a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. It has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (I sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

All we asked for was the alarm for our unit. Luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

Boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

I dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. My dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. But I don't know. Came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in Ontario. 

EDIT: More direct questions; should we pursue action and report? If we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? I know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. I could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

TLDR: Boyfriend and I were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

Caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result,"I went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while I was away. I came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. My oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. I thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. Took her to the ICU and the doctor ran a lot of tests. The doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. She was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. This caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. She suffered for two days in the ICU before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. There was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. I stayed by her side as they euthanized her. That was about 3 days ago. My heart is in pieces. 
There is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. But I have text messages of when I tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

I know I'm angry and grieving. But because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until I had to let her go.

"Son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.","This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him. 

We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

Once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". Okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""Do not worry! This won't happen again"". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers not parents.""

We have no issues for a while until this week. Some parent brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.

We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.",legaladvice
Neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard,"Update: I'll be sure to post updates so please stop PMing me or replying to my comments/post history outside of this sub asking me to do so or suggesting I shit-bomb them back. 

My wife noted that what we think might be his kid comes around most weekends. In the interest of remaining neighborly and with the possibility neighbor dude might be losing his mind, we're going to talk with them before lawyering up or involving the fuzz. Updates forthcoming.

Original post:
Hey all, I have a shitty situation here that I'm hoping to get some advice about. This is in Idaho.

&#x200B;

My neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. A new neighbor bought a house across the street about 6 months ago. A few weeks back, I was working in the garage when I saw him take his dog directly across the street, into my front yard. He let it pee in my yard and then walked straight home. He didn't notice me  - my garage is set up as a shop and is pretty busy, and the garage door is up a lot - but this piqued my interest because it's goddamned weird. Now, my wife and I have a dog so there are a few dog droppings from her that we pick up on a regular basis. My wife had been doing the dooty duty recently, so I asked her if there are more piles than normal. Sure enough, she said there had been a ton for a while now. She figured it was assholes walking their dogs and letting them crap in our lawn. I figured it was our new weirdo neighbor.

&#x200B;

It happened again around a week later: I was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. This time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. I called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  I went across the street and knocked on his door. He didn't answer. We set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and I kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so I could talk to him.

&#x200B;

I reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. Why our yard? No clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. The next time I saw him walking to his car, I confronted him. I simply told him that I knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if I caught him doing it again I'd call the police to report him for trespassing. He denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200B;

So I review the footage from the last few days. Dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. He then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. What the absolute fuck.

"(update) [Nebraska] I just closed on a new house, sellers allege that I owe a portion of their 990$ security system cancellation fee because I did not take over their contract. Threatening small claims court.","https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9h80ot/nebraska_i_just_closed_on_a_new_house_sellers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

Thank you to all of the people who commented on the original thread. This was my first time dealing with small claims court and all of the helpful advice and information really helped set me up for success.


So, short story is that the sellers did end up taking me to court for roughly $1,400. This was for the total cost of the contract buy out for their security system, travel expenses since they moved out of state and would need to pay for gas and lodging to come back to sue us, as well as court costs. 


Small claims court was surprisingly straight forward and informal. I've never been a big talker, but I honestly don't think I was able to say more than three words at a time without the plaintiff interrupting me. The judge eventually asked her to please stand in the hall way so I could speak my side fully. She absolutely refused to leave, but did stay quiet for a short minute so I could say that I never agreed to take over her security contract, and there was no documentation to suggest that I did.


The judge agreed and ended up ruling in my favor. I thought it was done there but the plaintiff swiftly appealed the decision. So now we had a new court date early this month with a different judge. 


During this time the plaintiff continues to send me hostile emails and voice messages. The seller's broker (their realtors boss) called me while I was at work to tell me he was very displeased I filed a formal complaint against his realtor. He told me I was not welcome to pursue any future business with his company, and I assured him the feeling was mutual. The broker said he supports all of his realtors and will not be acting on the complaint in any way. So I went and talked to the mayor's office about the situation. The mayor asked me what I wanted out of this, and I showed him the hostile emails from the seller and told him I felt it was the realtor's job to act as an in-between, even after the sell was complete. The mayor said he would step in and speak with the broker. (This is a fairly small town, they probably already knew each other). 


I never heard from the seller again after that, thanks mayor. So now it comes time for round 2 in small claims court. The new judge goes through and reads the write up from round 1 and asked the plaintiff if there is new evidence or information that has not been covered. Long story short, there was not. The judge ended up sustaining the previous ruling in my favor, and strongly advised the plaintiff not to appeal unless there is new evidence or information that has not been seen by the court.


It's been five days and no word on an appeal so I think it's safe to say I'm finally done and ready to put this whole ugly thing behind me. Once again thank you to all of you who helped me on the original thread. I'm very pleased that resources like this community exist.


On a final note, gossip, but I got a call from the mayor at 2am the night before last because there was a house fire down the street from me. (The mayor and I know each other well). So I went to go help the volunteer fire brigade put it out. We got it under control and we were winding down when a deputy from the sheriff's office comes to tell me that the lady who sued me waited around the court building the day of the appeal for the judge to get off, then tried to confront him about the ruling in the courthouse parking lot. I didn't really care to hear about it, but it sounds like she's in some pretty deep shit now. Kind of cathartic.


TL;DR: They lost and I think it's finally over.

EDIT: thank you for all of the very kind and thoughtful messages! To clarify some common questions, the ruling stipulated that the plaintiff pays all court costs, including my own. Yes, I could probably countersue, but I'm very interested in dealing with the seller and broker as little as possible for the rest of my life. :)

Please do not take this post as a representation of Nebraska, most people here are actually quite nice. There's a couple rotten apples in every bunch.",legaladvice
Police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while I was asleep,"This has been a really weird morning... not sure if I chose the correct flair

I have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

At 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z's). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

He asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops leave I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

So now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

I have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. The cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" NOT a crying child. My son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

Is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? What about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? Was that just an excuse to burst in? He sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

Update: Landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. Good news!,"Well, here's my update! And with good news!

So first of all, I just wanted to say: wow. The amount of support I received, both in replies and in PMs, was absolutely amazing. Everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. The person who said ""Sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

That said - I feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). He's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

I know some of you were hoping I'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

Yesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

We ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren't having the conversation with him I'd think he were a caricature). He's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

He still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

The past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I'll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I'll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I'm satisfied. I'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",legaladvice
[MN] A girl is planning to claim I am the father of her baby when we never had sex,"I've been living in a foster home since January '18. I turn 15 in March. The foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. She blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. I never had sex with her, and I would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. Unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. The foster ""parent"" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.

I can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. I said I would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks I will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample.

NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"Long time LA reader here, and I'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story.

It'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

Aaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.

Aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down & helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.

We phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

I think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

I've spoken to several attorneys and law firms throughout the state and have settled on one and signed the papers and all that stuff today. I want to thank all of you for giving me advice on what to ask and look for when speaking to them all, it really helped in narrowing it down and figuring out who was the best to go with. I can't really give out a whole lot of information because we are just starting to gather all the pieces and put it all together. There most likely will not be any updates to this for quite some time.

To answer the endless messages I received about race, I am white and early 20's, the person I was misidentified as is also white but in his 30's.

I spoke to my boss and HR and will be back at work very soon and 2 months pay advance that will be paid back with OT. Also my landlord was really nice and is letting me pay the back rent over the next few months in installments.

"UPDATE - [MI, USA] Considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now I have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear","Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

I promised an update so here it is. First off, I want to thank everyone who strongly suggested I go see a doctor ASAP. I went to see an ENT and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. My hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. The tinnitus was still quite bad, so I wanted to see if the doc could help with that. He put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. I saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (This was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

The ringing has gone down considerably, and I'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. It still bothers me at night and while I'm trying to work sometimes. The biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. This has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point I'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

My uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. I'm not planning on suing him. He knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what I was going through. My aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. I haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. They have offered to call me and apologize but I don't want to talk to them. I just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. I'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but I don't care. Fuck that guy. Thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice.",legaladvice

Kicked our at 16. Parents took all my money.,"I had posted this on other subs and was told to post here. 16f.

Three nights ago my parents and I got in a huge fight. I am not a Christian. They are extreme bible thumpers. I am bisexual, they believe I'm going to be burning in hell. I was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. 

I managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. We just moved to this state so I have no friends. My siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. My related family is all thousands of miles away. Last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. Right now I am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and American bulldog, sleeping in my car. My parents forced me to quit my job last week so I could focus more on school. Last night I checked my bank account. My parents drained the 1k savings I had in it. It is completely empty. 

I'm just scared and don't know where to turn. I primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. I do not want to give them up but I'm not sure how much longer I can without neglecting them. Giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. I will not give up on them easily. Having them around has protected me from many bad situations.

Work Punishments Include Drinking Soap and Other Abuse,"My girlfriend works at a retail store in California.

Other punishments include doing pushups, coworkers being allowed to hit you with a stick, drinking soap, eating dog food, and sucking on undesirable objects that are not meant for human consumption.

UPDATE 2.5: There's been lots of debate about whether the sling is allowed or not. AA told me: 1) Yes, medical devices are allowed. 2) I am protected under ACAA and ADA. 3) Technically on AA you don't need to always make a ""special request"" to allow the device. In most cases, you can just tell the crew that it's a medical device and they should understand. But for extra safety it helps to make a note on your profile about it. 4) There should be no obstructive items in the way during takeoff and landing. However this particular AA representative said that the sling is ""not an obstructive item"".

Amazon link for the curious: https://amzn.to/36xbjY3


UPDATE 2: AA called me, apologized for the FA ""escalating out of control"". They will open an internal investigation. I conveyed that I don't want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 But that it's up to AA to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. I don't want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

She assured me that I won't get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me. 

**I did not ask for compensation and told her that I'm NOT here on a vengeance.** Not here to make money or fame from AA. Nope. Did not make a dime from this and don't plan to. I will not be responding to media inquiries. https://imgflip.com/i/3f8i7p 

For those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - I'm a 120lb girl lol. I injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

Forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. Around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. It's just that I talked back (""no I don't but okay"") and I regret that so much. 

Halloween is over but she spooked me to the core. 

Someone asked if it's a racial thing. I'm not white but it's probably not a related to race.

UPDATE 1: Thank you so much for your quick advice on a Sunday morning! I memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

As we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

""The police will contact you when you get home. You will be banned from future flights."" 

""Ok."" 

""Oh I hope so."" As she walked away. 

I burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. She won. 

There was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my Miranda rights. I made it home in one piece. Still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future AA flights. I've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. My Thanksgiving and Holiday flights are both on AA. 

My seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. They gave me their business card in case I need a witness. 

Thank you again for your helpful comments. I am not in jail (yet) at least!

Original post: 

I can't believe this is happening to me. I'm flying from Chicago to Boston now and police are waiting for me when I land, so I don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

Edit: I've looked all over the internet and can't find any FAA rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

Here's what happened:

..

I was on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston on November 3rd, 2019. Because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, I use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. This sling is often advertised on Facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

Right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. I am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""You have to put your feet on the ground!"" I cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""No I don't but okay."" As I put my feet down. Emphasizing again. **I complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** Although I had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights I've taken with my foot sling, I complied. I put my feet down immediately. 

Even if it's technically not allowed by some rule I'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

She immediately escalated: 
""Would you like to go back to the gate? We're gonna go back to the gate!"" And immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

But right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

She came back to my seat and barked: 
""Police will be waiting for you when we land in Boston.""

My seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. I had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no I don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

Her statement caused me to panic inside. I'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

So I took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight.

"My niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her.","Located in Oklahoma, USA

My sister and I have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. Our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. My niece told my sister about it when she got home. My sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. So they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

The principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. The only thing I can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? They risked my niece's safety and I think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but I'm not sure what could be done.

Update: My sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. The board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. The school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution.

[UPDATE] I'm pregnant and being investigated by DCS.,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5smsoi/indiana_im_pregnant_and_being_investigated_by_dcs/) is my original post. When I made it, I was advised to get a lawyer right away. I was also advised that Indiana's DCS doesn't investigate pregnant women who don't already have kids, and that the woman claiming to be a social worker might be an imposter.

I contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. He seemed to agree that something was very fishy. To make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with DCS. 

I'm still in complete shock.

We went straight to the police. They're taking this very seriously. I can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. I never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. I feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

I haven't had the baby yet. We're staying at a trusted family member's home until the baby is born. My OB and the hospital we'll be delivering at have already been informed of the situation, and will be taking the appropriate security measures. I'm still freaking out, but we're taking every precaution for the safety of my child, and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

Left her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers.

I jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she'd found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (I have no reason to doubt the woman's intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

I drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

I was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a Good Samaritan that I just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her.

When I saw it, I told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and I also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that I told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

The movie ended around 9:10 pm and I had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. I told her I'd be up to tuck her in.

He mother was SCREAMING into the phone ""YOU TELL HIM FUCK YOU! YOU CAN SAY THAT! I SAY ITS OK FOR YOU TO TELL YOUR FATHER FUCK YOU!!""

I took the phone from my daughter and I said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

She yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

I asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. My ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

I handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (Bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was Saturday night so I bent the bedtime a bit). 

I had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

I walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""I'm sorry"" into the phone. I fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

I walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

It wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. She had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

I sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. She was really upset and wouldn't speak much. I hugged her. My daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her.

"UPDATE: Hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. Building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (TO, Canada)","Link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

First I want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and I are quite happy with. I've been very active on Reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. It has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. I digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

Through the advice I received on this subreddit, I contacted the city and the health department right away. I was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. The more we spoke the more interested he became. He called and asked me ""if I were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would I be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" To which I replied ""150%"". He then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, I said ""no."" 

Shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. I went out and asked them why. They told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. I told them they were to leave it there as I have called the city and they are on their way. They didn't seem happy. As if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. Literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. I also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. I have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. This lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

I explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. According to Toronto Health and Bylaws that is bullshit. The situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. The bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information I have been receiving from the building management. 

The bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. I heard nothing until Monday. Come Monday morning I get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that Wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. They will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. The cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. I'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

The city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. I do not believe them at all. We have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. From what I understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. Now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. I have the personal contact information for the officer I spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. We went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

Thank you so much Reddit!!! I couldn't have done it without your help!!

We called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.

We got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).

We continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

We get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""Creepers"" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

When they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

They kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

The school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. What the hell do we do?

Edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.",legaladvice
"[NE & CO] My mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. Can she do that?","For some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. She has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since I've moved out for college. She demands access to absolutely everything I have. This will be important later.

&#x200B;

I'm 18 years old, and I'm a college freshman. I go to college in Colorado, but I was born and raised in Nebraska. In Nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. It was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. Like I said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when I do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200B;

My mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. Email, WhatsApp, Facebook (even though I haven't used it in years), Twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if I don't give it to her. In the past, I've rolled over and taken it. It was a survival mechanism more than anything. If I'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. She justifies this by claiming that because I have autism, I can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200B;

About a month ago, I changed all my passwords. Sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that I need to give her my new passwords. I tell her no. This is where trouble begins.

&#x200B;

Over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. She's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. Although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. A week ago, she showed up here and I had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. That pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200B;

Recently, though, as in last night, I was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" I asked her to clarify and she said that because I'm still a minor in Nebraska, and I'm a resident of Nebraska, I have to abide by Nebraska's laws and as such, I am still a minor and she can do that. I wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like I wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as I've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. It's not nice. I do not want to be gooned and taken home. I don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200B;

So the question is this: can she do that? Is the Fugitive Slave Act not dead after all? Does my having autism change the circumstances any? If all else fails, what can I do to protect myself?",legaladvice
(va) My son stole a rare toy from my brother. My brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. What do I do?,"Right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. Here is the story.

&#x200B;

Last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. While we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. My brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what I know it's one of his biggest hobbies. Well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200B;

Well, until yesterday. My brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and I needed to return it immediately. I honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. Well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a Boba Fett figure from his collection. He confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200B;

I was furious and took it from him. Here is the problem though, after I confirmed with my brother it was his I found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. Apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. So my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. Well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. I told him I would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, what are my options here? I can't afford to pay him back right now. If he does go the police will my son get arrested? He's only 15. It was very wrong of him to do but I think my brother is over reacting. What can I expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",legaladvice

"Bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because I dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?","I have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way I dress. My neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

About a month ago, I moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. I didn't expect any trouble. My first introduction to this woman, let's call her Karen, was my first week here. I went to check the mail and I wasn't wearing a bra. I had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. Karen is one of *those* Southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. You know the type. She waved at me and I waved back, trying to be pleasant. She came at me, I thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

It was creepy and weird. I am not at all well endowed, I go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not Karen. Karen urged me to think of her children and Jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. It was so goddamn weird, I felt like laughing in her face, but I didn't want there to be issues so I said I'd be more diligent in the future and Karen went about her business.

Well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for Karen, y'all, oh no. Not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. Karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. While my breasts are small and humble, I am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

The second time Karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. She threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated I got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a Jezebel and that I needed Jesus. Because I was wearing Jean shorts.

We live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and I like to go out for walks, but it seems every time I step foot out of my door, there's fucking Karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. It's getting annoying. 

This is in Florida, by the way.

EDIT: I got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (I do not regularly dress like this) I must have been quite a sight to Karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. She started laying into me. I just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then I said ""you can stop the games, Karen. I see the way you look at me, I know you want me."" Her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""I'll pray for you."" Then scurried away. Actually went inside her house. 😂",legaladvice

My mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600V. The doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. It put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.,"Location: US. Original incident happened in Indiana.

I should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point I doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

&#x200B;

When I was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. She thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. This led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. It turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

&#x200B;

It could be some form of PTSD I suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. She told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

Is there anything they can do at this point? I feel like she suffered so much and was given absolutely zero compensation for what happened. It makes me furious knowing how much pain she went through and nothing was done about it.",legaladvice
A male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. He just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.,"Spa is in Maryland. A friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. He is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. He has not spoken with management yet. He just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. Any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

Edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

Minor update: I advised him of his many options after reading the comments. He went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. Mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

I'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. The mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room.

"New York- Mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while I was babysitting 4 year old step sister","Hi folks

I'm a 21 year old college student. My parents separated soon after I was born, and my my mom raised me alone until I was 15. She met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister Eliza. She's grown up with me, and I often baby sit for her for short periods of time. I live with a roomate in apartments owned by the College

Late last week, my stepfather's mom died. He's Polish, so my mom and he left for Poland leaving me to babysit Eliza for a week. Yesterday, I got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in Poland. I've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

I have no idea what to do. My biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. My mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the USA that I am aware of. I'm studying Political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but I have no job and no salary. 

Eliza has no family other than me that I can turn to. I'm not ready to take of a child, but I also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and I've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. But we also look very different- my dad is Jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. So I'm a tall, mixed race dude while Eliza is a small blonde girl (I bring this up because I was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

So what do I do? I'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and I haven't even told Eliza yet. It just hit me that we're now alone, and I now have to step up to the plate and take care of Eliza. I have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

We talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  This has not helped.  We escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  Not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

The principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""

The principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

I went to school and asked what's going on. I did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

First, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. Second, the principal explained the situation to me. It had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. Thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

When I asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. I asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

I told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. I told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat I'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

Up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

I talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. He only knew that she had left the school. He showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

In short: they backed off after I made sure they understood that I won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

Small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. Someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. I will try talking to them to make sure. They deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at. ",legaladvice

**Old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that I was having a ton of issues. I found out my therapist is her husband, but I didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200B;

**New developments summary**: There's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. I even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200B;

**New developments, continued**: Therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). I have a very peculiar family dynamic, so I think he talked about that. However, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. Unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that I was depressed and had family issues. Neat. One of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. Understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200B;

**Resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than I thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. Therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. I don't know if he'll practice again.

I suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. I managed to procure specimen in question. What do I do now?,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit. Sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and I don't know what to do. Let me break down some background first:

&#x200B;

My dad is currently dying of liver failure. He's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  We have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. The man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. He's taking light doses of morphine and Lorazepam so that he can sleep. The consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to Thanksgiving....

&#x200B;

My step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  There was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (My dad would be the 5th man)

She's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. NOT through any Vet or other official. She is barred from EVERY animal shelter and adoption agency in the STATE as a result.

So with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200B;

She brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. He was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. In a matter of LESS THAN A MINUTE after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction I've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. Before I even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""Do you see the light yet??? Do you see all the pretty angels??"" (WTF????). He's been in an essentially catatonic state since. Out cold for the past 12 hours. It was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. In tears, I begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. I was truly scared and genuinely thought I was going to lose him right then and there. We called Hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. They are on staff 24/7). She wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

But he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and NOTHING like this has ever happened. I'm just a lay person, but that did NOT seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened IMMEDIATELY following the food, like flipping a light switch.

Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe i'm reading too much into it.  But I managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. My first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? Is that even a thing? Do I take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? A hospital?

With him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

&#x200B;

Again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, I probably wouldn't think anything of it....

Any and all feedback would be much appreciated. I'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",legaladvice
Minnesota: Landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. What now?,"For some background I am renting an apartment and my lease ends on September 30th. My landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. I do have a lease that says I get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which I believe is the law itself, but in this case I did not get that notice.

Last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8AM saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). He asked if I could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing I'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

I did not see these messages until I took lunch at 12. I texted my landlord back saying I thought I am supposed to get notice for entry and I'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though I'm sure that doesn't legally count).

Long story short they robbed me and I have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. They took everything of value such as laptop and TV and even some stupid things like my lamps.

My renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). Now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and I should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

Meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. He met them at Dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. I told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place I would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

What now? Push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? I would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",legaladvice
[WI] My girlfriend's landlord just entered her house when he thought nobody was home.,"My girlfriends landlord entered her house after he talked to her as she was going to work. He believed nobody to. Be home, but I was here laying in bed. I woke up to him coming into the apartment to use the bathroom and then leaving. When I said something as he was leaving he ignored me. I text my girlfriend about it to see if she had given him permission to enter and she said no. He did have permission to enter the building at 11 am to show her apartment, but this was at 9:30 am and he had no tenant to sho the apartment to. He just came in, used the bathroom and left. He didn't even finish flushing the toilet. 

When I confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. He then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. And when I explained to him that I had every right to be there because I had permission from the tenant to be there, he said ""okay, I'll let you go this time."" 

My girlfriend feels uncomfortable here because he just entered the unit without her permission. How can we make sure he doesn't do this again? 

Also, the dude didn't even finish flushing the toilet and left a turd in it.

Edit 1: the landlord is the property owner.

Edit 2: there was an empty unit across the hall.",legaladvice
Update: I am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. My step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses.

I just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). I was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

He was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. One of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). Unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

He gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

I also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* They both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. They aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* Apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. With her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. So now she is paying her way. 

Anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

Thank you so much for your help.",legaladvice
"[UPDATE] [GA] Just moved into a condo, neighbor is raising hell over my nonexistent pet bird"," [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8chp37/ga_just_moved_into_a_condo_neighbor_is_tasing/)

Tl;dr of previous post\- My next door neighbor is absolutely convinced I have a pet bird and has made complaints to the HOA, animal control, and the police because my supposed pet bird is so loud it is causing emotional distress.

I got another complaint from the head guy running the HOA that my \(now multiple\) birds are causing severe emotional distress to my neighbors and their children, who can't sleep at night because of my ""flock"" of birds. The wife sent a recording to him as proof of my bird\(s\), and to tell him to tell me my smoke alarm is also beeping and needs the batteries replaced because they can hear it from their unit as well. 

Now, you can clearly hear a smoke alarm beeping, as well as birds chirping on the recording. However, the beeping is coming from their unit, as I can faintly hear it if I press my ear to the shared wall. And the birds that are supposedly my pets? The ones that are so loud that their whole household can't sleep and it's causing severe emotional distress? THOSE ARE THE BIRDS OUTSIDE. IT'S LITERALLY THE CHIRPING OF THE BIRDS OUTSIDE THEY'RE HEARING. Now, I'm no Disney princess, so I have no effect on wild birds\- or imaginary pet birds\- for that matter. I mean, my singing is so terrible it actually scares them away.  And I'm not sure how any person that is not a complete moron would mistake ordinary bird chirping for ""a flock of loud, abused rain forest birds"".

I've sent a letter to the HOA telling them to kindly pound sand and stop harassing me over the wild birds that I have no control over. I'm also going to record the birds from my porch and from inside the condo so if they say I have birds again I can prove that it's just ordinary outside birds making reasonable outside bird noises.  I'm looking into get a bird feeder as well, because it's allowed by the HOA covenants and fuck these people for being utter imbeciles and blaming me for the natural behaviour of wild animals. 

Now I'm just going to sit and wait for the next problem they have with me,  because I don't think these nitwits will take kindly to being proven wrong over something so stupid.",legaladvice
"[UPDATE] This man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, I have a specific question regarding something I want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.","I would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). Sorry for not updating you right away as I was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

So here's what happened. I liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. So I hired a guy which I'll call him Frank.

After waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

A few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom I recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. We went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. Shockingly he was completely understanding. He told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both Frank and I a settlement if I agree not to sue. I called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed Frank for his drone plus way more money that I would've ever paid him. He also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that I wont pursue any legal action.

It was a happy ending and I was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but I must admit that I feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. Never have I felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. While we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! So the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and I'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",legaladvice
"TSA detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the ER and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.","I'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

My father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a [port](https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/CDR756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  We came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (New York) facing the customer directly at our shop. They sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. I'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. However, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

Today, they were flying from TN (I don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to Houston, TX, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   He had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (Brooklyn, NY) and in Texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which I will request from his doctors tomorrow)  He also brings a printout from the TSA about traveling with a port and cancer which I will find the exact link to when I get more info.  

My parents arrive 3:45 to a Tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
Both parents have TSA pre and get on line at about 4. They are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  The agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the ID, etc.  My father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. Meanwhile I assume he is not speaking his best English, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. I'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which I think adds to the confusion. They wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. They don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

Both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  They go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   My father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  He calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  He tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (His first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) They take him into a small room away from my mother. He is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  The agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. The agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  My father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  I have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. He couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

He tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) The agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   The agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. My father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  They bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  They wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  They agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  They take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. He asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. By this point the plane has left.  They go to the ER to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

He has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  My father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  Port is OK but they want to check him out again before flying.

I would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. If he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  Can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? They have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. I am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so I have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that I can go over with her later, so I'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
My family is very quiet, I don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  I would if that is the only option, however.  I don't know if it's relevant that we are Muslim, either, I assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  My father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  He doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  I would love some advice.  Apologies for length.

I think my dads company is responsible for his death [California],"My dad passed away last week while at work. He had a massive heart attack. He was in the bathroom while the attack happened and he tried calling 911 repeatedly. Here's the thing though, 6 months ago, his company installed some kind of signal blocking device in the bathrooms because employees were going to the toilet and browsing the internet. 

The doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. Last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so I'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived. 

I spoke to the company and they've told me to get lost, saying it's private property and they're well within their rights to use jammers how they please. Is that true? I'm struggling with the funeral costs as it is, I can't afford a lawyer, especially if it's going to go nowhere. ",legaladvice
Today I came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from,"[The Mystery Fence](https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nQdq)

Delaware, USA. No homeowners association.

We live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. It's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. There was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). I removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

Well I come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. Part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. The leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

I don't know who owns it, so I called the real estate agent. He was just as shocked as I was when I told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. He had no idea. He'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. I asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. She didn't.

I had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. Those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. This lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) I came home to my wood missing and I found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. Someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. I contacted the guy, and got it back. I then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the NY State Government Property Lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. I told her to never do that again and mind her own business. Her response was ""I am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake.

(Update) School kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. Lawyers are expensive...,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

The past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. Now I can't go into a lot of the details after but I can go over some of the details that happened during.

We contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. We first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

Our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. Then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. So he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. Talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which I thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

He spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. During this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. Something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

So our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. The lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

Finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

Now I can't go into a lot of the details but I can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. Lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. I just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. We are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

Thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school.",legaladvice
"Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

I own an apartment in downtown Toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with AirBnB tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. Currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until January.

I decided to list my place up for a rental in late August, for rental until Janaury. Since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). I immediately got a hit by a person named Jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.She signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""No short term rentals, through services such as AirBnB"".

Yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* On Monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. Along with a strong smell of pot. They apparently identified themselves as AirBnB renters. (Apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through AirBnB).
* I am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* I am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* Apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

After getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on AirBnB, using very recent photos of my apartment. I tried to contact Jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

I have tried numerous times to talk to AirBnB, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

Aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. Unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. Do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*EDIT\* I forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. Since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. I want to stop randoms from AirBnB from entering my apartment now. ",legaladvice
"UPDATE: I just recieved a demand letter from Enterprise Rent-a-Car stating that if I do not return their rental car, I will be charged with Embezzlement and Grand Theft Auto. I never rented a car from them. (San Jose, California)","Thank you to everyone for the advice. I'm also a SHE by the way (many of you thought I was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

After my initial post, I saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because Enterprise is the one at fault and I shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. So I did exactly this, and she told me that id I want her to give me more info, I would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that I am NOT the person who rented the car.  If not, she would report me for Embezzlement and Grand Theft to the Sacramento Police. Upon hearing this, I decided to file a report immediately online with the San Jose Police Department. I know many of you said I shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, I did not want to take any chances where I could end up with a warrant on my head.  I thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  After filing it, I emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  When I spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that I was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

On May 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. She showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had MY information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with CASH. (I thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) The manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the Sacramento Police later that afternoon. The following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as FRAUD, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  At this point, I was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. I then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to Sacramento see who the hell this woman is. However, turns out I didn't have to because 2 HOURS LATER...  
  
  
  
THE SAN JOSE POLICE DID SHOW UP KNOCKING ON MY FRONT DOOR. ( 2 Policemen and 2 CHP officers) Before opening it, the first thing I did was grab the copy of the police report I printed because I seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). When I open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if NAME OF WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW lives at my home? I tell them no, and that I have no idea who that is,  then they ask if I am ALYMG and I tell them that I am. They then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of Fremont that morning. The accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. They then show the license to me and it's an EXACT replica of MY DRIVERS LICENSE, and I ask them how this is possible if I have my license in my wallet? They then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (The black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) I then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from Enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when I hand them my report. I explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from Enterprise.  So basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. I told the officers that I have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. I then asked them who is the NAME OF THE WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW and they told me that she is the who stole the car. However, I'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we DO NOT look a-like at all. Idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. But after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

I do have her name now though, and After doing a google search I found her Facebook and other social media accounts. I'm very tempted to message her but I've decided to leave this to the police because I have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she DOES know where I live) However, I do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

Girlfriend was arrested w/ a DUI but blew a .06!!! Cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!,"So..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. She didn't drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. When the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). On her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. A minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. She admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

This is when it gets interesting. 

The officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. He then declared that she was drunk WITHOUT HAVING HER BLOW TO TEST HER BAC, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

THEN, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! That's below the legal limit (we are in Wyoming). And the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her BAC was. 

My question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? We have no money and probably can't afford a good lawyer. I could barely afford her bail. She is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn't deter her from pursuing her dream. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. We have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

Edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn't tell her the Miranda rights (found out he doesn't need to)


Edit: thank you all so much for the help

Edit: I am against drunk and unsafe driving (and so is my gf). In this situation she believed that she was good to drive and would not harm anyone. It was a shitty situation all around and she wishes that she had just walked or taken an Uber.

My parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. I am sick of this shit (Florida),"For clarity we're both minors. I'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. She has never been right since we were little kids. Always violent. She bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when I was 5 because I wouldn't let her ride my bike. All of my life I've been putting up with this shit and I have had enough.

She hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. My parents wont do anything about it. She's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. I really don't know what is wrong with her. She's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. My parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. They refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". Which brings us to today. My parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. Whatever, not important.

Anyway, I was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. We decided to go to the Dollar Tree to get some snacks. Demon didn't buy anything. As we left the store I could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. I confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! I don't know why. Don't they make meth out of those or something? So I told her I was going to call mom. I pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! I was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was I going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. I took her down and had her pinned on the ground. That's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will NOT stop otherwise. I had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. She got me in the throat and I was letting her go! I was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. Blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

It took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. It hurts like a bitch. My friend gave me a bunch of Tylenol and it still hurts. I came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *I* do to upset her?! I was so angry I told them I was calling the cops and my dad told me I couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! Is that true??? 

Something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and I'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  Please help me. 

Update: Well shit went down basically how I expected it would. My mom called me very upset that police had came. What happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. I asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her Baker Acted because I was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. Well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and I guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. My mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. She said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved. ",legaladvice
the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action [TX],"When I was 14, I was raped by a close family friend. I got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when I was 15. I knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but I did not know their names or what they were like. We received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. I do not remember signing anything.  I do not know what happened to the friend; I asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. My mother said he was jailed but I don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. I  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. My husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&#x200B;

A month ago, I received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. I believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. She told me that she wanted to get to know me. I spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. I found myself disgusted by her. There are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. She is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. I decided that I would not be comfortable meeting her. I blocked her without responding. After a week, I began to receive letters from her. Four letters in total. I did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. I finally answered. I told her that I was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or I would get the police involved.

&#x200B;

She  began to berate me. She told me  that my family was her family. She accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that I had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that I had held back important information. Without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  She told me that she would be making contact with my family whether I liked it or not. She also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if I did not comply and that I could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. When I began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. If I agreed to pay for a round of IVF, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. Here are my questions:

&#x200B;

1. Does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if I tell her to stay away?
2. Could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. My parents are dead and I do not know how to find out information about the adoption. I did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. I am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. Could I be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. I have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. Could I form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if I agreed to pay?

Edit: amount asked for was removed. Also, because several people have asked: I do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. It only stopped once I left the state. I am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and I will need to move again.  ",legaladvice

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r12hs/pa_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and_threatens_to


My post was not hugely popular, but I have a small update. Thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, I read all of them, even the ones I didn't reply to immediately.

I called the police last night. An officer came out to my house, he read the messages, saw the photos, and said, ""Yeah that's illegal and I don't think it gets much easier to prosecute than this."" He had my fiance send him screenshots of everything and then the photos separately. He took my ex's information, our information, and the surprisingly ample amount of information I have on his girlfriend. 

My ex is currently on both probation and parole, so the officer is reaching out to his PO today for a current address since he refused to provide it to me. He'll be calling my ex today, and if he hangs up on him or gets smart, he'll be prepared with an address to just go talk to him. He also knows where he is working this evening while the officer is on duty, so that is a last resort.

He is also going to run the evidence and our statements by the DA's office today and get the green light to proceed with charges, which apparently will include an actual arrest once everything that needs to happen happens. I'm not clear on the details exactly, I just know that they are almost certainly going to be charging him with a misdemeanor 2. 

Additionally, I am almost positive that my ex's current girlfriend, who he has been with for roughly 9 months now, was involved in some manner. She is an RN, so if it comes to light that she was complicit, she could also be charged and lose her job. I don't know how it would impact her license as an RN, but I did work for the hospital she works for currently, and any charges, no matter how minor, result in termination. The officer confirmed this, as well. 

And I took everyone's advice - I contacted my attorney. He is drafting a cease and desist letter to send to both my ex and his current partner. He is also going to request a copy of the police report to add to the already massive stack of evidence of reasons why he should not get custody of either of his kids, he should remain strictly on visitation, if he's lucky enough to even get that.

Thank you everyone, I have a small amount of hope that this will work out favorably. My current partner doesn't care what he has to say or what pictures he sends, he sees it every day. He also knows that my ex is vindictive and is grasping at straws in an adult temper tantrum. Hopefully this will end the years of this crap from my ex, as this is not the first partner he has done this with. It's just finally a charge in PA!",legaladvice
My brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. What actions should I take against him?,"Hello. I'm a first-time poster, and I'm also on mobile. I am 19, and I currently live in New York City.

My parents died when my brothers and I were young (Eldest was 11, Second (the brother in question) was 7, and I was 5). They left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. I turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. It was in March 2019 that I finally got it. It turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. I decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. I wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

Yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. I called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after I deposited the money. My savings account has also been taken from. I'll admit, I really should have been paying more attention, but I was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and I got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. We tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. He had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

When I confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. He spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. I know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. It's just line after line of Uber Eats, Postmates, and game purchases. My grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. It would take YEARS for him to make that money back on minimum wage. Should I call the police and have him arrested? Is there any way to get that money back?


Edit: Okay, I've decided to call the police and sue the bank. I know how to get my hands on bank statements, and I'll record him confessing to the theft. But I don't know how to hire a lawyer. Where do I start?

Edit #2: Okay I just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. My grandma sends him to the store with her ATM card sometimes to get money. He memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

Edit #3: Thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. I got a ton of messages and I'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

I've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. We're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. Haven't gotten him arrested yet, but I told her if need be, I would call them myself.

I like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. My mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. She explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. She had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an ATM.

Edit #4: So I went to the bank. Because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. No case to sue the bank with. There's nothing I can do to get the money back. I'm ruined financially. All I can do is sue him and put him in jail, but I'm never gonna see that money again. I'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and I'm sorry if I haven't responded to your messages yet. Also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. This will be the last edit I make, hopefully.",legaladvice

"[UPDATE] [Texas] My Mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. However, the police is still alive, and when I showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. How can I get my cat back?","Link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

Hello,

First off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. I didn't feel like advice to steal my cat back was 'legal' (thus, being in this subreddit), so I took one users advice to talk to the director of Animal Control in my mom's city.

She basically told me that the police have no idea what they're doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. She said that the only thing I can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as 'stolen property'. She said the police will understand what to do if a I reference my cat as 'property' and not an animal.

I went to the police station and the police threw me around again. Despite I tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn't 'property'. After 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom's texts. 

The cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, I can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my 'stolen property'.

We get to my mom's house and she's not there. We look around the outside of her house and find no signs of Kitty either. I call her and ask her where she is, and told her that I was at her house with the police. She said, in quote, ""I took the cat and ran off into Oklahoma and I'm not ever coming back."" 

The police said they can't help me since they don't have jurisdiction in Oklahoma. 

I went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so I left because I can't afford it. On my way home, I contacted Adult Protective Services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. So I hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

I also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into Oklahoma. My mom played the 'poor me' card, so my family bought into it. And somehow, I'm now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... When I got home, I cut everyone out. All of my family. I separated every single tie I had to them.

I've had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if I'm being open about the situation, I was a victim of childhood abuse. That cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me I won't be able to get him back. I ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now I'm getting help for my own mental health. This situation broke me, and right now, I'm trying to recover.

Thank you everyone for listening. 

**Tl;dr:** My cat is gone and I'll never get him back.",legaladvice

Original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

Turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  It was my roommate SAYING my landlord had said I couldn't hospice there.

Yeah.  I know.

I specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding I would be dying in this house.  I'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  And I guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  So instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""You can't do in-home hospice here"".  


Obviously this is super illegal (thanks, LA!), and I call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking Saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  Lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

I started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after I threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and I call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what I was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

So yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because I subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  My attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  Everybody wins?  

Except I still gotta die, yo.  After I move lol.  At least I can afford it I guess.  :(

I'd like to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who responded to my last post. Your advice helped prepare me for what came next.

&#x200B;

Pretty soon after I posted, I received a letter in the mail from a lawyer that basically said that my parents were demanding a paternity test on the basis of grandparents rights. I knew from my post that it was unlikely that a lawyer would take this case, so I googled the law firm and lawyer's name. I couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so I reached out to them. The letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. They asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. I don't know exactly what's happening as I have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

&#x200B;

In other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that I also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. We still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

[UPDATE] Coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex's dog euthanized. Can I help prevent this?,"[Link to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Glad to say I've got a happy update!

The coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). I wasn't working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

The ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. He's also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. The dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn't shown any human or dog aggression. 

Police and animal control are very good around here. They assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they'd require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. Additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can't be ""bitten"" by the dog without violating it. And the department says they don't allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog's owner but not the police/animal control. 

So the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. I'd call it a win!

My School is demanding for a copy of every students car key. (GA),"I found this out about two hours ago. My  High school posted the rule book along with the normal info for the  school year.

In the rule book section about driving to school, it states in bold letter; ALL STUDENTS WHO DRIVE TO SCHOOL USING A PERSONAL VEHICLE MUST GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THE KEY OR KEY FOB.

After I read this I thought it was a misprint or a mistake. So I called the principal and school board, they both said that it was real and if you park on school property you must follow that rule.

About 30 minutes later I checked the school website and others were complaining  on the forums about it. They went on to post their reason, they want to be able to do random searches or drug sweeps.

I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately.,"I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

This is a throwaway account, due to certain circumstances I worry for my safety of myself, family, & friends so thus the throwaway. 

I am currently residing in Wisconsin.

I believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

**Information:**
My very first inkling something was up, is the day I believe this happened he came running crying into my arms when I picked him up, previously he was excited to be dropped off and picked up because he loved being there. And they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

After this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

That night I had picked him up, I changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. This is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or ""washes his hands"" with the baby wipes. This time he was not himself. He was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. As I took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, ""No! No no [Friends boyfriends name]!"" And began crying hysterically. 

My heart sank. As a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. I know something was done to my baby. 

I looked my friends boyfriend's criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. This man is dangerous, and I didn't even know this.

**My Concerns And What Can I do?:**

Notably in Wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does CPS investigate the person reporting? Both myself and the party involve?

Will the investigators / CPS take this matter seriously when regarding my child's age?

How do I go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

What kind of things will they (either CPS or law enforcement etc) look into?

If reported, and nothing happens, what things can I do to protect my child(ren) And my family? 

For a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs I can keep my eyes open for?

Any advice, any help at all will greatly help. I'm absolutely devastated and need help as I'm at a loss.

**Edit:** I need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why I'm scared for myself and my family.

I have a six month old Australian Shepherd. We live on the fifth floor and the GS lives about four doors down. We run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

He has attacked my AS in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. He attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the GS was hostile. The worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. When we walked inside the GS was off his lease and immediately started attacking my AS. The owner did not immediately intervene. I got down to try to get between the GS and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. After about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the GS off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. I took pictures after the event. I had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my AS's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

I first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. They said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. I spoke with the owner of the GS after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their GS just for on the grounds. The attacks have happened so often that I do not think they can easily control their dog. My AS is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from GS's if he sees them in public.

After seeing the GS and the owner for about a week after these events, I kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. I spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. She said that the 8 month old GS is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. I suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. She said she is not comfortable with that.

I do not know the logistic of ESD's but I do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. What should I do in this situation? I feel that if I go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume ESD's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** this post got a lot of responses and I'm so thankful for it. I read all your comments. Unfortunately the post was locked before I even got off work so I didn't get to reply to all.

Stemming from the advice I got I contacted the apartment again via email so that I'd have a paper trail, I explained that she said she would not muzzle him due to him ""being a ESD"". I also provided links to local government sites stating that ESD's are not the same as service dogs, and directly asked that they intervene at this point. I am awaiting their response.

I also called the local Department of neighborhood services. I filed my case, she said they will assign someone to it who will contact me and begin the investigation into it.

In lieu of this, I then contacted the pet store where the worst attack occurred. The owner was very supportive on the idea of starting a case against them. She remembered the incident and said that I had made a purchase afterwards, so she looked up my name and found the exact time we were in the store. She said she will trim the cctv footage into a clip and email it to me.

So now I will have footage of the attack in the store, a picture of the resulting marks on my arm as well as my dogs bloody paw, and the email exchange with the apartment. I feel pretty ready to get this started now.

Thank you to everyone who came here to help. I really had no idea where to go with this. I'd just like to say that my goal is not to have their dog euthanized. I blame the owners completely for this. I'm sure with the proper training he would not be so uncontrollable. My goal is for the GS to be muzzled while he is in public, and hopefully to be removed and given to responsible owners if possible. Thanks for everyone's care and advice!

"Neighbor's ""kid"" won't move his car from taking up the TWO spaces in front of our home. After asking politely to move it, family retaliated by moving ALL their cars to the road taking up all the space adjacent to our home.","California here, getting that out of the way. And full disclosure, its not my home. The home belongs to my parents, but I house sit for weeks or months at a time for them and deal with the neighbors enough to care(plus I love my parents and want what's best for them). I will just be saying MY home or MY driveway so I dont have to keep typing ""my parent's driveway"" or ""my parent's home"" over and over.


These neighbors moved in a year or two ago and have made life so uncomfortable for my parents they are actually talking about selling their home to move, their marriage home with ALL the memories. I thought they were selling because they wanted to move out of state, but have since found out it is because of them.

My parent's neighbor's kid (a very immature 20 year old) has a beater he leaves parked in front of my parent's front yard. He has it parked in the middle so that it takes up ALL the space and no one can park on either side of it without blocking a driveway. It has been in 3 wrecks in the past year and currently he wont drive it. Why? I don't know. Perhaps it isn't in running condition any more. All I know is it hasn't been driven in over a month.... well, until what happens next.

I want to also mention they have a full garage. They also have the same size space in front of their yard to park in, which happens to always be empty unless they have company. And a driveway that can fit and does fit 3 of their cars, including another beater that has never left the driveway since they moved in.

I politely asked him to move his car when I saw him several weeks ago and he flipped out on my, cursing and screaming at me. He followed me to my car and was yelling at my car door window to the point it had fog from his breath. Several days later I visited my parents and he had his friends parking in front of his car so as to block my our driveway partially while still leaving the spaces empty behind his car that would block his own driveway and all the spaces in front of his yard were empty to.

I spoke with my parents and they said the kid had his friends doing that ever since I had asked him to move his car as payback. They said he's really mean and to just let it go. This did not sit right to me, so I later after visiting went to the neighbor's home to speak to the parents. I explained the situation and asked they speak with the boy about moving the car and his behavior towards me with the disrespect and language. 

Bad idea. I assumed they were decent normal people and this was just an out of control teen. I assumed mom would just tell 'Billy, go move your damn car' or something and it would be taken care of. Turns out he got it from mom and dad. I get the dad yelling at me to fuck off and get off his property as the mom (from another room) starts bellowing about how I did NOT just tell her how to parent and he can do whatever he wants and fuck me and my parents. 

I didn't know this at that time, but have since found out my parents believe the neighbors keyed their car about 6 months ago. My mom asked the neighbor mom and son to not smoke at the edge of their driveway, as its right next to my parent's bedroom window and they would be awakened by them talking while smoking in the middle of the night. Apparently that set them off and they would talk extra loud while smoking and would hold up a phone playing music to their window as an FU to my mom and dad. That's also when their car got keyed

So since I made the mistake of talking to neighbor parents, it has upgraded from just the kid's one car and his friends when they come over. Now the parents are retaliating too.They finally moved the beater, but only to move their cars from the driveway to taking up the two spaces in front of our yard adjacent to their driveway. The one car parked just enough to have the front poking into our driveway. The beater was moved so its parked on the OTHER side of our driveway in front of our other neighbor's yard but also sticking out enough to just be in the way of our driveway too. Sorry for the run-on sentence. Did that all make sense? I hope so.

This has been going on for a few weeks now.

Is there anything that can be done? My parent's just seem to want to let it go. Not only do they say the street parking is technically public parking and they can't officially complain about it, but they complain the neighbors will only retaliate worse. My parents travel a lot and my work makes it so I cant always be there to sit the house for them. They fear the neighbors will do something to their property when they are gone. I used to think they were over reactionary and the neighbor's kid was just rude, but this isn't right. Is there something that can be done to get them to move their vehicles and/or protect my parents so they dont feel forced to move?


TLDR - neighbors parked all their cars in front of my parents home and wont move them, only rearrange them. The neighbors go out of their way to be jerks to my parents. Parents fear retaliation.",legaladvice
"(NYC) I am being harassed by the orthodox Jewish ""police"" in my home. This has been going on for almost 2 years since I moved in.

I will be following some of the advice recieved and update once I have one. If this works I'll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what I've been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance I'll have no choice but to move. Thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. That has been expecially helpful because it's put my situation into perspective. Yeah it sucks but worst case I can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn't the case for people within the community. And even though the NYPD has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. Hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i've Found myself in for what it is. Will update when I can.**


*Edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home SEVEN times. and this is common.*

I live in Brooklyn NY. I purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by Orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by Orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. I honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

Since i moved in though, this has been a HUGE issue. I don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. I honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. The issue is that they have been using the Jewish police to harass me. 
To give you an idea of the shit I am dealing with I'll tell you what prompted this post.  I chose to have a Superbowl viewing party today. About 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were FIVE people here) I get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. We were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). My condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   Since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people I INVITED from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. I don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that I have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

I am fucking done. I want this to stop. I have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. I have tried calling the NYPD every time they show up. This has not worked. I have complained to my condo association. No help. I have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city AND state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and NOTHING has worked. I keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home THAT I OWN WITH MY PERMISSION. 

Im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. I am just so fed up with this bullshit. I am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a HOME I OWN on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

I (27F) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work,"Hello,

As the post says I am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **Virginia**. I work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. When I was hired I wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. I think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that I'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. I have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. So then I had to buy a wireless mouse. I have a nice computer and I hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

Today I have strep. Strep as an adult is terrible. I told my boss I could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. That night on the phone she said yes please work from home. First thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. It is a google chrome timer extension. I told them that I would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but I was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. She said OK, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since I wouldn't install the timer and that I was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

Thanks for the help!

She ended up taking me to court. Her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before I even met her, and she married me knowing it). Her lawyer claimed otherwise, that I had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. This was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as I had email communications with her acknowledging my record. She insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. Perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. Her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

She dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

Her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. He was a decent guy. Ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. It's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

My family is abusive and I want to emancipate myself,"I'm a 16 year old girl. I live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. My maternal grandfather also stays with us. My parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - I was in the car but I survived - and I was taken in by my maternal aunt. My dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

The last two years have been hell for me. Not only because I still can't get over losing my parents (I cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. My mom was actually estranged from her family. She was white, and my dad was black. Her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. They have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and I guess I'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

They have told me just that on several occasions. That my existence is a mistake. I get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. And I'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. Sometimes it gets physical. Sometimes it feels like I'm trapped in a minefield. I have to be so careful about where I step cause the repercussions may be explosive. My ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. He has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

I can't live like this anymore. I'm an absolute emotional mess. I wanna emancipate myself but I don't know how to go about it. I know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 I'm close with a set of twins at school - I'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. Their parents own a farm and I work regularly with the family. I'm also into photography and I've been doing real good with shooting weddings. They are very lucrative and I've saved up a substantial amount. With summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but I also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

The parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. I've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. I don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

I would really appreciate advice.

Thank you

Neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp,"My boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. I've done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. My front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn't very visible from the street. I painted it to match the house as well.

Few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife's never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which I chalked up to her being shy or whatever. However, recently I got a note taped up to my door that said she's going to sue if I don't take the ramp down, as it's an eyesore and ""reduces curbside value."" I have no idea what she means since you can't see the thing unless you know what to look for and really get up in my property, as confirmed by neighbors and friends.

Bank gave away my entire banking account,"So last week, a check I wrote bounced from an account I have that I rarely use. It's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. I called the bank where I was informed that I closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". I told them I sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. After them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. I finally got them to open a fraud case. 

Here's the crazy part. I call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. I finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. This woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. She lives in Florida and I live in colorado. We do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. So she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. I figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned Facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. Open and shut case.

So now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. They asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but I have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. The icing on the cake was I got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

Do I have any legal recourse? Do I just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? What advice do you have?",legaladvice

My ex proposed. I said no. He is now talking about suing me. Advice?,"Just want to say this is going to sound insane but I am not trolling/making it up.

Me and this guy were together for 3 years. We're 19 now. We never talked about the future until a year in. Before then I'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

In short, I wanted kids, he didn't. I wanted to stay in Ireland, he didn't. I wanted to get married, he didn't. When I realised it was a bad match I broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. This happened a few times over the next 18 months In this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

We knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something I would want further down the line, I wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. If I were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then I might have an issue, but when I'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

When I went to see him this time I was again, considering breaking up with him. Aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that I really don't like. So when I arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, I assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so I wouldn't cause a scene. I don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

In the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. First he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff I liked and what my taste was. I assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so I told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. I also said ""go cheap"".

The other thing he asked me was how I felt about public proposals. I told him immediately that I, personally, disliked them as I felt I wouldn't be able to say no, even if I wanted to. I feel like public proposals are OK when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not OK at all. I assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

I never thought in a million years that he would propose.

So you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

The ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. He got on one knee, and held it out to me. We were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. Everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

I said no.

Well, I didn't so much say ""no"". I ran out of the restaurant.

He drove me there, so I got a cab back, and drove home that night.

I realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but I didn't know what else to do. I could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all I knew was that I didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. I felt like I couldn't even speak, I was so upset about the whole thing. So I just got up and ran.

I just want to take the opportunity to say here that I really really don't care about the rings. Honestly, when I want to get married (which is absolutely not when I'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and I'd say yes. I wouldn't even need a ring. I know I'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what I'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

I didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. He said that he thought a proposal was something I'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. He said that he was out of pocket for the rings. He'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. He linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for €1450 (about $1650/£1300). When I asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped I would cover the cost of mine. He said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. He'd hoped that I would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but I said no. He also said I'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if I was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

We both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. Enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on Sunday.

He has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (€1450) and he also says that I have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which I had no part in spreading. He says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. So €1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

I think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but I am not a law student or a lawyer. He is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

What do I do about all of this? Do I need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

Thanks in advance :)

EDIT:  He knew I wanted to get married but not to him. He not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. He openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and I told him that this was why I was breaking up with him the times before this that I have ended the relationship. During the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like I'm gonna propose"" (that one was last April)

A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).,"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





Edit: You guys were right. The son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. The letter had a bunch of legal terms, so I didn't get the gist when I first read it. I'll be contacting a lawyer ASAP.",legaladvice

I'm in grad school, but still go to the same OBGYN in my home town, out of familiarity and convenience. I was planning to switch once I finished school and settled down. I have him listed as my emergency contact. 

For some reason, they keep calling him to confirm my appointments, despite me telling them three times to never call that number and to please call my cell phone instead. Things came to a head yesterday when they called to confirm my appointment for an ultrasound and he cancelled it without my knowledge.  

(My father and I have a tenuous relationship, but that's not related to this situation. I will also be switching docs ASAP)

This has to be a HIPAA violation, right? I can't imagine they're not doing the same thing to other women. This could get someone seriously hurt, if they were seeking birth control or anything behind the back of an abusive parent/spouse.

"Boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, I was not raped.","I am in Boston BUT my abortion happened in New York City. I was 18 and this was completely legal. 

I'm 18 and in college. Like all 18 year olds, I mess up. I messed up big time and I ended up pregnant. I waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, I went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and I took a couples' trip to NYC so I could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

We got back to Boston and life went on. I am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. I have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, I'm not considered depressed, I have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. I receive my therapy in a non religious environment. This is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before I went to college, my parents are toxic, and I needed help with that burden. 

I told my therapist immediately that I'd had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, I go to a university that I worked my ass off to get into and I'll be damned if I let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. I also could not raise a child that I disdained. Selfish? Yes. But I'm not sorry). I also informed her that my boyfriend and I are still together and that he and I plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. He and I split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

I go home and do homework. At around 4 pm, I get a visit from the Boston Police who are investigating a rape. They think that I'm the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that I've been forced to have an abortion, I ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and I agreed that abortion was the way to go. After a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

Then I get a call from my parents. They're ranting on and on about how I've gotten an abortion and sinned in God's eyes, how I've been fornicating and screwed every man in NYC, and how my lack of contact (I'm NC with them because of abuse and they're narcissists) is killing my mother. They screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they've been given my address in Boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

It becomes clear. My therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (I never gave her their number, address, or personal information. She did not know their names, I only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that I'd been raped and gotten an abortion. 

I never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. I never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when I mentioned the sex, I called it ""consensual sex"". The police are still hounding me, I'm freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by CONTINUING to knowingly provide false information to the police (although I gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that I have Stockholm Syndrome and that's why I won't report my boyfriend, and I'm at a loss for what to do. 

I also know why she's having some weird witch hunt. My boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, I was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). I was not and in the session I said specifically told her that I never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that I was raped at his fraternity house. 

I've also started to get calls from the NYPD investigating the ""forced abortion"" and I'm freaking out and don't know what to do. This is serious. 

At this point in time I know that I need to get the police off my butt. Is there a way that would help me? Is a lawyer the best way to go? Also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? Is there a way to make sure she doesn't do this again? 


Edit: when the cops came the first time, I told them that she was completely falsifying everything and I gave them evidence. She is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so I'm not taken seriously. The last time the cops called was last night. ",legaladvice

[IL] Neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). Landlord hasn't done anything,"I rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex's parking lot is included in my rent. I have a parking pass that I display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

I have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. I have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. I have also kept a log of every time I notice this neighbor in my spot & when I've contacted my landlord. (For what it's worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he's gone to reserve it, so I don't think this is just confusion - I don't think he owns a spot at all).

This past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. I confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. I once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, I shouldn't have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

Well, apparently neighbor didn't listen, because last night he was in my spot again. I called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn't come or were talked out of it by him, because when I woke up this morning, his car was still there.

Additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an HOA, & my landlord always claims he'll ""notify them"" when I make a complaint about my neighbor. 

I'm growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as I pay for this spot. With that being said, I'd appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. What can I do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. What actions can I take to ensure my neighbor doesn't get me towed from a spot that I am authorized to use?

Update edit: I just spoke with the HOA. They confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn't even have a parking spot at all. HOA also said he should've never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won't happen again. Finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that I can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot. ",legaladvice

My sister is in some weird cult - MI,"No, that is not clickbait and I am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

Okay. So my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. She came across a Craigslist posting by a woman I'll refer to as Aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. I never saw the ad, but I remember my sister telling me about it at the time. She was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. So she began a correspondence with ""Aileen"". I did not live with my sister, I'm older by 5 years so I was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

So she ends up going to this place last August, I think, maybe early September. I have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. I was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""Aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. That right there was the first time I thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so I didn't push it.

Over time, the tone of her emails changed. She would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""Aileen"" much. Then it gradually became that ""Aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""Aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""Aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""Aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""Aileen"" made her take drugs. Seriously disturbing stuff. I told her she needed to get out of there, that I'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""Aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

I didn't know what to do at that point. I thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and I trusted her judgment at the time. It's not like I had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, I didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""Aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. Yes, I was tentatively concerned, is what I'm trying to say, but I felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

My sister emailed me yesterday and I don't feel like that is the case anymore. Something had happened and from what I was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""Aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. My sister was forced to participate in this. She seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. I don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

I stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but I couldn't figure anything out. I know my sister took a Greyhound to Lansing and Aileen picked her up from the bus station, so I think this freak show is probably in either Eaton, or Ingham but as to more specifics, I have no idea. I don't think my sister even knows. I have a hunch they're in, or around Mason because Aileen made the kids spend the night at Seven Gables, but other than that I'm coming up empty.

I know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but I really need to know what to do. How do I handle this situation?

[NC] My dog went missing a month ago and i found her on Facebook. The family that has her refuses to return her to me.

Here's the problem, when I asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. Stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because I took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". I told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

I found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. I found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. She is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

"[UPDATE] I have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! And my landlord's response was: ""If you don't like it- just move out!""","[Here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

I have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400CAD a month) in my apartment in Ontario, Canada.

&#x200B;

Based on all of the advice I received from the original post – here's what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200B;

**I managed to get onto my online hydro account – and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* I noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month I was consistently consuming around 2600 kWh. No matter the month – no matter if I was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* I also checked the specific weeks where I was on vacation. I was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- I paid around $70 for each week I was away. A total of $140 I paid when I wasn't even home for two weeks!
* Furiously, I called the hydro company and asked them to look further – she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual – it appeared as if the unit Is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* She also Informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**The inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* I was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* The Inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* The closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! Feeding hot water to all the units.
* To prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment – and we were still receiving hot water! Meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* Also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

After emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him – he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. We noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). After he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. I had to shower at the neighbor's house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200B;

**Yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to ""see what's going on.""** *My boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* Instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. He is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* My boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and FIX this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven't already done enough).
* The landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said ""**If you don't like it- just move out!""**

**I am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* Due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do – likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* Since my boyfriend and I are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with NO hot water – we turned the hot water back on… meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**My question to all of you:**

1. What do I do now?... Can I trust my landlord to 'solve' this issue on his own – even though his ""plumbers"" will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. What happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. Do I need a lawyer?

Thanks to all of you again – you have helped tremendously!

* I am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on Monday!

I took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""We stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

Corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. So I've been back to the same Walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. I wasn't yelling, or causing issues I just want the PS4 my wife purchased for our son for Christmas. 

So the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""I believe this man has been trying to scam us since Christmas Eve claiming his PS4 had books in the box"". Cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that I've been constantly dealing with and I get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

I again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

So the outcome? No PS4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and I cannot do a chargeback. If you are ever purchasing anything expensive from Walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. Merry Christmas Walmart.

"[WA] My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. Is there anything I can do?","Hi, so my life is falling apart.

As the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. They have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. I love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and I would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

She has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. I don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. The reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but I know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. As a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

I was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. I opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. I told him that if he did end up having custody I would want to be seeing her as often as possible as I consider her my family. He told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. I don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that I am too as a result. I slammed the door. I was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

So basically, I have a few questions:First, Can anything be done to stop him having custody? There are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research I have completed.

Third, at the very least, could I contend in a court that I have visiting rights to her? I'm not actually related to her, so I'm not sure what the standing is there.

Third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway I can straight up adopt my step sister? I have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, I have an apartment of my own, and I would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**EDIT: I want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

Thank you so so so much to anyone who responds to this. I'm at my wits end and I will do literally anything to keep my step sister close to me, and I don't care about the cost.",legaladvice
Update: My ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (Florida),"**EDIT:** Forgot to add this...My first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

Firstly I would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive PM's I received. It was really overwhelming (in a good way). A few people asked for an update so here it is.

So a lot has happened since I first posted. I called in to work while I was trying to get all this sorted. One of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. My husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. My daughter went to physiotherapy. Eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. I was against it but the court ruled against me.

I gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. On her second visit it happened again. This time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. The next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. The neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. They had to cut the brace off my daughter. My husband and his wife were arrested. They got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with CPS. My ex lost visitation and custody and I'm working on making it permanent. Unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. It set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. She needed surgery and is still recovering. She always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. I hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. Right now I'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. That's my update.",legaladvice

good news update! [CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"Mostly good news.

I worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

I got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. What my brother and I inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. My grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. She didn't do the same with mine before she died (I thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when I was old enough to know how to take care of them. There was no trust, she just trusted my dad. My dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. My dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

Dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. My brother found out I still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. That's how my brother found out I still had shares and they'd grown.

According to all that info my lawyer tells me I'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. I say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. The letter I received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

A week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. His girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. I felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures I might have given him some. The next morning I found all my tires had been slashed. Screw him, I don't feel bad any more.

The rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise I don't know nearly enough about what I'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. A lot of the decisions I've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because I knew it would but because I had no idea what I was doing and left it up to him. I've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what I have. Thanks for all your comments.",legaladvice
I found my 30 year old fiancé talking to 13 and 14 year old children. What is my next step?,"I apologize if this belongs in relationship advice but I am pursuing the legal route instead

I found messages on my fiancé's Snapchat account of him talking to two different people sexually and romantically. I took it upon myself to message each girl myself to get more information before I left him. Upon talking to them I discovered that one girl is 14 and one is 13. The 14 year old claims that my fiancé was willing to drive to her to have sex and that he also sent her explicit photos. I have no proof of these claims and neither does she due to him deleting his account and the profile is no longer able to be searched and messages cannot he retrieved. She also had one of my fiancé's best friends added to her Snapchat profile and was able to prove that his friend did send her sexually explicit photos of himself as well. 

We also have a one year old daughter who I am going to protect from him at any cost. What can I do to ensure this?

I have not contacted the police yet. I am not sure if a crime has been actually committed as I'm unfamiliar with the law. I just need help knowing how to get my ducks in a row and what my next step should be.",legaladvice
Banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat.,"in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I used to take the bus daily to get to work. Not a big deal, I'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

But every thursday was awful. Every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. Still, generally not an issue because I'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

But this bus company was not reliable. We have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. One day, a little school bus came instead. It had 9 seats. Since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. So you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

I have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. Considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, I needed that time to sit down. So, that's what I was doing, as always.

The group gets on the bus, I've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. I look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. I take out my earbuds and she says to me that I need to give up my seat. The other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when I tell her I need it she says that I need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. I try my best to explain that medically I can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says I'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). So after a couple minutes of this I snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as I'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. She gives me a look like I just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

Two days later when I tried to get on the bus I was told I was banned from the service.

When I called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. I explained the medical reasons I needed it and was simply told I have a lower priority because I'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as I ever knew. He ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as I know, but I feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

On my original post it was suggested a lot that I make a post here. I live in Ontario, Canada. I don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. I know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

Anyway that's why I'm here for help. Am I in the right to sue? For how much? I don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

EDIT: There's a lot of responses on here so I'm sorry if I don't get to everyone, but for now I will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the Ontario Human Rights Legal Support Center on Monday. Thanks everyone. I'll still be accepting further advice if there is more I should do though obviously I can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

EDIT: I gave them a call. It went well, should be covered from here. Thanks all.",legaladvice
"When I was hired I was given a key and told if I lose it I owe $15,000. I lost it. Do I have to pay up?","I am located in Michigan.  

Okay so when I was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) I was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  I was told that if I ever lost said key I would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

I have lost this key.  (It was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. I was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

So now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money I owe.""   I have received letters from their official letterhead and I am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. And they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

I have no intention of paying the fine.

The catch is that I was told this was the consequence verbally when I was handed the key.  My supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   I replied with ""to be clear, I will not be paying that if I haven't signed yet.  Do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  My supervisor laughed as though I was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

Well he never brought it up again and I of course did not either.  

My question is.  Can I be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" At this point I have not reminded them that I never signed.  I have simply ignored them.  But I worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and I'm not sure how to proceed.  I will be visiting my lawyer Monday.  So hopefully more answers then. 

$15,000 is about 1/3 of my yearly salary. I can not afford this ""charge.""

"Cousin confessed to falsely accusing my brother of rape. He was arrested, convicted and later committed suicide. I have her recorded confession. What should I do with it? (Arizona)","She accused him of rape years ago. She was 18 and he was 22. It was false and never happened. He was arrested and eventually convicted. When he served his stance and got out he was broken. From what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. He tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. His record, his name on the registry and lack of options. He went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. Within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

Yesterday was 3 years since his death. This cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. I said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. I went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. Also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). She told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. I asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

The voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

Are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? I want to make my brother's slate clean. Not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). His son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. If so, how do we begin the process? Do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

What consequences (criminal) will she face? Will she go to jail?

And, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? Of course this belongs to his son now although I don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). And can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? This conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

I know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair. So please help put me in the right direction.",legaladvice
[AZ] Discovered a video of my father raping me as a child,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder.

[MA] Man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. Now they won't take it off until he verifies that we don't live together. He's blocked my number.,"I bought a car last year from a mutual friend that I didn't know well at all. Everything was fine until this past June, when he fell into some heavy debt. He gave me a call sometime around June, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which I refused. Red flag number one right there. After this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than I should've been monthly for this car). I eventually just gave the car back and that was that. I gave the car back mid July and purchased a new one (Nissan Altima) from a legitimate dealer. This morning I received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. I calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don't live together, (we absolutely do not) I still have to pay it. This is absurd, how is this allowed? The guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can I provide proof for someone else? This is in Massachusetts and I have progressive insurance.


Update #1: okay so a lot has happened since I first posted. For starters, I should clarify some things. We signed an agreement that I would pay monthly increments for the title. Until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. Initially he said I would be under his insurance, but only a few days after I saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. I did not have the car in my name, which is why I was able to give it back so easily. I just thought ""screw this drama, I'll just get a new car."" Today my adjuster happens to be ""out sick"" but I reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. A representative of Progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. I have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. I've been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. I'm expecting a phone call and will update soon.

Update #2: Not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. Luckily I kept all of the text messages between us, which I attached to the reports I filed. With my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it's a bit difficult to get this taken care of. After I settle this, because I am NOT paying an extra $500, I will most definitely be switching providers.",legaladvice

I'm told by the end of the week I should be with an attorney who can begin helping me file everything I need to begin doing and hopefully begin tracking down where he's put all the money and get some back so I can continue to survive until I can be approved for childcare through state benefits and begin working again. 

I'm really surprised about how often this happens, there are entire places dedicated to helping men and women who have their wives/husband's do this to them. 

I am filing for divorce, before he can hopefully and for the return of the money into our account and an order to continue assisting with bills, child support and other necessities such as diapers, mortgage etc.

I probably will not have another update to this for a good long time but so many people wanted to make sure I was going to be OK and with everyone's advice to contact legal aid etc it looks like it hopefully might get better soon! I also contacted the bank and other bills that are coming up that I won't make and explained the situation. They are somewhat understanding and hopefully I'll be back at work soon to keep current.

I called 911 for a medical emergency and the police showed up and verbally harassed/threatened me. Should I file a complaint? (Pennsylvania),"I don't really know where to file this under flairs.

Tonight, I had to call an ambulance to my apartment. My boyfriend was acting erratic and seemed to be in psychosis. He then had a full-on seizure. 

Later on, I found out he smoked synthetic marijuana. I don't know much about that. I do not do drugs. I do not even smoke normal marijuana. I called an ambulance because I didn't know what else to do - I was scared. 

Three policemen showed up first and entered without knocking. Asked where he was. I started to cry and they told me to go in the other room as I was annoying them. I complied. Then, the larger of the three cornered me in the hallway.

He said my pupils were completely ""blown"" and I better start telling the truth about what drugs I do. I told him that I have incredibly poor eye sight and my pupils have been naturally large since childhood - this is true. He told me, ""stop fucking lying to me now or you're getting arrested for drug possession."" Again, I denied any drug use and told him he could literally drug test me through blood and urine at that exact moment - I am clean. He left me in the hallway and another man came out, rinse and repeat. Then the third did the same thing. They kept telling me to look at lights and laughing and saying I was the biggest liar they had ever met. At this point I'm amped up and scared. I am a 23 year old woman. I am in nursing school. I do not do drugs.

At this point, they have the ems there coming or and checking my pupils and laughing. They were telling my boyfriend that he better rat on both of us or we were both going to jail. They ripped apart my whole entire room and starting laying into me for having cipro prescribed (an antibiotic). The largest policeman then told me he was going to speak to my landlord and have me evicted.  I reiterated that I am completely clean and could pass not only a field sobriety test but a drug test of any kind. He retorted with ""I highly doubt that"" as he continued to tear apart my home.

Eventually, they got my boyfriend into the ambulance and all three of the cops left laughing. The largest turned around and said, ""Congratulation on ruining your life. don't call an ambulance when you are on drugs, I'll see you around"".

Not only am I shaken, but I feel threatened and ashamed. The man I was with should not have been on anything, but I called an ambulance because I was scared he might die! I didn't call them to be harassed. Did they even do anything really wrong that I can report this? We live in a small town in NEPA. I know that they heard a possible drug incident over the scanner and had three of them show up because they thought they'd find a good amount of drugs/an incident of interest. They found absolutely nothing. No one got arrested or charged. They also refused to give me any badge numbers and told me if I kept inquiring I'd be in more trouble.

My coworker admitted to making false reports against my ex-boyfriend to get him disqualified from becoming a police officer.,"About 6 months ago, my boyfriend was permanently disqualified during his application process to become a police officer. It was very odd as he's never had any legal trouble, he's never done drugs, there was really no reason to be disqualified. He has a criminal justice degree, he volunteered with the police department and he has background in security. The police refused to disclose why he was disqualified.

Well after hanging out with a mutual coworker, he very openly told me he was trying to ruin my boyfriends life and he filed a report saying my boyfriend threatened him and was very temperamental and aggressive and that he was scared of him. They worked together and went to highschool together. 

He then told me to make sure I told my boyfriend because he wanted to start a physical altercation in order to get him arrested. He even told my boyfriend's brother, but he didn't say anythin because he didn't want to cause a fight. 

I feel like I'm in a very bad position. Would showing the police our texts possibly get the disqualification reversed? Is there anything I can do legally? It's been about 6 months since the disqualification and I'm in arizona.

Edit: I wanted to add, his reasoning for doing this is because he wanted to also ruin our relationship because he wanted to be with me.",legaladvice

He then tells me that he has a bunch of friends and family canvassing the neighbourhood looking for him. Great right? This is where things get unpleasant.

It's -10C outside and as it gets later and my search gets wider I realize that i'm the only one looking for my dog. I call [rover.com](https://rover.com) repeatedly and they say that all they can do on their end is encourage the sitter to go out and look, but apart from that their hands are tied. I get a tip from Facebook that a dog similar to mine was brought in to TAS, but I needed to call them for a more accurate description. I call TAS when they open on Sat morning at 8am, and discover that it isn't my dog. At that point they inform me that they never received a missing dog report for my dog the night before, and that I would have to submit one myself. (+12h after he went missing) This is the first confirmed lie from this dog sitter.

I continue my search throughout the morning with no leads, I double back into the neighbourhood and still don't see any missing posters or anyone else searching. I finally get a tip off to his location through Facebook and catch up with my dog at a park that he is semi-familiar with around lunch time. This is after 17h straight of walking in -10C weather. I covered every street & alleyway in a 3 sq kilometer area because I was scared to death that my dog was going to get hit by a car and/or freeze to death. I couldn't stand the thought of going home without him.

I speak to [rover.com](https://rover.com) again, and on a hunch ask for the missing poster order number and location. It turns out they were never collected from the Staples that printed them. So this guy never had any posters in his possession and was never distributing them. I have them now as evidence.

&#x200B;

Emotions aside, is there any course of action I can take to deal with this person? By lying about the search, the posters and the TAS report he delayed valuable search tools that I could have procured myself and used in the search immediately. I also lost $1000 by breaking this work contract and have documentation to that effect. 

This guy really should not have any animal in his care, and pretending to go through the motions is worse than simple negligence like leaving a door unsecured. I'm at a loss for how to proceed. (If at all) 

Edit: to clarify I did eventually find my dog, he's safe but it was a hellish experience.

Update: [FL]Neighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent,"Link to original post in case you need it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants\_cutting\_down\_my\_magnolia\_trees/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants_cutting_down_my_magnolia_trees/?context=10)

I've received a number of messages begging for an update, but as it's only been a few months, I can only give a partial one, due to the ongoing legal issues (my attorneys have advised me not to divulge too much to anyone).

1) The day after my post, I called a good friend of mine who has been my go to plumber since I inherited the property (we went to high school together), to ask for his help. He went to both houses the next day, saying that I had called him last week since the water bill seemed high, and asked him to come look at the pipes. He went through the houses, surreptitiously taking pictures, while ""inspecting"" the bathrooms/kitchens/water boilers, etc for leaks. Apparently while he was there they made a bunch of comments about me that included racial slurs (tldr: i'm biracial, and do not pass for white) and such about how I need to learn my place. After he'd inspected both houses he came over to mine, and gave me all the photos.

2) I conferred with an attorney regarding evicting them, and four days later both families were served with 7 day eviction notices. As expected, they blew up, and started throwing rocks at my house, slinging more racial epithets in my direction. I'd always grown up being terrified of angry racist white men twice my size, I never realized how unbelievably pathetic they actually are until I watched them crying like babies while being hauled off by the police on the video cameras.

3) The bride made a very angry post on facebook, followed up by standing up in church (small town, most of us go to the same church) during ""prayers and concerns"" to beg for prayers for her family because ""Our landlord is evicting all of us because she's jealous that I'm getting married!"" The pastor, feigning innocence, said ""I thought she was evicting you all because your father and \[Groom\]'s father cut down \[My Great-Grandmother\]'s prize magnolias?"" Hardest game of You-Laugh-You-Lose I've ever played, still proud I survived.

4) According to the arborists (yes plural. though my friend came out and did an assessment, my attorney for the suit over the trees advised selecting someone who isn't so close to me for the paperwork we'll submit to the court), based on the number of trees cut down and the number of trees damaged beyond repair, and how old/well-tended those trees were, the value of the trees alone is more than i could sell all three houses for in the current housing market around here. Then the attorney started talking about how the damages are multiplied and let's just say I would be quite happy with half that number, but I know when to zip my lips so I'll let my attorneys handle the negotiating.

5) They did, in fact, destroy the houses as best they could. I have enough savings/inheritance left that I can live without the rents for a while, so I'm using it as an excuse to have both houses renovated since they haven't had major renovations since well before I was born.

6) The bride and groom got married and had their reception in the church basement instead of the cul-de-sac. They had to cancel the honeymoon to spend the money on legal fees. (Am I a bad person for being amused?)

7) Hurricane Michael just gave me some wild thunderstorms, thankfully passed over us with the worst of it.

8) My boyfriend of seven years proposed (finally, goddamn).

I do want to take a moment to thank you all for thinking of me, and being so helpful with your advice with what was a terrifying ordeal at the time.

[MA] A restaurant manager purposefully switched out my celiac boyfriend's non-gluten meal with a normal one due to her disbelief that he was intolerant,"So I wrote about this last night just after it happened on another subreddit, and was advised by many of the comments to post here for some clarity on what recourse we could actually seek from this.

I won't be writing out the whole incident again in as much detail as before, but if anyone reads my earlier post and thinks I've missed out something crucial, I'll be happy to edit the post.

My boyfriend and I went out for lunch yesterday at a restaurant we have dined at before. My boyfriend is a diagnosed celiac and has been for many years, and when this place was recommended to us originally we were told the restaurant has specific gluten free items, and a specific area where such food was prepared to avoid cross contamination. We had a great time, and checked online before going back again yesterday and saw there were no complaints about people being 'glutened'. We arrived and ordered our meals, with my boyfriend specifically ordering a gluten free appetizer and entree, something that the waitress stated would come with a different sauce than advertised as the usual sauce was made in the general area of the kitchen and as such could be contaminated.

We have no issues until the entrees come, when my boyfriend is served a dish of pasta with the advertised sauce. The waitress thinks that there's been a mix up in the kitchen, and comes back a minute later to say that someone else has received his gluten free pasta and the kitchen were rushing out a new order. She said she'd comp our appetizers and try to get us a free dessert, something she'd have to check with the shift manager on first. We see her go over to someone we assume is the manager, and then minutes later the manager storms over and asks us what kind of scam we're pulling. She says that the pasta was definitely gluten free, and we tell her that because of my boyfriend's celiacs we were told that the normal sauce wasn't safe and were waiting on a new dish with a new sauce. She started to complain about fad eating and sensitive customers (something we attributed to us being young and therefore 'millennials'). The waitress came over with the new dish with the new sauce, but the manager snatched it from her and started to walk it back into the kitchen saying that the 'precious table' couldn't be served something that she hadn't checked. She came back a few minutes later with what we assumed was the same dish and wouldn't give it over to my boyfriend initially, sarcastically asking if she wasn't us to drag away the chef from their job and tell us ourselves it was safe. We said it was fine, and rushed to finish so we could get out of there, probably finishing our meals in about 10 minutes.

We flagged down our original waitress and asked for the check. She was a little while, and when she came back to us she looked like she'd seen a ghost. She told us that she'd gone back to the kitchen to check on another order, and noticed a pasta dish that looked exactly like the one my boyfriend had eaten sitting on the side. She asked if it needed to go out, and was told that it was the one the manager had brought back about 15 minutes before. The waitress said that she thought it had been brought back out to the customer, but was told that the manager had only come in and asked the chef working with pasta dishes to simply drain some normal, gluten-containing pasta and serve it with the gluten free sauce (my boyfriend had ordered a tortellini style dish and there was a similar one on the regular menu, so he wouldn't have noticed by appearance or taste alone).

The waitress had comped all of the food on our check, but I insisted that we paid for my dishes, and tipped her well over the average, just in case she was penalised for the manager's mistakes. She went above and beyond what was necessary by telling us the truth to help us in preparing for my boyfriend's future 'glutened' state.

My boyfriend started having a reaction just before we got home, and spent the rest of the evening locked in the bathroom having a serious response to eating a whole bowl of gluten. As of this morning the worst is over, but he is still having serious stomach pains that will be occurring for the next few weeks at the very least.

On my original post, I was given many different types of advice; I was told to both post and not post a scathing review, to sue and not sue the restaurant, and to get the police involved over a 'poisoning' incident or just go all vigilante on the manager. As I have been looking after my boyfriend all night, I have not been able to research any further, legal ways of dealing with this. As a note, my boyfriend has not and will not be going to the ER or doctor about this - we already have everything we could possibly need to manage this, and it would simply be wasting time and money. However, if people advise that we need medical 'proof', we will be happy to pursue that.


TL;DR - My celiac boyfriend was purposely 'glutened' by an irate manager who didn't believe he needed a specialist meal, who and what should we pursue to get this manager fired and the restaurant investigated?",legaladvice
"UPDATE: I am a forgotten employee who has been ""working"" for over a year. I got found out.","I post this a year ago. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5psadr/i_have_become_a_forgotten_employees_for_a_few/

Since that time I got denied for the second job and basically been coasting by until I landed another position and turned in my two weeks notice. 

Recently I found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what I used to do, and pays more. Basically tired of doing nothing even though Im getting paid for it.  

The day after I mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office I got a phone call exactly at 8 AM. The head of HR for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. I asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. She stated that there were no issues like that. They just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

I told her that they should have that information as head of HR and promptly disconnected stating I had to return back to work. She called back at 12:05 exactly. 

I have been ducking her calls ever since. Her voicemails state that I am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. My emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. Each time I am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. She calls at least once per day. 

I am thinking I just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away. 

How incredibly bad is that plan? Before anyone says it. I know... I know ok I should have quit a long time ago. I did not.

My fiance, now husband did pull through! He's currently in our backyard setting up a tent to ""camp out"" with our 2 and 3 year old boys.

He was appalled by his sisters actions when I finally discussed it with him.

I really appreciate all of the sweet thoughtful messages I was sent. They definitely made me feel better on bad days to know how many people were praying for him! ",legaladvice
I adopted a dog. They said they gave me the wrong dog even though the photos match. Now the adoption clinic is trying to sue me.,"I live in Texas and I recently adopted a puppy from a humane society several hours from my house. Before arriving I paid the adoption fees via a phone call and then arrived and filled out adoption papers for the good girl. However the next day the clinic called and said that they had accidentally given me the wrong dog and that I needed to return her as some other family had also filled out the adoption papers for her to which I refused. they then said they were going to press legal action on the basis of ""stolen property"" if I didn't return with her within 24 hours. The dog I adopted is clearly the dog within the online photos that were posted for her and they handed her over to me without checking her chip..They said that they could be sued if I didn't bring her back and they didn't check the tags so are they not at fault for giving out the wrong dog?

The puppy I adopted is clearly the same as the one in the photos posted online and I've already bonded with her, taught her tricks and introduced her to my entire family over the last several weeks she's been staying with me. They say that even if I return her they still want me to pay their attorneys fees. Please help me anyone I don't want to lose my dog and I don't feel like I'm at fault for their mistakes.

Edit: the large amount of responses is greatly appreciated. It's an incredible help to me to be receiving many different perspectives on the scenario as well as slightly reaffirming to know that many believe the courts would be sympathetic to my stance in the situation. I am a young man recently graduated from high school and have never faced such a level of legal threat before and was honestly in a panic about what to do.

"Boyfriends ankle monitor is dying, his charger isn't working and no one from the house arrest company will pick up. What should we do??","Trying to get this update out there proved to be harder than I thought. So I put my update here. 

OP is still published at the bottom of this post

I know a lot of people were concerned about the reason behind my boyfriends house arrest sentence. Which led to an entire post on r/bestoflegaladvice being dedicated to how gullible, stupid and naive I must be for believing his reasoning. Whelp! He got off house arrest on Tuesday (9/10) ((yay!! :)), I asked if he would mind if I uploaded his ""certificate of completion"" to reddit and he said that was fine.

[Certificate of Completion ](https://imgur.com/a/BY974wg)

A few people asked some really good questions so I'm going to try to be as clear as possible:

He really was not on probation or parole. When he went to trial he was given the option to ""complete the program,"" which was a year with a PRIVATELY OWNED house arrest company. If he failed to complete the program he would be sentenced to three years in prison.

The terms of his house arrest, as per the company's rules, where that he was allowed one grocery store trip a week and needed to provide sign-in and sign-out sheets for his daily work shifts. He could not leave the house otherwise unless explicitly approved by the owner of the company. Every other week he was required to ""check in,"" which means he had to go into the house arrest place, sit down with someone, and provide receipts for his trips to the store as well as all of his work slips to prove that he was at the locations doing what he was supposed to be doing. He had to pay the company $60/week to be on house arrest with them (which was quite an expense but definitely better than prison). 

Now that he has completed the program, he hands over his certificate to a judge to show that he served his time and he is now eligible to reapply for a drivers license (which was obviously revoked when he was ""sentenced"" due to DUS charges).

He was never on parole. He was never on probation. This entire ordeal was due to being a ""habitual traffic offender."" A year of house arrest. For driving without insurance. He could not afford the insurance and was driving to get to work, to afford the insurance, he even switched up cars every time he drove. Does ANY of that make what he did okay? Absolutely not. But I did want to provide proof for those who were concerned that that is why he was put on house arrest and for no other reason.

TL;DR: My boyfriend was sentenced to a year on house arrest due to traffic violations, no other reason. He has completed the program and now we're going to the beach.

Thank you for coming to my TEDtalk I hope this cleared things up. Sorry for the lengthy post.

OP:

Title explains it all. What is our best course of action to prevent him from going to prison if his monitor dies before they open in the morning? I suggested maybe filming himself sitting at home for proof he didn't go anywhere. He thinks maybe he should call the police and go into the station so that he can be supervised, maybe put in a holding cell overnight so that he has witnesses that he didn't go anywhere. 

Time is a factor. What do we do??

Edit: thanks everyone for your feedback. He called, left a voicemail, sent a text, sent a video recording of the monitor and charger not working (he has been on house arrest for 11.5 months we definitely know what it looks like when it's supposed to be charging)((he gets off sep. 14! :)), his supervisor has an iPhone so we even shared his location with them. Everything we could think of.


At 12:29am we got this text back:
""Sorry so late.. I have been traveling today and not near a computer or cell coverage. I looked it up and it should have showed you on charge but hasn't. Either it's not connected or charger not working. Still showing low battery. Call the office at 9 and talk to greg about it. I'm sorry.""

Crisis averted. Sounds like we'll just stay put until the office opens and then we'll go in to get everything checked, and we'll be sharing his iPhone location with them until then.

I would like to take a moment to address a few frequently asked questions:
1. We are in South Carolina.
2. He is not on probation or parole. He has never in his life been convicted of a crime. He was actually put on house arrest because he acquired too many traffic violations (none of which were DUIs, which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous).
3. The house arrest company is a privately owned business. There is a man and wife who charge every person they keep on house arrest $60/WEEK. Capitalism ladies and gentlemen.

Thanks again for everything and if anything changes I'll let y'all know.

Final edit: we went in to the house arrest place today after they opened, they gave him a new monitor, a new charger, a back up charger still in the box, and even knocked 4 days off his sentence!!! Horribly, horribly stressful event had a relatively happy ending. Thank you everyone who took the time to read and reply.

EDITEDIT: people are getting pretty mean, this got way out of hand. I want to genuinely thank everyone who responded to this post with helpful information when we were in need of advice, and our issue has resolved since then. I may make a separate post with all of the interesting information and developments that came about as a result of this once I get some more organized/tangible information, but honestly it's late and hate mail takes a lot out of you. Thanks again to everyone who was sincere and wanted to help.


Absolutely, positively, nonnegotiable final edit: Okay kids, it's been a long day. We laughed, we cried, we learned a lot about ourselves. But at the end of the day, after grilling him, background searching him, and even calling his mom, it has become abundantly and unquestionably clear that my bf's current house arrest sentence is 100% due to three DUS (driving under suspension) arrests. He was pulled over driving without insurance, three times. Irresponsible? Oh absolutely, he's known from the beginning how I feel about it. But, he is not, nor has he ever been, 1)in prison 2)on parole or 3)on probation. The disconnect was the difference between arrested and convicted, that is where I was confused and as a result confused some of y'all. He had been arrested several times when he was in his teens (a very, very long time ago) and all of them were for dumb teen stuff like petty shoplifting, which he never went to prison for. Was that stuff irresponsible? Yes. Illegal?? Also yes. But a long long time ago and entirely unrelated to his current house arrest sentence? You betcha. We had a good laugh about how dumb he was as a teen, he remembered a lot and I learned a lot. To everyone saying I'm dumb for believing him about his current situation: you had me really questioning things for a minute there and I'm sorry to disappoint you but that's all there is to it. He will be getting off house arrest on September 10th, and to celebrate we're going to the beach. The end.",legaladvice
MyLife.com has a profile on me with identifying information. Their website falsely claims I have a criminal record. Isn't that technically libel?,"Long story short, I googled myself and saw the first result was a link to a webpage for a company called MyLife.

It's a little more disturbing to see them falsely claiming that I have a criminal record, which is the first result for anybody who Googles my name.

[RESOLVED NE] HOA tried to take my land,"So after 6 long months, everything been resolved. This is my final post regarding this, already asked my lawyer if I could post this and he said go ahead. 

So here's my last update:  

https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7go96c/ne_hoa_towed_away_my_car_and_built_a_chainlink/


So the HOA board got a lawyer to respond to my C&D and they requested a meeting ASAP with my lawyer present as well. I didn't want to go but my lawyer suggested me hear them out at atleast. At the meeting, I noticed there president and some of the higher ups were not there. 

The board had no idea what the hell was happening and their lawyer was just as confused as them. After I laid out my timeline of events they thanked me for my time accepted all the financial burden of replenishing my pond, missing car (couldn't locate it), and damages. 

I got checks for everything and got my pond restored back in April and didn't really think much of it. 

I found out a few weeks ago from the new HOA president. Turns out the old president, tresaurer and someone else had been stealing money from the coffers. They wanted my land to expand and put in a pool, clubhouse and etc just as I saw on their website. The old board fined everyone a ton of money to get all the cash together and buy my land. Instead they spent it on themselves. They needed my land somehow so they thought they could just take over the land I wasn't using.


Long story short, their entire plan fell apart after I fought back and brought to the other members of the HOA attention what they were doing. From what I've been told, they had to sell their house to pay back the HOA and have since moved away. The HOA has offered me market value for my land and I do plan on selling since I really don't use the land for anything and the money isn't bad.

I did not file any complaints with the Postal inspector or anything, since the situation resolved itself. I got a new project car and for those asking it was a '98 Supra with a bad engine. My new project is a '67 Fastback that I plan on restoring to look like Elanor. :)

[UPDATE][Oregon] Neighbor cut down trees on my property,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/


Hello legal advice community! I have not forgotten about you, who helped set me on the path to justice! I'll get right to it. I can't speak to all the details, and I'm sorry about not continuing to update (after everything got underway I figured it would be best not to). To keep it short, we (my lawyer and I) spoke to the police, who then spoke to the neighbors down and across the street (the one who witnessed my trees getting cut down) who stated they saw the neighbor and the company cutting down the trees, and then finally they spoke to him (neighbor). I don't know much beyond that with the criminal investigation, what happened with the whole city document or the company, and why that is will be explained below.


I hauled his ass into court. Well, first, the arborist came, as did the surveyor. The trees were on my property and they were white oaks. The arborist gave me an estimate on having 15 mature white oaks brought and replanted on my property, which was just shy of $650,000, though he did say some trees would die and that would drive the cost up. I also had my property appraised, for the difference before and after losing my trees. It then became a question of whether I wanted to pursue my lost trees and see how much their lumber was worth, or sue for the replacement cost and loss of property value. Basically, do I want the trees back or do I want the cost of the ones I lost? (apparently you can't have both).

Well guys...

I PICKED THE TREES.

The actual court stuff started a lot sooner than I thought. We filed, a few weeks passed, and a few days before our day in court his lawyer reached out with a settlement offer. Apparently he was wealthier than I thought. We accepted and while I can't speak to the details of it...

I'M GETTING THE TREES BACK!

It's going to take a long time apparently (several months, possibly all the way until September since the process didn't start until just this week due to the Holidays), but I will have all 12 trees back on my property at no cost to me! My neighbor has also put his house up for sale, and I haven't seen him for quite some time now. Oh well! There's a bit more to the settlement, but I don't feel comfortable speaking to that, hopefully that's understandable.

I remember some of the comments about whether the trees were a hazard to the road based on how far they were from the road. I ended up having to check with the county (not the city), and they sent someone out to measure and mark the boundaries. My trees were at least 5 feet beyond it (so outside the boundary). Not even close! Just thought I'd add that in.


Anyways, there it is! I plan to take photos of the trees once they start getting put in, and of course once they are all in place and I have them back. I'll be sure to share them! I want to thank everyone for all their advice, it was a huge help! I didn't know you all were so into trees, but I'm glad you are!

My abusive ex sold my house without my knowledge,"I inherited my mom's house when she died. A couple years ago, my then boyfriend moved in with me.

"mother in law suing my wife for ""grandparent rights""","So today in the mail we received a letter from the county court of where my mother in law lives and she is suing us for ""grandparent rights"" a little back story.

\*Courts based in upstate NY\*

Over the last almost 8 years me and my wife have been  together her parents always have despised me cause i was a punk city boy and my wife was a good country girl. We moved in after 6 months and have been happy together since. we got married back in 2015 so we are coming up on a 4 year anniversary and things got better for awhile until we bought our first house and i got a job where i started making a lot of money. me and my wife now live a very comfortable life nice cars house etc.

Back on thanksgiving of last year is when shit hit the fan. Her mother said some very hurtful stuff about me and my wife to my brother in laws girlfriend, my wife and her are very close so she tells her everything and once the beans were spilled my wife confronted her mother about it. Her mom made every excuse under the sun instead of just saying sorry she was wrong (we know she said it because there was text proof). We haven't talked to her only once or twice since thanksgiving.

Today we received a letter in the mail from her county court suing for grandparent rights everything i have read they can only sue if we are ""unfit"" to be parents. My wife and i don't have any alcohol, drug problems, or trouble with the law we have been happily married for almost 4 years and our kids are well taken care of no debt etc. We also never once stated ever she could not see the children not verbally or over text. We just sold our house yesterday expected close is early May and then we are moving to South Carolina this has been a plan for years and we finally acted on it back in December.

Does she have any ground to stand on? Does NY have any laws to that effect where they could force us to give them the kids for visitation? Can this stop our move from happening and screw up the sale of my house? Any advice is much appreciated.

Suicidal best friend checked herself into a facility while she recovers. She requested I take care of her children (1m 3f). Her family took them instead against her wishes. (UT),"My best friend is a single mom. The other day she had a mental breakdown and became suicidal. She has made an attempt on her life in the past years and years ago and knew if she didn't get help immediately, she would kill herself, and so she went directly to the emergency room. She has been moved to a behavioral health unit while she recovers mentally and is ready to go home.

She has requested that I take care of her children while she is gone. We are very close and her children love me. She trusts me completely with them. We have plans to move in together in soon. I am not a parent, but I have the means to take care of them and they would be happy.

I received an unnanounced visit from some of her family members (grandmother and cousin). They wanted to watch the children for a little bit. I was fine with this as I wanted to visit my friend to see how she was doing and stock up on food and supplies for the children. My friend was very upset that I let her cousin watch her children and requested I pick them up as soon as possible. She has always had difficulty with trusting her family and didn't want her cousin parenting her children.

Her family doesn't want to return the children to me. They claim they are worried about child protective services stepping in. They believe/claim if the children are found in custody of a friend rather than family member that the children would be taken as custody of the state.

What can I do in this case? Her children are in no way neglected and would be completely safe and cared for by me. I have taken time off work and will be with them 24/7. She even wants the children to be with me and not them. Does her will not matter to CPS? Would they actually take the children if found in care from a non family member? Or would I be completely fine caring for her children?

**Edit: I have received a lot of great advice. Thank you! I will be going to get the children asap. Many of you suggested getting the delegation of parental authority completed. I can attempt to do so but she is only allowed an hour of visitation per day. She also has no idea what is currently happening with her children and with her mental state I am worried of giving her extra stress knowing that I am having difficulty getting them back. Should I continue to have difficulty, I will have to get her to help with getting the documents signed. I would like to keep this as peaceful with her family as possible, which it has been so far. I understand their concern about CPS and I'm hoping that the advice I receive will help convince them that they have no need to be worried and CPS won'tbe an issue. Should I show them my home and that I am 100% capable of caring for the children to alleviate their concerns?**

**Edit 2: I have the children back. I talked with their mother on the phone and she assured me CPS was a non-issue. She even insured that her family were not listed as caregivers, and another close friend of hers is. Her friend is with me in this and believes I am fully fit to have them. Still facing a lot of opposition towards me having them and I'm working through getting the proper paperwork signed.**

**Edit 3: Thread has been locked but I have received plenty of helpful advice. Thank you for all of your well wishes. I have pumped up an air mattress for them as all the beds in my home are really tall, and they love it. The 3 year old calls it her balloon bed. I also found pillows that look like eyeballs and they think it'sthe coolest thing their bed has eyes. I am so happy to have them and relieved that they will be safe with me as we wait for their mother to return home.**",legaladvice
Kid reached over the wall and filmed my daughter while she was crying in a bathroom stall at school (6th grade) in Texas. The kid then posted the video to social media.,"That happened about two weeks ago.  It was initially pushed down to a guidance counselor as a ""friends issue"".  My wife went to the school about a week ago because the issue had yet to be resolved; a group of girls were still picking on our daughter.  Since then, one the assistant principals conducted an investigation.  The girl that did the recording is still running around the campus with her phone, and now our daughter is labeled a snitch and bullied even more because of the way the school has handled it.

Needless to say, we're a bit pissed.  Our daughter won't be going back to that school.  We're not really sure what to do next.  Do any of you fine folks out there have any advice on a way ahead?

Edit: Forgot to mention two important details:
1. The kid that did the recording...she admitted to doing it in a written statement to the school. She denied posting it to social media, but other kids have told our daughter they saw the video posted on music.ly.

2 .  Our daughter has a 504 plan for anxiety and PTSD.",legaladvice

[Update] My father got my 14 year old sister pregnant.,"A lot has happened since I posted.

I talked with my sister for a long time over the next week and she eventually agreed to talking to an adult at school. I went with her to talk to a teacher she was close with. After a lot of crying together she called the police and our school counselor and principal. They basically didn't let us go home that day from school. 

We ended up getting a case worker and parents of my sister's best friend (NOT the mom who was constantly harassing us about going public) took us in temporarily. We are currently still with them. 

The police visited my dad who won't admit to raping me or my sister, but they found a ton of child porn on his computer and other things they wouldn't tell us about. He has been arrested for the child porn. Unfortunately, that did make the news and everyone knows. It's extremely embarrassing and stressful to have people judge you all the time. People wouldn't shut up about it for like two weeks. 

My sister moved to a different school that helps with troubled kids and special situations for while she is pregnant. We are hoping she can go back after she has the baby and continue at her first school... Ideally.. 

She and I both have gone through a lot of counseling and she is okay giving up the child for adoption now. Our case worker and counselor are both really great about this whole thing.  Mom is still not in the picture.

I fully plan on changing my name to my mom's maiden name and so does my sister. My case worker says that's completely possible for us to do. Thanks for that advice reddit, I got that from here. 

Anyway, thanks for the advice. It helped me talk her into how serious it was.

"[Update] ""My work's fun committee ignored reasonable request, HR told me to pound sand.""","https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8826mu/ny_my_works_fun_committee_ignored_reasonable/

(New York)

A lot has happened over the last ten days.

I realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  I cannot live like this anymore.  And I mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

I was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that I was completely prepared to just stop living because I was too scared to find help.  So I went and found help.  

I took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, I found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  I've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

When I finally went back to work, I took the head of the Fun Committee aside and talked to her.  I explained to her that I have PTSD and some very severe anxiety issues and I apologized for not being more clear to her when I asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

And she cried.  She wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought I was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

Then, I spoke to my Manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where I can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  It is literally all I have ever wanted.

So, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  Apparently.

Hello Legal Advice!

So, here's some backstory:

Me and my fiancé moved into this new place back in April. We've been living here since then. The town I live in is incredibly small and only has around 150-200 people, maybe more. The cops around here are notorious for pulling people over. There is a major highway that runs between here and Cincinnati. They are most always out on that road because the city jurisdiction extends across that highway, they almost are never monitoring what's happening in town. 

Fast forward until now. There was a cop sitting at the 4 way in the middle of town that my fiancé had passed (she works with horses and drives a truck that's kinda loud). She was pulled over (in our driveway) for this exhaust issue. She took the loud exhaust ticket, paid it, we put a new exhaust that helped quiet down the truck, all is good. Right? Nah.

Now, this guy knows where we live. He drives by all the time and he knows when my fiancé leaves for work. He follows me now, in my 2010 Honda Civic (it's a completely legal car, no real reason for him to be following me) all the time as I do the speed limit, pay my taxes and abide by the law. There is an abandoned house across the road where he will sit at and ""clock"" people, however, it's right across from our home.

Today was the last straw. When my fiancé was leaving for work, we was headed in from town from picking up our cat from the vet. He is sitting at the 4-way stop sign in town. He sees us and makes eye contact with us and then as I'm almost home begins pulling out. My fiancé needed to go to work, so I decided to let her use my car so that way there was no risk of her being pulled over in her truck (even though we fixed the exhaust like he asked).

On her way out, he sees her leaving and pulls up and blocks the driveway, not allowing my fiancé to leave. He sits there for about a minute and then drives down the road a bit, waiting for her to pull out so he can stop her. She calls me and says she's afraid to leave, so I tell her to stay for a bit. He eventually pulled off and pulled over another loud truck.

Here's the kicker. My ring doorbell has the entire occurrence of him blocking our driveway on camera. I've saved a copy to my phones storage. What can we do about this? This is clearly harassment and this guy doesn't let up. It's a shame when I'm fearful to leave the privacy of my home because this guys following us around in an unusual way. Is there any way I can make a city complaint against him to get him to stop? I only fear this will make things a lot worse. Cops are meant to protect and serve, not harass and observe. 

Feeling lost here, could anyone give me some useful advice?

Thanks, sorry for the long post.",legaladvice
Minor Daughter Refuses Abortion.,"TW: Sex, Minor

&#x200B;

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm still shook and my boyfriend and I have been freaking out since we found out. I'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

Our daughter is 11 years old. We found out she was pregnant. She had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. We never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

It was clear she had a crush on him, but I never thought anything of it. Until she started complaining about things, I'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when I had been pregnant. 

I didn't jump to the conclusion, but I did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

They'd been having sex. God knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. I won't go in to details. Because I never wanted to imagine them myself. 

We had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. My boyfriend was fuming after I told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

They knew as much as we did of the whole thing. They were as shocked as we were. We've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

But she keeps saying she wants a baby. And I just don't fucking know what to do. I tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  I was trying to be level headed. But she didn't seem to understand at all. We've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

What can I do? Is the boy, or his parents liable? What can a doctor do? Can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?  
I'm at such a fucking loss. My world is crumbling.

I think my coworker's disabled son is stalking me. What options do I have? (OK)," I'm a high school teacher. I work in a very rural, very small school  and have been here for 15 years. ""Dan,"" my ""across the hall mate"" has  been here 8. His son,""Leo"" has some serious development issues, and  attended the school until he graduated three years ago. Leo was somewhat  of a legend at the school. Since Dan was the football coach, Leo would  serve as a manager at the games and the kids treated him well. Leo would  often visit his dad's classroom before and after school and I got to  know him as well. Leo became somewhat independent after graduation and  is able to hold down a very basic, part-time job that he can ride his  bike to from his home.

This past summer, Dan and his wife went on a three week vacation for  their anniversary. They asked me if I would be a source of support for  Leo while they were away. While Leo was okay to stay by himself, he  cannot drive, so I would take him to get groceries and drive him to work  if it was raining. I also checked in on him every day with a text or a  call. The last day I was to be in this role, Leo sent me a VERY  inappropriate text that included a photo of his penis. I told Leo that  was inappropriate and that I would be telling his father.

I showed Dan the text and he claimed that Leo's phone must've been  ""hacked"" or ""played with"" while Leo was at work. I didn't believe that  explanation, but I accepted it and moved on. The next day, my phone  started blowing up with texts from Leo (more than 100 inside 4 hours)  asking me if he could ""hold on to me"" and ""take me for a ride on his 4  wheeler"" and ""kiss me gently."" I forwarded the texts to Dan and did not  response to Leo.

Dan came to my house the next day and said that Leo was not sending  those texts. He said he was going to take the phone and see what  happens. Then, I started getting texts through some ""unknown number""  that were the same in tone and writing. A selfie of Leo nude was also  sent. I called Dan, thinking this might be something happening at Leo's  job or something.

This didn't stop. I was getting 100s of texts a day from different  numbers. As soon as I blocked one, another popped up. I went down to the  store where Leo worked and spoke with the manager. (I taught all of his  children). He told me that Leo had been spending a lot of time on a  coworker's phone and he had already talked to Dan about it two weeks  ago! So, Dan knew this was happening and did nothing.

I changed my number, then school started and everyone was sent  contact information for all teachers. This included my new number. Dan,  being in my department and a member of the faculty, got this  information. The next thing I know, I'm getting crazy texts again. I  said something to Dan at work. Dan said Leo was ""harmless"" and I should  just respond to him because he liked me and the more I avoid him, the  more miserable it makes Leo. Dan even said those days that my number  stopped working Leo became very angry and Dan had to give him  medication.

Last night, when I got home from work, my kids told me that Leo had  come by looking for me. I was surprised that he had ridden his bike all  the way out here. The kids said he arrived in a car, but not Dan's car.  My son guessed it was an Uber. I don't want to sound like a paranoid  nut, but this whole thing is unsettling. 

Am I being stalked?  
Am I being unsympathetic to Leo's problems?  
Is it wrong of me to expect Dan to manage his son's problems?  
What do I do next? 

I'm not going anywhere, and I doubt Dan is, so we will be ""across the hall mates"" for another 10 years…

Officially as of today Jane has vacated my apartment, and building management has changed the locks. We were able to come to a signed agreement where she agreed to vacate the property within 7 days if i refunded her last two months of rent. (\~4200$). Which i did. Honestly between this and my other legal fees i am basically in the hole, and i would have been better off not having anyone rent my apartment. 

I talked to someone who is doing a story on Jane, and they were able to confirm that she apparently works for a company rents out places on AirBNB (said person who was doing a story basically told me they weren't going to pursue this anymore due to time concerns). She isn't a grad student nor is she even a student. 

I don't feel like i won, and honestly i just feel absolutely infuriated with the entire situation. AirBNB to this day still has my place being listed on AirBNB. Who knows why she doesn't have keys anymore. 

My apartment is a disaster right now and from what my property manager has stated it seems like people definitely did smoke in my apartment. There are burns on my couch from cigarette, my dishwasher is broken, and pretty much everything needs a desperate deep clean. But my apartment is safe more or less. 

Anyways i wanted to thank everyone for your advice. It probably isn't the best ending but it taught me an extremely valuable lesson, and i can go home at Christmas and hopefully clean my apartment. ",legaladvice
[NE] HOA towed away my car and built a chainlink fence on my land,"So this is part 3 and most likely the final update for now.

Link to past: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7cirxu/continued_ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a/


So I was away for the holidays and I came back on Monday to find my project car was towed out of my driveway, my pond was emptied out and filled with gravel and sand and a fenced off 2 acres (2 chains by one furlong) of my property closest to HOA. I immediately called the police and filed a report regarding the stolen property. The car wasn't registered and was just an empty shell so I have no idea where it is nor will it be easy to track. It's not worth a lot (maybe $2,500?) but it's the principle of that jackass president of the HOA.


I had my lawyer draft up the C&D and sent it nearly 2 weeks ago and they haven't contacted me in any way except this. I hired a local salvage company to come tear up the fence this weekend and they are doing it free of charge since I'm letting them keep the fence to sell as scrap metal or whatever they do with it. 

My lawyer suggested I send up a letter demanding payment to fix my pond as it was filled in with gravel and sand. A local landscape company quoted me nearly $8,000 to get the pond back to the way it was so that is what he suggested I ask and another $2,000 for loss of use of the pond. The HOA has lawyered up so I think it's best I no longer post anything else on here until it's settled. I didn't want to leave you all without some closure since you all have been an amazing help. I've put a picture of the layout since a few people asked. It's bad but should convey the land.

I'm pregnant and I want to leave my husband [update],"Hi everyone,

I want to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice and words of encouragement. I read every single comment on both threads about my situation and I really really appreciate the support and help. If not for the advice here, I probably would not have felt justified in leaving.

I'm sorry for taking so long to post, but I am now back home in NH with my parents. I feel like I'm coming out of a fog and I feel really stupid for believing everything; I guess I just justified it by assuming laws were different in the south. 

I left with just my computer, my phone, my documents, and a few family heirlooms. I'm not concerned about my phone being tracked as I am still on my dad's phone plan. My husband has sent me about 200 texts and has filled my voicemail completely but I haven't spoken to him.

I managed to withdraw half the balance of two out of three joint accounts. The third is a local bank and I did not want to stay in the area any longer. My parents told me to just leave the money. They are going to help me get the medical procedures I need and then they are going to help me pay for a divorce attorney. I thought they would say I told you so because they told me not to get married, but they have been very supportive and even offered to pay for me to go back to college and finish my degree.

Massachusetts.,"I posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n6lrr/phd_student_here_being_accused_of_plagiarism_only/) about a plagiarism situation with the university in my PhD thesis.

To make it short, a few sentences in the thesis was too similar to what I had said in a couple of papers and my masters thesis. This wasn't a direct copy & paste, and  it was 7 sentences (53 words) out of my thesis which was a little over 95,000 words.

Last week I got an automated email that an investigation has been started on the recommendation of the person that I talked to. The email explained that in case scientific misconduct is found, I will have a chance to defend my case to the board and the board will decide what to do, which vary from a simple revision and resubmission to presenting the case to the diciplinary committee for a serious offense.

I asked for appointments with a few people. Head of the department, dean of students, and a head tutor to ask for advice. I haven't managed to see any of them yet.

Today, I received an email that the investigation is over and they have found no evidence of misconduct or plagiarism. They apologized for the stress that this has caused. A little later, I received another email from the head of the committee personally apologizing for this mess, and explaining that the officer who I talked to had gone fishing rather than doing the standard practice which is not the policy.

So that's that. Now I can graduate in peace. I cancelled the appointments and decided not to pursue the potential racism situation as there's no point anymore. Thanks all for advice. ",legaladvice
Being sued for helping a choking victim (OR),"I was eating at a diner with some friends at 3 am, the guy in the booth next to us started coughing and gagging. I realized he was choking and went to help him, I had Heimlich training at my place of work (I'm office safety manager for my floor). The guy managed to get the thing out and it flew across the booth. He looked really pissed, payed his bill and left. I felt like a little hero the rest of the dinner and then just kinda forgot about it. This was two weeks ago.
 
Today I got a letter from a law firm that I'm getting sued for battery, they said I bruised a rib, I have no clue how this guy figured out who I am. I thought I helped the guy seeing as he probably would have choked without help. How did he figure out who I am? I never actually spoke to him. Is this a real letter? Do I need a lawyer for this?
 

Edit: the language i used to describe him choking was wrong. He was choking, gagging sounds but otherwise silent and obviously distressing. ",legaladvice
"My college says if I miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes","(IA) I was sexually assaulted (while home over a break, not by another university student) and the trial of my attacker starts in two weeks. 

I am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and I'll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

I'd spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days I'd be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work I'd be missing. 

Unfortunately, one of the days I'll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

His request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if I missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

My professors were comfortable marking these as ""reported absences"" which basically means there was a justification like a doctor's note or other official documentation. 

I showed the deans that I was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn't  even really like I had a choice. I figured that would be enough documentation. 

The dean said that ""personal non-medical conflicts"" could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if I'd just  slept through class). They suggested I apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise I'd be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

This attack took enough from me already, I went to great lengths to be sure I didn't miss a day of school while recovering, I do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

I spoke to the title IX Office who'd promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence. 

I do not want to take a leave of absence. All my professors were ready and willing to work with me and I was/am entirely capable of keeping up with the work. 

Do I have any legal recourse here against the school? 

Thank you in advance. ",legaladvice

Boss constantly touches/chokes/body checks me. Others who report similar behavior to HR have been fired.,"NJ: I am an adult male and my boss (male, few years older) consistently touches me in front of dozens of other people in a professional office setting. He has put me in a headlock, he often grabs my shoulders or neck and shakes me, he tousles my hair, he often hipchecks me when I'm standing at someone else's desk. I've told him to stop but that makes it worse. Other people have complained to HR and been fired for this exact complaint, so I feel like I have no recourse there. 

On top of that he is a blatant racist and sexist, and says shit out loud in the office that I wouldn't even say to my friends at the bar. 

Should I get a hidden camera on my desk and present footage to him or to HR? or try the HR route myself? Should I just talk to him first and then get a camera? Not sure what the best path forward is. Interested to hear your thoughts. ",legaladvice

The venue/bar I was attending is actually on the city line between East Lansing and Lansing, so the officer directed me to the Lansing PD. 

The LPD officer told me that bar always calls about fake ID's and-- in his words-- ""90% of the time, they're wrong"" so he told me not to worry and he would get my identification back for me.

Found out wife was married before me and never divorced,"My wife and I are getting divorced after 19 years of marriage. She moved out 2 weeks ago and is living with her parents. The kids are with me. One of my daughters was at grandma's house this week visiting her mom and grandma mentioned to her this is her second marriage. My daughter mentioned it to me when she got home. I phoned my wife and she told me her high school boyfriend (he was 18, she was 16) took off to Mexico and got legally married. When they broke up a year later, they just broke up, never divorced. 
I have called my attorney to get some answers on this, his legal aide said he is out until Tuesday. It is killing me. I basically have 2 questions. Was I even married? We wed in the U.S., not Mexico and divorcing in the U.S. And two, we have a beach house in Cabo San Lucas. Is that now owned by 3 people (her first husband) and will that affect the sale when we try to sell?

My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised daughter. Update.,"[Wow, that last post got real popular it seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aqylaa/co_my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/), for better and for worse. Seeing as you guys got were interested in it I thought I would come back with an update. 

&#x200B;

Well, a lot has happened since that day. My daughter is safe with me and was let out of the hospital about a week ago. She is getting better every day. I know though, you guys want the full story so here it is

&#x200B;

After I made that post I took the advice given to me and the next time I saw my daughter I told her that it was wrong of me to ask her to keep secrets and that it's ok to tell her mom. Along with that I saw a lawyer recommended to me by a trusted party. When I went to see him he told me that this is ""A case lawyers salivate over"" and that my ex is in a lot of trouble. I immediately filed for emergency custody of my daughter. I also got into contact with the doctor again and explained the situation fully to him. He says that while he will not be getting lawyers involved that he wishes for me to submit the evidence to the police and file a report. Along with this, my lawyer has gotten into contact with the court that originally ordered us to vaccinate our daughter and has handed over everything I gave to him. He has advised me to stay quite on this matter so i'll leave it at my ex is in a lot of trouble with them. 

&#x200B;

During this time, my ex started to get suspicious. Maybe it was because a friend told her about a post on reddit and she freaked out? Who knows. A few days later when I saw her at the hospital we had an altercation. She became hysterical and yelled various threats and insults at me. Including telling me that I want to ""poison our daughter"" right in front of our sick child. She was escorted out of the building and the head nurse had banned her from coming back. After this she sent me a barrage of texts telling me that I am a monster and that if she had vaccinated her that she would be dead now. This was sent to my lawyer. As he puts it, ""she's what lawyers dream of when they hear who's on the other side of the court.""

&#x200B;

Outside of this, i've been advised to stay as quite as possible so i'll leave it with this. 

&#x200B;

This week I received emergency custody of my daughter until our custody hearing later this year. I have heard that the DA is slowly getting ready to move forward with a multitude of charges against my ex and that will land her in jail soonish.

&#x200B;

And that's really it for now. I'm going to follow the advice given by my lawyer and say nothing else to anyone. I do not want the media involved in this for a few reasons so i've left this as vague as possible. When this is all said and done, if the interest is still there I may come back again. But for now, thanks for the advice in the original thread, me and my daughter appreciate you all.

What happened to my brain damage settlement?,"When I was in 7th grade a man slammed into the side of the car I was in and effectively smushed open the top of my head. There was glass in my brain and small pieces were smashed off. My left foot was pushed to my head effectively snapping my shin. My heart ended up stopping for a while and I was revived. I went through brain surgery, PT, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

I hate to bring this up at all but I know I was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. Im grateful to be alive and I don't want to be a money grubber, but I feel that was rightfully mine or at least I have a right to know the details. My parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet I'm about to be 23 and whenever I bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

Again I really hate to do this but I'm not a money grubber. Ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. It's just I want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money I don't know came from. I'm not saying I'd ask for it back, for all I know it paid for my heavy medical bills...but I still have a right to know. How do I do that without help from my parents?

Edit: This happened in Missouri, STL.
(5/5) thanks for the legal advice and Ive been able to use case net to find my old case. Unfortunately it looks like it was dispositioned by both parties for an out of court settlement? But I do distinctly remember being awarded a settlement. Specifically when I was called into a corporate looking building to testify in front of alot of suits. I'll try and look into it by calling the courthouse and then lawyer. 

But im also surprised by the mass of hate mail in my inbox. Some even depicting me to be a future serial killer headcase. Despite my head injury I'm fully able to lead a perfectly normal UN-serial killer life. Thank you.",legaladvice
"[Update] I allowed my sister to move in with me, dad tried to say I kidnapped her to avoid child support (CT to NY)","Update of my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i\_allowed\_my\_17\_year\_old\_sister\_to\_move\_in\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/)

&#x200B;

TLDR: I didn't get in trouble for taking in my little sister and a court order for child support was issued.

&#x200B;

So, I had my day in court today for the child support hearing. Dad actually showed up for court instead of using the option of conference call like my mother did. My sister (let's call her Valerie) wanted to sit in the courtroom in case the judge had any questions for her in particular (he didn't, but I'm proud of how brave my sister is for going to court when she didn't have to) because I could feel my heart beating in my throat the entire time. 

The judge started out by saying he was unsure if a support order could be issued today given that Valerie is now 18 and in CT would be ineligible but in NY would be eligible until 21 but then began asking some some questions.

Dad did a lot of talking at first, mostly saying how he had a court order that gave him full custody of Valerie and that Mom was supposed to be paying him child support.  Then he said how Valerie dropped out of high school and left the state to live with me without telling him or getting his permission and how he didn't know for a month after the fact. he complained that Mom never speaks to him about anything, that I make no effort to have a relationship with him and that Valerie doesn't either. Boo-hoo, we're all ganging up on him and he doesn't know what he did to deserve it, etc.  Sure enough, as a few of you kind folks mentioned, the judge asked him ""Why didn't you know where she was for a month if she was supposed to be in your custody?"" 

He then says that she was staying with her mother at the time but that she would've had a place with him and still does have a place with him if she had asked. At that point, sick of hearing him play the victim, I piped up and asked as calmly as I could manage ""Why didn't she have a place with you 9 years ago when you dropped her off at Mom's house, didn't tell her you weren't coming back for her and then got rid of all her belongings?"" 

My mother on the phone confirmed what happened and said that she asked me if I could take in my sister because of my brother's violent behavior early in 2017. Valerie was 17 at the time she moved to NYS and is still attending high school to earn her diploma (better late than never) and I've been her sole source of support ever since. 

The judge then reviewed the guidelines for monetary support. My mother, being disabled and on social security, was to pay no more than $50 per month for support. Dad was to pay no more than 17% of his income, which translated to to roughly $800 per month. The judge asked me what amount I was looking for. My answer was that I just wanted some help with the groceries and her medical bills so I asked for a total of $250 from Dad and the max $50 from Mom. Dad tried to haggle me down to $200 per month because he just bought a house last year (you should've seen the look on the judge's face). The judge reminded him that the guidelines recommended $800 a month and I held firm on $250. Dad sighed and said he'll have to give up smoking to afford it (this is supposed to make me feel bad?). 

The judge made the order for support, effective until age 21 AND I never did get in trouble for allegedly ""kidnapping"" my little sister.

Thank you to everyone here that gave me encouragement to see this through and not fall for Dad's intimidation tactics.

"[CA] I want to divorce my wife of 6 years, who has been a Jehovah's Witness for the last 4 years because of the extreme teachings of the cult, and how it could affect our children (3,1).","So I started looking deeper into all of this amidst my wife and I's simultaneous suspicions that her mentors within her church were ""poisoning us.""  They would bring us food all the time over a couple month period, and we were constantly sick.  Since cutting those people out we have been better.  I want to the hospital to have us all screened, but they referred us to a social worker, who is talking with police on the matter.   

This is when I started looking deeper into this ""religion.""  Long story short, I want as far away as I can from this stuff as well as my children.  I'm a military veteran who is 29, and has supported my family entirely up until now.  I have only been out of the military for a a little over a year now, and have bad anxiety and ptsd issues that have made attaining a job hard, so I'm living off my GI bill through the military (monthly check to supplement education post military -36 months), and military disability.  My spouse is hesitant to work, because the people in her religion tell her a wife should be at home.  

I thought I was being a supportive husband by supporting her choice of religion, but now that I've learned more, I can't.  I've tried to talk calmly about this to her many times, but it goes nowhere.  The religion is designed to warn her about people like me, ""worldly"" people.   She goes on talking about ""the end"" all the time like she is anticipating it.  I hate to say it, but I fear the brainwashing has potentially dulled her sense of reality.   Even after knowing these people could have poisoned her own children, she defends the organization as a whole.  She doesn't want to go to any conventional counseling because ""other people don't need to know our problems.""  I have no idea what do to at this point.

I probably will be supporting our family by my previously mention means while I try to get mentally stable again to work full time over the next couple of years.  I only have about $15,000 in savings, and I own our only vehicle, a fully paid off car.  We have furniture and stuff but I'm not attached to any of it.  I have a life insurance policy that was converted from my military SGLI to a VGLI and that's it for assets.   Other than that, no big debts or anything.   

Over the last 4 years, this is kind of how the split has been raising the kids:

2016,17:  I was in the military, my wife would handle the morning routine with the kids because I left early in the morning and got home in the afternoon, and would play with the kids and help with everything like cleaning, brushing teeth, putting to bed etc.  The only thing I didn't do much was cook, which I only did maybe once a week.  



2018,2019 (post military):  I spent 2018 looking for and working several different jobs that didn't last long, mostly in part to stress and adjustment disorder, and as a result only worked about 5 months last year, which ate into savings. Besides that, we have done everything in terms of taking care and spending time with the kids kids equal.

As I right this, I hide my children's Easter eggs alone in the backyard, as my wife will stay in the bedroom today because of the ""holiday"" she is not allowed to celebrate.   The psychological effect of never having their mom around for birthdays and holidays is only going to get worse, and it's hard on me to have to see them do it alone. What kind of parent doesn't want to have fun with their children smh.   

What is a divorce going to look like with her? I really just don't want to give up my disability pay for life or my gi bill payments for school.  Furniture, car, belongings can be split idgaf.  I don't want to pay her long term.

The challenge was getting her into the consulate in Karachi but she actually got herself there (took weeks of planning) where they gave her travel documents to be able to come to the US. We bought tickets for her to go from Karachi to Doha and then to Boston where we picket her up from the airport. 

By the time her parents realized what's what she was on the Doha to Boston flight. Her parents tried to apply for a visa to come to the US but their visa applications were refused. I'm not aware if the people at the embassy who refused it actually knew about my cousin's supituation or not but we're glad they weren't able to come here.

We were sued via small claims court for half of the amount of the AC unit. The case predictably was dismissed as we didn't misrepresent the condition of the 14 year old unit.  

What was interesting is that he genuinely thought that we owed him the money. Almost to the point of self righteousness. The way he talked about us; what he supposedly was told with nothing evidentiary to back up his claims. Additionally stating that his lawyer said that his case was strong. His lawyer didn't manage to show up to court but still very strong case. Oh well. It's over.

I was filmed against my consent at a party. (UPDATE),"[Last Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5b1zon/i_was_filmed_against_my_consent_at_a_party/)

History: Myself with another girl did nude dancing at a private party with our best friends. In a private villa where expected things to be private. A pervert had followed us and traspassed and took a video from a window and posted it online. I asked if we have legal options against the person.

We went to the police. Myself, the other girl and the host of the party (owner of the property) to report it and see if the police will do something about it. They didn't. They said the uploaded video itself is not evidence for trasspassing and the nude/erotic nature of the video will not count as revenge porn, as there were people present at the party so we couldn't have an expectation of privacy.

It sucked. I didn't care about the video being out there as the chances of someone I know seeing it is probably less than getting hit by lightning (and even if they do it's not a big deal) but my friend was devastated because her family are very strict about these things.

BUT this didn't end there. This perv didn't stop. He tried to sneak into our other parties as well but we knew better now and we had security. They got him and handed him over to the police. So he was charged with trasspassing and they also found a camera on him with footage of women's bathrooms. They took his stuff and found out that he's been posting a lot of revenge, hacked and stolen porn and nudes online.

He's now locked up. Our video is also down and his accounts on porn sites are suspended.

It took many months and him fucking up again but we finally got him.

Coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if I don't have sex with him.,"So a guy I know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. I thought I had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but I guess he somehow found the video. We work in the finance industry and I do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. The guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

This is also because I went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

So, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, I'll just call myself H, he found revenge porn of me online. At first I was relieved that it was him cause I've known him for so many years and thought I could trust him. Then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. Horrified I push him away. He then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if I come over to his place and have sex with him. Other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

We're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. That day I just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

He's told me that I should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. Over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

I feel so betrayed, since I thought we were good friends. and I'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. I've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

He's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone I know if I don't have sex with him. 
Also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. I'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

(We didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

He seems to really like it there. Most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. He seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. He occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on Fridays, but not every Friday.

I'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. He never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. He's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""I don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. I thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when I dropped my kid off on Fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

We had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. Until today. We finish up dinner and I get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. I'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. It should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). Our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. Normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! But cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. Our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! Pretzels now!"". Not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). He did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". My husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" Our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. He did this several times. (Just typing this is making me nauseous again). My husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (We only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). My husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

My husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. We didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local PD dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

I've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but I have no idea what to do. Local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. I can't in good conscience send him back there again.

Are we overreacting? Do we just confront the director? How do we handle this? I obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.


Edit:

First, thanks to everyone for their supportive messages and comments and for taking the time to reply. We are truly blown away by your kindness and thoughtful words. We are also very grateful for all of the advice.

Second, an update. Our son didn't go to the school today and will not return in the future. We didn't contact the school and we don't plan to at all. We'll be out our deposit, but it's worth it at this point. I have another center that we will be touring next week, but we are also prepared for me to stay home with the kiddos for awhile.

This morning my husband called CPS and they said they only handle situations where the abuser is in the home. Next, he called the state licensing board and filed a complaint. The school has an otherwise squeaky clean record, but we were assured they would be opening up an investigation and interviewing every employee at the school. Finally, we called and then visited the local family advocacy center (basically relevant charities, social workers, law enforcement, etc under one roof). We met with a social worker and recounted the same points as above. When she was done taking notes, she called one of the onsite detectives who confirmed that without actual evidence (ie a verbal description of something from our son or physical evidence), there was nothing he could do. Without the cops getting involved, we will not be referred to a forensic psychologist or have the situation otherwise escalated.  As frustrating as that is, we are almost fortunate in a way that that type of evidence doesn't seem to exist (or that we stepped in before it did). As many of you said, both the detective and the social worker agreed that the cop that came by yesterday handled it very poorly, but that there was nothing they could do about that either. The social worker mentioned that our son seemed to be a happy kid, not the withdrawn or angry type she's seen in more serious situations. We were referred to a center that specializes in play based therapy that we will be following up with as well. If anything comes out during those sessions, the situation will be handed over to the authorities at that time. 

I think that covers everything that happened today. My husband had to go back to work so I've been at home on the couch cuddling my kiddos. If there are any developments, I'll update again, but that is it for now.

Thank you again for everything, Reddit. You truly came through in our time of need ❤️

I believe my HIPPA rights were violated when my surgeon's scheduler told my parents I was pregnant,"I never thought about the situation like this but I had people point out that my rights may have been violated and I'm not sure what steps to take next and I'll try to explain the situation the best I can.

I am 24 and live in the USA and I'm on birth control but it failed. I didn't realize I was pregnant until I went into the hospital for something unrelated and found out I needed surgery for something and that I was pregnant on the same day. I quickly looked into abortion options but haven't been able to go through with it because I haven't had the funding but I'm trying to figure that out now so I can get the surgery and be healthy again. 

I went for my surgical consultation and the doctor said he would feel much safer waiting for me to terminate before performing the surgery but I would have to schedule the surgery through his assistant A. A called me shortly after the surgical consultation and pressured me the entire phone call to keep the baby but when I told her I was planning on going through with the termination wouldn't schedule my appointment until I had gone through with it. So I've had to put the appointment off and wait until then, which is fine, but my parents are in on why I need the surgery and I've had to come up with excuses as to why I can't schedule it yet because I don't want them to try to pressure me to not terminate. 

Fast forward to last tuesday and I get a text from my dad that says something to the effect of 'we know why you haven't scheduled the appointment and we're very disappointed in you.' It turns out that they called the office and the assistant disclosed my pregnancy to my parents and it's causing me a great deal of emotional turmoil because my parents have been acting super weird around me and now I'm doubly stressed about the situation. I never gave her or anyone else to disclose my medical status to anyone and I feel like my rights as a patient have been violated.
 
I guess my questions would be: Do I have grounds for legal recourse, what would my next steps be and what should I do from here.

Edit: fixed a word bc I don't proofread

"[Update] Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

Just wanted to thank you all for your support/advice, i was really dumb and naivee when it comes to renting out my apartment. The last time i rented it out the tenant left on time, and i never actually thought about what could happen if they didn't leave.

I have started the process of evicting the tenant today, with support from a local lawyer who is going to handle a bunch of the paperwork for me, and represent me.

My condo board thankfully has been super understanding as soon as i outlined that it was being done without my knowledge, and they have agreed to wave the penalties. Apparently there were noise complaints on Friday relating to my apartment which annoyed our condo board. Our concierge service (we have someone at the front desk 24/7), will no longer be allowing people to leave keys for people at the front desk.

On Sunday two people came in to the building asking for keys to my unit, and our concierge  service asked if they were AirBnB tenants, and they said yes. He then basically told them to leave right away, and they aren't welcome here.

Jane finally got in touch with me today, and basically accused me of numerous things, from harassing her renters, to just in general making her life difficult. She also stated that she will be going to the LTB to ""make a formal complaint because banning AirBnB is not allowed"". When i pointed out that as people have told me here that she needs to get  my permission before renting out to other people. She went a rant about how she is doing this for numerous places and how she has never had a problem and ""how stupid i am for making her my enemy"".

I have a ton of proof of what she is doing, honestly my biggest concern is what is going to happen to my apartment. I asked a friend to book my room for one night through AirBnB for tomorrow (as it just apparently became available for rent), and take a look at the state of my apartment.",legaladvice

"[IN] 4 days ago I accidentally almost got into the wrong car, causing the elderly woman inside the car to try to flee and she fell. Today I was told I'd be sued if I didn't pay ambulance & ER bills.","
Four days ago (Monday 11/4) I was parked in a very full parking lot and returned to my car in a distracted state. I didn't realize that I was parked next to a car that was identical to mine. I opened the unlocked driver's side door and put my leg in, but immediately withdrew my leg because I heard someone inhale sharply and then heard the passenger side door open. Obviously this wasn't my car so I began apologizing and, as I was shutting the door, I could see an elderly woman struggling to get out of the car.

I was still apologizing when she fell out of the car. I went around quickly and asked if she was alright, did she need me to call an ambulance, did she need me to go find whoever she was waiting for, etc. She told me I didn't need to call an ambulance, but asked if I would stay with her until her daughter came back. She didn't know which store her daughter was in and didn't have her number memorized. I helped her back into the passenger seat. 

She had an abrasion on her right palm, which I offered to disinfect since I keep a first aid kit in my car. She accepted and said she wasn't hurt anywhere else, just shaken up. She asked me for water and I gave her a bottle from my car. She told me she was diabetic and that her blood sugar was low and she didn't have her insulin with her, so I offered her a banana. We spent about 5 or so minutes together before her daughter came running up.

We explained to her what happened and the daughter was pissed at me, rightfully so since I did scare her mother and she fell. I offered again to call an ambulance to make sure she was alright and they both refused. I suggested they take her to her doctor as soon as possible to make sure she didn't injure anything from the fall. I apologized again and went home. 

This morning the daughter and her husband showed up on my front porch. I think they were trying to intimidate me since the husband stood there the entire time with his arms crossed and with what I assume was supposed to be a scary look on his face. 
The elderly woman and I only exchanged first names so I don't know how they found out who I am or where I lived. I asked and they said they ""had their ways."" The daughter told me she ended up calling an ambulance because her mother began to have a panic attack before they left the parking lot. I asked if she was okay and she told me that wasn't any of my business. She said that they were going to sue me if I didn't pay the ER bill and the ambulance bill. They said they wanted $3,500. I asked if her mother had insurance and was again told it wasn't my business. I asked to see the bills because I obviously have my doubts and they said they didn't have them with them. I said ""So you expect me to just hand you $3,500?"" and that pissed them both off. I told them to get off of my property and that I'd call the police if they refused or came back. I told them to have their lawyer contact me. They both called me a bitch and left. 

I've included every detail I can think of, so my question is could they really sue me? I understand you can basically sue anyone for anything, but am I legally responsible to pay these medical bills if they do in fact exist? 

Thanks in advance. I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting errors. 

Edit: Thank you to those who responded. I'm 31, but often get mistaken for someone much younger. The daughter and her husband are, or look to be, in their mid to late forties. I suspect they may just have seen what they think to be a young and naive woman that may be dumb/scared enough to pay them.

I do have a home security system. I can also defend myself should my home security system fail. Thank you to those voicing concern for my safety.

(OK) Mom passed away and things aren't adding up.,"[Update]

The last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.  I kinda feel like I'm living in one of those crime novels. At one point, I seriously considered walking away from it all because there were enough things that took place to make me feel like it was a possibility I might find myself having some kind of ""accident"" in the near future. 

I obviously won't be able to share too many details...at least not yet...but I do want to let everyone know I have an attorney, as well as a private investigator who is a retired FBI agent with a LOT of connections. As of today, I have finally been able to locate my mother's body and it has not been cremated. I also have been granted access to her property.  A lot of things are missing.  The vehicle has been reported as stolen as well as a few other items... which I'm sure the list will grow as we continue to go through her belongings. 

Thank you to every single one of you who offered your help, resources, experiences, and condolences. I will never be able to express the amount of gratitude I have for your willingness to help a stranger you've never met. You guys are amazing!!

To those of you that called me a karma farmer and questioned the validity of my personal hell...I hope you step on legos barefooted and catch your pinky toe on the coffee table. When you do, think of me.




I'm not really sure what to make of all this and I could really use some insight on the matter. Evidently my mom passed away last Wednesday June 5th...I say evidently because my brother and I weren't notified until yesterday evening of her passing. 

I'm not entirely clear on the details because the circumstances are not adding up and I'm afraid if I try and explain the chain of events... it'll become extremely confusing but I feel like the manner in which this was handled seems fishy.  

We first learned of the news from a friend of our mother's who says she recieved a phone call yesterday (4 days after my mother's passing) from someone claiming to be a sheriff of the county my mother resided in, informing her my mother had passed away and asked if she happened to have keys to my mother's house because they were trying to locate next of kin. (See...weird huh?) He claims he found her number by going through my mother's phone (which would've been with her in her house, where they found her so why do they need keys) She told them she did not have keys but they could try calling her children (me and my brother) or her brother (my uncle) and that our numbers should also be in the same phone. 

My mother's friend calls me to ask what was going on and did something happen to my mom and while I'm talking to her, my uncle calls me... which is odd because I haven't spoken to him in over 10 years and I wasn't even aware he had my number. He immediately goes into this whole story about how my mom passed away last Wednesday of a massive heart attack in her home and the police from her town contacted him after they were sent to her house to do a welfare check and found her. They supposedly went through her phone and saw he was the last person she talked to so they contacted him first. Then without skipping a beat or even giving me a chance to process all of this,  he goes on to tell me that my mother had informed him on multiple occasions that she was leaving everything to him and that he was to make sure my brother and I, were to receive none her belongings and he kept mentioning his good friend Sheriff Whats-his-nuts ( fake name for obvious reasons) and HIS attorney have both informed him he was not to contact my brother or me about the situation and that since my mother left him everything, he needed to remove what he wanted from her home and donate the rest to Salvation Army. He was making arrangements to have her cremated and would let me know if he decides to do a funeral... then he hung up.

How is that even possible? Can he do that? I mean even if by some crazy off the wall chance my mother lost her mind and created a legal living will that named her brother... who's almost 15 years older than my mother by the way... the executor of her will and she left everything she owns to him...is there not some kind of reading of the will my brother and I are required to attend? Is this how this stuff goes down? I really can't be involved in making funeral arrangements for my own mother? Never once had our mother ever mentioned she had a will and I can not fathom her leaving everything to my uncle. But my feelings aside what is the legal process here? How could I find out for certain if there even is a will? 

The situation gets a little crazier because after I called my brother, he calls my uncle and is told the same thing... they argue a little over the phone and it's now turned into my brother and I are allowed to accompany my uncle to my mother's house, and ""rummage through what's left to see if there's anything we want"" but it has to be this coming Wednesday because he has meetings all day Tuesday (today) with a probate attorney to iron out the details of my mother's estate. To my knowledge he's already taken her dog and her brand new car, into his possession. 

This makes me think there is no will. If there was a will like he originally claimed, and my brother and I were to receive nothing... how are we all of the sudden allowed to look through what's left?

I'm extremely uncomfortable with this situation. 

The most disturbing part of this whole ordeal is, I know my mother was working on the legal details of an invention she recently had patented and was in the process of interviewing manufacturers to fabricate her invention.  She reviewed all the legal paperwork with my brother and me a few months ago...I'm worried that's why my uncle is in such a hurry to hire a probate attorney, and throw names of law enforcement friends of his (he himself is a retired police officer) which would also explain why it took him 4 days to notify my brother and me about her passing. 

Isn't there some kind of chain of command that has to be followed when it comes to notifying next of kin? Is there a certain legal process that needs to happen when a person has a will?? Or even if they don't?? Sorry for the long post. I'm still trying to understand all of this. It just doesn't seem to make any sense. Who should I contact first? The police in her area? An attorney? What do I do?

Update: I can't respond to anyone now that its been locked but to answer a few questions. No I haven't seen the body though my own eyes and neither has my brother. He and I are getting together today to get a lawyer. This is in fact very real and I'm not making it up at all. I created a new account in hopes of not being recognized as this is turning into a very tricky situation. My brother and I are both very overwhelmed at the moment and we're in a bit if a situation where we aren't exactly sure who we can trust.  As far as my  motive behind mentioning my mother's invention...evidently that was precieved as making this entire thing seem like a made up story. All I can tell you is, sorry I didn't disclose that in a manner which made it more believable for you. I guess I'm poorly communicating the events i've been through recently and to be honest, I'm trying more so to get actual advice, not to make sure you believe me.",legaladvice

(Texas) Power of attorney seems fishy?,"So, I'm 29 and my parents don't allow me to get a job or move out on my own and every time I try to, they threaten me with this. I do have mental disabilities, however I am fully functional and I also have never been diagnosed. This leads me to questioning the veracity of my parent's threats. I do remember my parents dragging me into an SSA office when I was younger and they made me sign some document without me reading it. They just told me to sign it without question and being my parents I didn't think to question them. Later they told me that I had signed away my rights (their phrasing) and that they now have power over me. Every time I try to run away they also threaten to call the cops and they tell me that since I'm disabled and I have no guardianship over myself, whoever I go to can be charged with kidnapping since my parents didn't consent. I'm also not allowed to have friends or anything because they use this to dictate my every move. They tell me I'm crazy and helpless and I can't be trusted and that's why for my own good they got this thing.

&#x200B;

Other things that might be important that make my question things:

They don't care about my well being. They don't allow me to go to therapy even when I've asked. They refuse to allow me to see a doctor and when I finally did, they threw away my medication because they claim it was bad for me. I know for sure I do have a mental disability, I just don't know what and once again, they've never took me to get diagnosed let alone therapy. They've always been controlling and I wonder if this is just another method. I get too scared to call Suicide Hotline when I'm depressed because they had me convinced for the longest time that, quote, ""they'll lock you up in a mental asylum for life and take away your phone and never let you talk to the people you love ever again and they'll treat you like you're crazy."" I've since learned this is obviously not true, but it's ingrained in me now and I have a hard time seeking help. I feel that this is also yet another form of control.

&#x200B;

Anyways, how do I go about verifying if they really do have this thing over me? What are their rights if this is true? What are my rights? Can I, I guess appeal (not sure if this is the right word)? What can I do about this?

&#x200B;

Is there any other legal advice y'all can offer that I haven't thought about asking for? Can I do anything about how controlling my parents are, legally speaking? Can they really deny me therapy and medical care?

&#x200B;

I should also I add they sabotage any jobs I try to work because of the POA thing. I currently help my mother around the store they own and they pay me randomly and I'm not on any official payroll that I know of. Is this also legal????

Employer lured me with an offer letter that has terms that are impossible to meet.,"I graduated from pharmacy school in June of 2018 and I was hired by a pharmacy chain to work in California. I went to school in a nearby state and had to move for this job. 

My offer letter says that I have 90 days from graduation to get licensed. It is NOT possible to get a pharmacist license within 90 days of graduation in California. The process takes about 4 months. I was verbally told by my district manager that the letter is the same in every state and that they don't enforce that 90 day rule.

I moved, passed all the tests, and got licensed in October. I was put on the schedule for only 16 hours each week. The schedule is for several weeks ahead. I brought it to the attention of our scheduler and the district leader. I was told that I MIGHT get more hours at some point if I learn to work more efficiently.

I pointed out that my offer letter says full time work. He says the term isn't legally defined and it can be whatever the company defines as full time. He also said that the offer letter was void because I didn't get licensed within 90 days. He said that if I work with more urgency and get my speed-based metrics up, then everything will be just fine for me.

Is he correct about all this? I went on the company website and they define full time as 30+ hours in order to get health benefits.

 I don't know a lot about the law, but it feels like it would be illegal to lure people with an offer letter that they know has requirements that are impossible. The board of pharmacy has lots of documents available online which show that a 90 day requirement is impossible to meet.

"[Alabama] Tailgated by police for 3 minutes, then searched and ticketed for going 56 in 55","  

I'm driving down a country road with a posted 55 speed limit. Cop car gets in behind me. Bad experiences with cops so I do everything by the books, change to the right lane and use autopilot to maintain the exact speed limit, letting the cop pass.

Cop changes to my lane and starts tailgating instead of passing. I maintain speed limit. After several minutes, the lights and sirens go on and I get pulled over. They search my car and repeatedly make me do several sobriety tests. I ask to blow into a breathalyzer to prove that I don't drink or do drugs but they didn't have one and kept making me do sobriety tests for around 10-20 minutes while searching my car.

They didn't find anything after wasting my time for half an hour, then gave me a traffic ticket for going 56 mph on a 55 mph road.

Not sure if this is legally relevant, but I'm a black male in my 20s with no criminal or traffic violation record. I also had an LSU sticker on the back of my car.

Is there anything I can do regarding this, or do I just chalk it up as part of the Alabama experience and just fly next time I need to pass through the state? I have a frontal dash cam which did not catch the tailgating behavior but can prove my speed.",legaladvice
"[MI, USA] Considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now I have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear","I have a big family, with around 20 cousins,  10 aunts and uncles, and several others who always show up to family  reunions. I'm a male in my 20s.

Last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. On the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. This air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. This campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

As soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. He showed no remorse whatsoever. He laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

I was so furious when it happened that I didn't know what to do. I sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. I wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while I emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. But instead I  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. It's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. It's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

He clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. While everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""I heard your ears were ringing. Sorry about that."" He didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. I grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but I absolutely do not forgive him.

This happened last Saturday, a week ago. For the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. Since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. It's the worst when I'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. I hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. Sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. I think I could have permanent hearing damage.

This  guy has been giving me shit since I was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. I've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but I figured some people here might have good info as well. I won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. Any info is appreciated. Suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but I really don't care about that if I end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life. It's interfering with my ability to sleep and work. Thanks for any help.

Employer gave us all $0 paychecks because they haven't been doing our taxes right,"Colorado

Worlds fastest update - refused DNA test (CA),"While I was getting my ass handed to me in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. From what I hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, I don't think they actually took anyone's dna.


Many people pointed out that I sounded sketchy in my original post. That was probably true. I'm a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and I did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. I didn't know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so I thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things I never got caught for would come up. If I knew I was just being tested against a baby, I would have said sure.


I want to say that *because* of my past, I'm a squeaky clean employee- I never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an Advil from the med cart. We're not supposed to ever be alone with members, and I never am, even if I'm just dropping off a tray in someone's room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen. I guess I was acting paranoid because I was pissed about being suspected when I've tried so hard to be straight, and that ended up making me seem more suspicious. 


Hopefully now that the guy who did it was arrested, things can go back to normal. I hope the woman who was raped is doing okay (she's not here anymore, and I don't know what is happening). Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to let everyone know what was going on. 


**Edit:** I think the reason everyone was so mad at me in the original post was because I was acting like *I* was the victim, even though obviously that was not the case. That is some of that addict mentality, that I'm still working on with my sponsor.",legaladvice
A 15 year old girl made false allegations to CPS about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter.,"My daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. I don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know I was talking about them. 

The girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... She just has delusions of grandeur). The mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

I will refer to the mother as Lorrie and the daughter as Katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

Lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying Katy. The assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss Katy. I'm not sure if Lorrie had anything to do with the CPS report but I can not contact her directly. Lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. I tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

Katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. My daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that Katy said and I advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. When the friendship fell apart, Katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. My daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

One of the things Katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and I remembered it pretty vividly. My daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

A few days ago, CPS knocked on our door while I was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what Katy was saying about him at school a few months ago. There is no one else who could have made this complaint. It was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. My husband said the CPS employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. I wasn't there so I don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

The problem is I have no proof. The assistant principal at my daughter and Katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around Katy when she made these comments about my son so I might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

What should I do? Is there anything I can do? Do I even have a leg to stand on? All I have is my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids. 

Any advice is welcome. I'm terrified.

I am in VA.

Edit: I'm not looking to sue anyone or anything. I just want to clear all of this up and I want Katy to be held accountable for making a false report. The things she reported could potentially hurt my son's reputation and damage his future. The allegations were not about me or my husband being neglectful or abusive. They were accusing my son of doing horrible things that he did not and would never do.",legaladvice

I (23F) genuinely think that there's someone living in my attic.,"I'm not sure this is the right place to post but it made the most sense to me. I have reasonable suspicion that someone is squatting in my attic or accessing it on a regular basis. 

To note. The house hadn't been lived in for about 4 months prior. And is in an OKAY area of Cleveland, OH. 

I've been moved in for about a month and a half - I've heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then I've just chucked it up to being new house sounds. I'll be honest and say I've been too scared to see if anything's up there since I've moved in so I've never even seen the attic. Today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so I asked him to check it out. He popped up with a flashlight and there's a tent set up. He came down and told me. My sister and I came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. The back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. We called the cops and waited about ten minutes. Once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. Cops didn't do anything and didn't even go up to check. They were neato. So I put my head up to check while they were there. It's a tent. There's playing cards. They took my name and left. 

Sooo I nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. I was thinking first thing I should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

Other than that - Do I hire someone to check the house? Do I call the cops again another day?  
Should I not stay here alone?

UPDATE: My other sisters boyfriend came over today and the two of them went up there and scooped it out. It looks like a weird grow op. Can't can't if anyone was there. To me it doesn't look like it. But it's strange regardless

Guy tried to pass me and hit oncoming traffic. Said he'd sue me since I didn't slow down (GA),"EDIT: Finally know everything that has occurred legally. My stepdad has some friends and found out what was reported. After the officer told me I could leave, the drivers of both cars were taken to the hospital and the officer eventually met up with the guy overtaking me once he was stable. Guy told him I sped up and that I was ""mad he was passing me."" Said Officer went back and looked up my license number (whoever said they normally get numbers for everyone was right. I didn't even think he actually got it) and saw that I already had a speeding citation (from a year ago) and considered it reasonable enough to give me the leaving scene of an accident citation. So. The officer stated his reasoning was the discovery of new evidence i.e. my old ticket. 

My parents are furious and we're just waiting for my day in court because there's no evidence I sped up, there's no dash cam footage that's mysteriously came up, there's nothing besides the guy making an illegal pass saying it was my fault. 



Hello! 17 year old here with okay driving history (I have a speeding ticket but I did my time for it). I was on the way to school a few weeks ago and was driving pretty much at the speed limit because it's been rainy for a few weeks and I'm also just still paranoid since my first ticket. Two lane road, solid yellow lines. 

Cue a-hole tailing me and eventually crossing over to pass. I guess he didn't look good enough because he ended up going headfirst into a car in the opposite lane. I swerved out into the grass and my car was fine but the other two were pretty messed up. The first police on scene did ticket him for crossing the solid yellow but the driver was pretty much unconscious anyway. 

I moved on from it since I didn't cause the accident and I went on to school. Yesterday, my stepdad got some papers (my car is registered in his name) from the juvenile court for my county saying I was being faulted for an accident and that this guy's insurance was coming after me. I was so confused because my car wasn't damaged, I don't need this on my driving record, and so on. My stepdad went through the papers and it seems like the original driver is trying to say it was my fault he hit someone because I was supposed to slow down when I saw him passing. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do here. Is this a situation where I can tell him to pound sand or should I take it seriously? 

Edit: My stepdad called juvie court today and asked what I was charged with and he was told that the officer on scene I spoke to (I told him exactly what happened - guy passed me and hit someone. He asked to see my license. I didn't see why not. He basically said ""Thanks for reporting I'll contact you if I need anything else have a good day"") is citing me for leaving the scene of an accident. And the reason he let me go then was because he ""didn't know I could've prevented the accident until further investigation.""

We're even more confused and my parents went to the insurance people today and they said no one has contacted them but they made copies of all the paperwork and that we'd all just have to wait. I'm guessing other driver got my license plate number and told him I sped up or something. I don't know what to do here because if this sticks, I lose my license until I turn 21 (stipulation of my first ticket). ",legaladvice

"[Norway] My classmate ordered custom sweaters for our class. The sweaters never came, and she got the money back over a year ago. Me and my other classmates never got our money back from her, she has it all. How do I get her to give my/our money back?","Over three years ago (January 2014) we ordered custom sweaters for our class. My classmate, let's call her Frida, received money from us and then placed the order. We were around 65 people ordering, and it costed around $25 per sweater, so she got around $1625

Long story short, the distributor scammed us and we didn't get the sweaters. Frida was clearly annoyed with us asking about updates, and stopped replying completely to anything related to it. In August 2017 she announced that she had gotten all the money back a while ago, and that we could send her our account numbers and she'd send out the money ASAP. Everyone were relieved and happy. After a few weeks, no one had gotten their money back from her and asked what was going on. One person said she got her money (Frida's best friend), but none of the others as i know of. Now it's over a year ago and no one's heard anything still, she hasn't posted or replied after she made the original post saying she got the money.

I sent her a PM the other day asking for an update. I said it's fine if she needs more time to do it for whatever reason, that i'm sure everyone's understanding, but that people just want a reply. That the silence is the frustrating part. She has completely ignored it.

What can I do to get my/our money back? I thought about telling her I'll report her for fraud if she doesn't reply or give my money back within two weeks. The report will most likely not result in anything, but maybe it'd push her to repay everyone?

&#x200B;

**Edit since I cant reply to people**: Thank you all for your advice, it's been really helpful. And you're right, the distributor didn't technically scam us since he did repay us after two years (or earlier if Frida had them a while). I do know there was an attempt to get the sweaters since she wasn't the only one working on getting our money back and talking to the distributor, and also because we got pictures of the sweaters at one point.

I'm not going to talk to the folk high school since the nature of the school is that you take one year there basically studying a hobby you have. Norwegians often call it a free-year to relax before going to uni, and figuring out what you want to do with your life. Since we left that school three years ago I don't think they'd appreciate getting involved. If it was a uni or highschool i would, though.

We are all spread across the country now, but I'll message everyone involved and ask them if they want to take legal action against her, at the same time as I message Frida letting her know that if she keeps ignoring us it'll have consequences. Hopefully she'll be scared into just repaying us, and if not then I'll follow your legal advice on what to do next. I won't let it go even if she gives me my money back but no one else.

I'm also gonna pop her then-boyfriend a message and ask him what he knows, as he's one of my best friends and might have some intel. ",legaladvice
(Update) The exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order,"You all thought it over.  So did I.  But no!  Turns out this story really could get weirder

Recap- years ago I took in an injured stray cat.  The cat was did not have a collar or chip.  A good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. After owning the cat for several years I began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  They demanded I return the cat and I refused and blocked them.  Eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  The letters demanded I pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  At this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

Someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. I ignored the first two but when they kept arriving I went ahead and did so.  I assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter I received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  This was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

So, to cut this already way too long story short, I filed a police report.  After some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  Okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

I will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but I'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  This is honestly the single dumbest thing I've ever gone through.

My cat continues not to care.

"Dog died while under sitter's care - story does not add up (Los Angeles, CA, USA)","My fiancé and I were out of town for vacation and left our two dogs with a sitter who runs her daycare out of her home (Los Angeles, CA). We dropped the dogs off on Tuesday. The sitter informed us she was going out of town on Wednesday but had an alternate sitter lined up who would be staying in her house to cover things from Wednesday until her return on Saturday. She also tells me about the vet tech who lives in the front of her duplex who she sometimes uses for ""emergencies"". 

Today (Saturday) I get a frantic voicemail from the sitter stating that my dog had a seizure and wasn't going to make it. I call the vet and they confirm that he was brought in this morning experiencing convulsions, went into cardiac arrest and they could not resuscitate him. He was a perfectly healthy 5/yo dog with no issues whatsoever when I left him. 

I drive home, frantic, and arrive at the vet to say goodbye to my dog, and am told by the vet tech about the ""bite marks"" he was treated for elsewhere and was brought in with - which I immediately explain I know nothing about. They bring out my dog's body, which has a huge bite mark with approximately two dozen stitches on his spine right at the neck/hackles level. I immediately begin calling the original sitter and alternate sitter to find out wtf is going on. 

Original sitter finally caves and explains that he was ""attacked at the dog park"" by a ""pit-type dog"" and she did not get the other dog owners info. Says that she didn't tell me because she ""didn't want to ruin my vacation and it was no big deal"". I ask the alternate sitter if the original sitter told her to lie to me and her answer was a ""No....Yes... Kind of"" and then she proceeds to tell me that original sitter didn't want to ""ruin my trip"" and so asked she and her boyfriend not to tell me, and they felt conflicted but ultimately followed her wishes. 

I wait for original sitter to get back to town. While outside I confront the vet tech who lives in the front of the duplex asking if he knew anything of what happened to my dog, which he denied. While waiting for original sitter to show up fiancé overhears the vet tech make a phone call saying ""[original sitter] told people we've been working together and I don't normally do this kind of stuff but I could lose my job"" - moments later a woman pulls up to his house, enters, carries out a pink duvet from his home, and puts it in her trunk and drives away. 

Original sitter gets home and when questioned about a vet receipt for the stitches, gives me a photo taken of a printed receipt that shows services were rendered for the 29th - a day after she was already out of town - and that the credit card charge was entered manually. She cannot provide a physical copy of the receipt and the medications she says they provided my dog (I have the bottles) do not match the medications on the photo of the receipt she gave me. 

She tries to say it must have been a ""brain disease"" and that the dog bite had nothing to do with it... But the vet I spoke with who treated my dog for the seizures said that A) a healthy five year old dog should have survived a seizure so likely it was a bacterial infection that caused it, potentially from the bite; B) my dog should have been held for 24 hour observation after the bite/anesthesia/stitches

It seems to my like the original sitter's story is not adding up and I'm wondering if she didn't have her vet tech friend perform some sort of illegal, back yard surgery to stitch up my dog and then have someone forge the receipt. What can I legally do here to get to the bottom of this situation, and what sort of case do I have against her? I don't even care about the money because it won't bring my dog back, but I want to make sure she is never allowed to do this to someone else.",legaladvice
"Ended up in the ER after an accident at work, my boss is lying to me to me and playing stupid. Turns out she does not have WC and may not even have a business license.","I work a landscaping design job in Florida. We're paid with a handwritten check and under-the-table. I got a long splinter under my fingernail all the way to the end of the nail bed while pulling weeds on the job. It was only my 5th shift (although second week) working there. I ended up having to go to the ER to get it surgically removed, lots of fun getting multiple shots in my finger. 

I'm given a ""workers compensation verification form"" to bring to my employer. I was supposed to work the next morning, so I went ahead and contacted her, telling her I'd bring the form. She starts telling me that I never signed a W9 so I'm not actually an employee and she's not actually liable. I've already been paid by her once. She goes on to say I never told her and that I'm just making accusations, even though I had told her about it the morning after it occurred, and she had acknowledged it multiple times throughout the day.

After searching a few state databases, the only business license she has under her name is one for real estate, and no record of workers comp coverage. Looking back on it, I think the hospital staff discovered this as well but were going to let me figure that out.

"[IA] My father left my 3y/o daughter about $500k in a trust, ex-husband (who lives in MN) wants to use the trust funds for living expenses","My father left my daughter, who is 3, about $500k in a trust. The trustee is not a family member, but a professional trustee. My daughter is supposed to begin receiving the money at 25, but they explained that they have the power to dispense money early for the right circumstances, like a private school or medical bills - or, as they very loosely and briefly mentioned, basic living costs in an emergency hardship situation. They gave an example that if I were to become ill and unable to work, the trust could provide some level of assistance to ensure my daughter does has food on her plate and a roof over her head. However this was glossed over pretty quickly and I don't know the technical details.

About two months ago my ex husband quit his job because he said they are unwilling to be flexible with him for his debilitating migraines (his employer told me that he claims to have migraines but has never actually seen a doctor about them for treatment), and says he has been unable to find a new job and intends to instead pursue getting on disability, but expects that to take 2-3 years. He says that he will soon lose his apartment. He is unable to receive most government-based assistance because he scammed the system last year (lied about income to receive food assistance for which he was not qualified and got caught).

So, he has now approached the trustee and wants to use the trust money to pay for an apartment, utilities and a car until he is approved for disability. I was especially surprised about the car portion - he says he needs money to purchase a safer vehicle because his vehicle is old, rated poorly for crashes and does not have working seatbelts (which is a surprise to me - just a few weeks ago I buckled her into the back seat when he picked her up, so not sure what exactly he is claiming there).

I disagree with this use of the funds, particularly because he only has her for 6 days per month. I understood the ability to use the trust for living expenses should be limited to scenarios in which she is genuinely in danger of being homeless or neglected, and that is not the case as I provide everything she needs now and can do so all the time if he is unable to. My father intended the money to provide her with opportunities once she is old enough to use it wisely, not to facilitate my husband's visitation in our custody agreement.

Since my ex husband has a history of committing fraud when receiving government assistance and also a history of faking illness (he lied to a previous employer to receive paid time off work claiming he was being treated for cancer when he was not), I do not trust that his intentions here are genuine. I suspect he sees the trust as a way that he can get free money so that he doesn't have to get another job.

Anyhow, my question: since the trust is for the benefit of my daughter and she is obviously a minor, what can I do to ensure it is protected? Should I assume that the trustee has her interests in mind and will not prematurely release money for something like this, or does it sound like there is real danger that he will drain the trust? Is it possible for me to hire a lawyer to argue that the money should be saved for her later in life unless the circumstances are truly dire? I'm not sure if I can actually hire a lawyer and get them involved because I am not the trustee, the company is.

"My neighbor wants me to sell my house to his friend at much less than market value. He has threatened to ""scare away"" anyone else I show the house to.","I'm moving soon and need to sell my house. When my neighbor found out about this he had one of his friends take a look at it and he made me an offer far below what I would expect to get.

After I turned it down he became agitated. Since then he's been making thinly veiled threats about how he'll approach anyone else who sees the house and ""tell them ALL about the house in the interest of full disclosure"". He stressed the word ""all"" which leads me to believe he'll make up some pretty grandiose stories.

[UPDATE] Someone I've never met claims they own my house," Hi everyone –
 
I can't thank you enough for all your advice on my last post: ""Someone I've never met claims they own my house"".  This is the first update, and I'm hopeful there will just be one more after this, wrapping everything up so we can put this behind us.  This is what has happened since my last post:
 

After the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they'd been alerted to the Lis Pendens and could also represent us.  We were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  They said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. We hung up.
 

We looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner's title insurance (yay!).  Our deed is a ""Bargain and Sale"" deed, for those wondering. We also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  The last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  I signed up on ACRIS to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  I also emailed the DA for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  I gave it to him, but he hasn't called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
My husband met with our lawyer this morning, and I asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. Prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the Lis Pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  According to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  Our lawyer called their law firm and basically said ""Where is the deed?""  They supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we're starting to think they don't have it, and never did!  They may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who's like ""Yeah, I totally own that place.  I even have a deed for it.  No, you can't see it.""  It's possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

In addition, it's not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn't been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 YEARS AGO and there is STILL no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (I was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  Our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them ""You have no grounds for this.  Take it off.""
 

The attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on Friday.  I am hopeful that it will just be a matter of ""Take the Lis Pendens off."" And ""Ok"".  I'll update again after the call between the lawyers. I told my husband the number 1 question is ""Where. Is. The. Deed?""  When we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason I was freaking out. I honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  If they give us a hard time about removing the Lis Pendens, then we'll see.
 

So far my takeaway from this that I would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  And just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that's like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but I'm not bitter……).
 

Thank you all so much for your help,  I'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude.",legaladvice
UPDATE: Neighbors kid fell of trampoline into our yard (NY),"original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wyn3f/ny\_neighbors\_kid\_fell\_off\_their\_trampoline\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wyn3f/ny_neighbors_kid_fell_off_their_trampoline_into/)

Thank you to everyone who shared their advice.  I contacted my HOI and the representative laughed at the fact that we were getting sued.  Long story short she said not to worry and they would handle it.  I contacted a few lawyers in my family and they said the neighbors have no bounds to sue since trampolines are apparently illegal in my town.

Turns out the neighbors do not own the house and that they rent it, the owner and landlord of that house was miffed since he is the one that will have to pay the fines for the trampoline.  Turns out that the renters don't have renters insurance (which is why they asked for a cash payment from me). Last I heard was that the landlord gave them a 30 day notice.  As for me?

"My truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction.

I immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

Fast forward to last Friday, I receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... On November 1! Six weeks prior! From my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

I called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. A later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which I would think is illegal. Apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but I had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. I had no idea it had even been recovered!

All I really want is my truck back, which I don't think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. Am I entitled to compensation? And from whom? The towing company sold it before it's stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. Do I have legal recourse here?

I was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. I am a senior and about to graduate. They reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. They only gave me info for one class.

I only started college this year, but after contacting them about the money they have almost completely ignored me. They gave me vague answers about how they'll get this sorted out ""by the end of the school year"" (WTF?). I suspect that the organization has run out of money and is shutting down. Their website is no longer up, and they are no longer running their yearly high school tournament.

There was no written contract, but the money was promised. They also made a Facebook post after the tournament saying ""Congratulations to this team (mine) for winning $2000 each in scholarship money!"", and included a photo.

Thanks in advance! This is a massive amount of money for me (broke college student) so any advice is greatly appreciated!

After taking my information she told me that i had already collected my remaining balance Tuesday afternoon. I denied me ever doing this, and was told she could not help me and i would need to come in Thursday morning to talk to head pharmacist to explain the situation.

Thursday morning i went and talked to the head pharmacist who:

* Insisted that i already collected my remaining balance. Which i denied repeatedly.
* I told her to confirm via their security cameras that it was not me collecting the medication, which she did. 
* Now repeatedly insisted that i allowed someone else to collect my remaining balance. I told her i have no one allowed to do that on my file, except my parents. Who neither of them is alive anymore. 
* Unfortunately she told me she could not help me further, and i need to report my medication as stolen. Which i refused to do, because i never received my balance, and i felt that would be me admitting fault on my part.
* I called my Doctor and explained my situation, and he immediately called the pharmacy. The head pharmacy tech told him that they dispensed my prescription to me. He told me unfortunately he cannot re-issue me my prescription, unless the pharmacy admits wrong doing. 
* The head pharmacist basically told me she could do nothing for me, and asked me to leave or security would be called.

I went home and called the corporate number of the pharmacy, and explained everything to them. They agreed to open an investigation however told me this could take well over a month to get a result, they gave me a case number, and recommended that i make alternative arrangements with my doctor. 

On Friday i called my doctor again, and explained everything one more time, he was sympathetic however he told me he cannot re-issue my prescription unless the pharmacy admits they screwed up because it is a controlled substance.

(Update) Cease and Desist letter after posting a review on YT and tricked by developer for address/name,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z5mms/i_do_reviews_i_reveiced_a_cease_and_desist_after/?utm_source=reddit-android

So it's been an interesting two months, after my post I started contacting a few attorneys locally and eventually had to call the state bar for a referral because of the type of possible laws not a lot of people handle that like a normal lawyer does that's usually family/criminal.

I finally found an attorney that understood what I was talking about and wanted a link to the Reddit post and agreed with the majority of the top advice I received. 

He accepted a small retainer of $250 to respond to the cease and desist I received and a few possible future letters/calls.

He responded asking them exactly what statements I made that were false and requested exact times in the video that the statements were made. Since I previously privated the video we had to give them a different link. 

He also outlined what will happen should they continue stating that during discovery he will be requesting all communication between QA, play testing, developers, and management to see if they were aware of any of these bugs/issues that may compromise a customer's experience while playing etc.

It also included a paragraph basically calling them out for reaching out to me and lying about ""swag and wanting feedback"" to get my information to send a cease and desist instead of going through the proper legal channels to obtain this and the fact that I still have yet to receive any ""swag"" that this is clearly the case.

Also included that they need to preserve all the emails they sent to other reviewers because it's of interest in the possible upcoming legal action. He also requested they preserve all sorts or other communication between QA, developers etc.

So after he had confirmed receipt of the letter we waited and waited. Nothing for about a month but then I received 3 large boxes containing games, posters, statues, a custom PS4 limited edition console, bobble heads, Funko pops, just every piece of swag I think they have for 3-4 of their games and a letter saying ""Sorry it took so long for us to get this swag out to you!""

My attorney then sent out another letter asking about the status and their position on the cease and desist and we received a letter back with only a few sentences basically saying they made a mistake and we can expect no further correspondence on the matter and that the video can be reinstated if we so wish. 

He sent out another asking about the lost ad revenue due to me having to private the video since they admitted it was a mistake. They sent out a check for $500 and some papers I needed to sign basically saying the issue is over and I won't sue them.

Thank you LA, I didn't get sued and after it all I came out ahead. I'm still not going to link my channel or the video or name the company in question but thanks for all your help!",legaladvice
Rear ended by a cop who pressured me not to report it [MA],"This is happening right now. I work at a dog daycare and was driving a group of pups back from the dog park, going the speed limit, when a car bumped into me. Turns out it was an unmarked police vehicle. Since I'm at work, I asked if I could just photograph his insurance information and file a claim later. He said that since he's police I would need to stay and wait to file an accident report. 

He kept emphasizing that this would be a long process, that the damage wasn't that severe, and that I should let it go. He also tried to accuse me of speeding, which I wasn't—this happened maybe 50 yards past a crosswalk at which I had stopped, so I don't even think it's possible for me to have been speeding unless I had floored it. It made me uncomfortable that he was so adamant about me not filing a report, like maybe this isn't his first accident, so I went ahead with filing it.

What should I expect to happen next? Is it true that he wasn't able to just give me his insurance so I could have moved on with my day? Can he make this out to be my fault somehow?

"My sister abandoned our autistic brother with me. Now 6 months later finally admitted that she won't be resuming custody, and has told me he is now ""my problem"" as she won't be coming back to Canada. Is this legal..?","I am in **Ontario, Canada** while my sister was in Vancouver BC.

My brother is on the spectrum, and he is someone who basically needs constant and around the clock care. He is in his 20's now, but mentally he is about \~8 years old.

Nearly a year ago my mom suddenly passed away due to a blood clot in the brain, it came out of nowhere and shocked our family and my dad passed a few years back from cancer. 3 years ago our mom had a will drawn up, and my older sister basically agreed in the event of something happening she would be responsible for my brother (there were a ton of reasons for this specifically the fact she lived within my brothers support network, while i am far away). In agreement with this my mom put aside a large amount of money for the purpose of my brothers well being.

My sister and her fiancee took my brother in for about 6 months, but it became very apparent that she misunderstood the amount of work required for his care. She asked if i would be willing to take him for a month or so while she went and took time off. I agreed simply because of the fact i am now a stay at home mom, but told her i couldn't do this for long.

One month turned into two, and then finally 4. She kept making excuse after excuse, but she finally agreed that she would take him when they got back from a vacation in Europe to visit her fiancee's family. When she got back she would let me know. Then basically nothing, absolutely fucking nothing for two months. Never responded to any of my emails, messages or phone calls.

Finally yesterday i received a long facebook message from her telling me:

* She isn't coming back to Canada, as she has decided to get married in Europe and live there with her fiancee.
* She isn't coming back for my brother, and said i needed to take care of him as he is now ""my problem"".
* She said she was sorry but she couldn't deal with him anymore.

She has blocked me on facebook, and her cell phone number no longer seems to work anymore.

I know this sounds cold, but i can't do this. I can't take care of my brother anymore. On top of this all the money that my parents put aside for my brother, aside from a bit she sent me early on i have no idea where that money is or where it went.

I have tried a variety of services, and explained my situation about my brother, but i have discovered there is basically fuck all help for me. I was told it could take several years to find a place for him in a care facility, and it is just wait list after wait list.

So like my question is, can my sister really just abandon him like this? Isn't there some sort of law against basically abandoning someone your responsible for? I know he isn't a child anymore, but mentally he is.

To clarify a few things, i love my brother, but he is far too much for me to handle and my toddler. We have been struggling to make ends meet financially, with the increased upkeep cost. To the point where i worry for our future. I can't leave my brother alone, so i working is out of the question. ",legaladvice
"Purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. Now what? [NY, Putnam County]","Mostly what's in the title. Condo was vacant for roughly 60 days between closing and our attempt to move in. Upon getting there with our belongings, we discovered a new deadbolt on the door - the unit was vacant and had no deadbolt when we did our final walkthrough the day before closing. Tried knocking on the door. got no answer, reached out to our realtor, who contacted the seller's agent and asked that he get in touch with his client to find out what the hell is going on, but at this point we assumed squatters. About an hour later, a young man showed up and produced a 36 month lease  which had been paid in advance. All $1 of it. He told us it's between us and his uncle, and headed into the apartment.

Our realtor is flabbergasted; he's encountered squatters and tenants who had to be evicted after refusing to leave at the end of the lease, but never anything like this. The police won't touch this either, which makes perfect sense given the context - dude has a lease that predates our contract (albeit by one day) so as far as they're concerned it's a civil matter. The condo association is incredibly hands-off about owners leasing their properties (which is part of why this place was appealing, as I plan to rent it out myself when we are ready to buy a house), so they want nothing to do with the situation.

To me it seems like the lease should be completely void given that it was executed in ridiculously bad faith, but I am nowhere near a lawyer. To that end, the attorney who handled the transaction for us is out of town till next week - my understanding is that he's camping or hiking or hunting or something along those lines and is basically incommunicado for the time being, but I am waiting to hear back from his admin to get details (he's a one man firm so there are no associates that can help me in the interim).

I have no idea what to do here. Luckily the truck we were using to move is owned by a friend's business, and they have graciously offered to let us store our belongings in it while we get this sorted. Unluckily, my wife and I turned in the keys to our old apartment this morning, and as such we have nowhere to go.

I'd be willing to do a cash for keys thing to get this guy out of our apartment but he won't speak to us. Beyond that, do I have grounds to evict him? If so, how do I recoup the expenses associated with this whole clusterfuck, sue the seller? Does the tenant have any sort of liability here? If I do pull of a successful cash for keys arrangement, can I sue the seller for that as well? What about the friend who is letting us keep all of our stuff in one of his trucks, does he have any grounds to sue or does the fact he is voluntarily letting us use the truck take that out of the equation? Is there anything else that I am not thinking of?

I am shaking with anger right now so I apologize for this being a bit of a a rambling novel, and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

Edit: Location is New York, specifically Putnam County.

**Update (4:45PM):** I just got a call from my attorney's admin. He's apparently close enough to civilization to have an internet connection in his cabin and should be checking in with her shortly, at which point she'll have him reach out to me.

Pretty sure the 16 year old who lives above us is living alone. Is this neglect?,"Single mom and her daughter live above us (in CT). The daughter is a music student and we constantly have to hear her playing guitar or keyboard WITH AN AMP, singing (more like screeching) into a microphone, and producing shitty beats with too much base. 

She plays music WAY louder than she needs to to practice. Its louder than our TV much of the time. Her mother usually leaves every night before 8 (if she has been home at all that day) and comes home in the morning to (presumably) shower and then go to work. Mother MIGHT be home 1 or 2 nights per week.

Her daughter obviously takes advantage of this and has friends over. They are so loud some nights that they are clearly drunk. Other nights she will sing into a microphone until midnight. They wake us up all hours of the night on weekends and weekdays. The mother complains to us that her apartment smells like weed ""all the time"" and blames it on us, since we are below her. Preeeeeetty sure it's her own kid, though, because we don't smoke in or around the house. 

So this kid basically lives along with very little supervision. Is this legal? Should we get cops involved? We've been hesitant because we fear retaliation, but can't stand this anymore and need to do something!",legaladvice
TX - Update. I informed the father of his possible two kids who are married to each other.,"Met up with him after work and got right down to it. I informed him that his son in law had asked me to find his dad and that I have a very good idea of who it was. 

He did not take the news well when I told him his son in law was probably his son. Lots of screaming. Lots of blaming me. Eventually lots of apologizing to me. I told him I would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. I told him to get a dna test done and that I would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a DNA test being done first to prove it. He agreed this was a good idea. His thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. I told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

I told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a DNA test proving parentage. 

He agreed without any hesitation. 

So now its a waiting game. The lab I use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. The dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. I did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

UPDATE: Today I came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from,"Delaware, USA

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

I found the fence on Thursday. Saturday I was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. So on Friday morning, I had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. I called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

I took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

I also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. If I find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, I'll be informing the police.

So, on Friday afternoon, I removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which I put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

We still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now I don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. I will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

Thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if I learn who built the fence I will be sure to update again!",legaladvice

On top of all that it seems they tried to seemingly destroy everything in our house. All the new appliances that came with our house are basically ruined, all toilets, and bathtubs seemingly look like they have been smashed with a hammer. In some places it looks like someone tried to rip the fucking wiring out of our walls, etc. Basically our house I guess basically as a final fuck you to us.

Our lawyer has basically told us the odds of us getting anything of value out of them is basically nil. I wanted them to go to jail for breaking and entering but apparently it doesn't work like that.

I purchased a vehicle and was assaulted by the salesmen when I went to pick it up several days later. What type of lawyer should I contact? Additional details in post,"A bit of a doozy...

I purchased a car Saturday in Massachusetts. I paid 10k in a bankers check and financed the remainder. Upon pickup on Tuesday,  I was told I was given a rebate (which was not in any of my paperwork) that I was not entitled to. The dealership told me I need to pay $500 or else I can't have the vehicle. At this point, I already had a contract, the keys to the vehicle, had the vehicle insured, signed over the title to my old vehicle...everything I needed aside from registration. As far as I was concerned it was my property at the time. After a verbal back and forth the salesman got tough and told me to back down or he would F me up etc etc. After threatening me, I told him he couldn't do that. He then rushed me and violently pushed me . At that point, for my own safety, I tackled him and we were separated by all the other employees. During the separation he hit me several more times because I was the only individual restrained by the other employees. The other employees collected my paperwork that was lost in the altercatiin and shredded it. The police were called and I filed a report. I have yet to request the police press charges. I declined to initially because after the altercation they had possession of my $10k, my new car and the title to my old car. I had no paperwork other thank the bankers check made to and cashed by the company, and an autopolocy with associated VIN.  Police told me they couldn't help with the civil side regarding the cars and money, only the assault. If I requested the charges be pressed I couldn't help but think i would have been out that money and both cars for a long time as the civil thing plays out.  I sustained a potentially broken nose and a medium cut to the knee... and what sucked the most for me...the brand new watch, which my wife gave me little more than 3 weeks ago as a gift on our wedding day...is destroyed.

They said I'd have it back by the end of the week. That would leave me with enough time to finish the last section of my thesis paper. 

I got a call yesterday that it would actually take 2 weeks because they had to ship my laptop out for data recovery. Tried to explain that was unacceptable but nothing could be done about it. 

I'm not looking for technical advice. I need legal advice that I can use for my college and ex. My advisor said he can't give me an extension, which means I won't graduate next month and very likely could just fail out. Is there any legal basis for forcing my school to give me an extension? My paper and all of my qualitative data was deleted. Plus my backups were deleted. This whole situation is beyond my control. 

Is there any action I can take against my ex?

Again, nothing unusual. I woke up on Monday and discovered all my emails were deleted (which is where I made weekly backups of my thesis). When I checked my hard drive, the folder with my thesis was deleted too. I freaked out, asked reddit for advice and took my computer to the geek squad. 

Texted my ex later on Monday asking if she deleted my thesis and didn't hear back. Her friend called me in tears saying my ex deleted everything and feels incredibly sorry and guilty. She did it because she saw me flirting with someone at the party and got jealous. 

I have a fellowship lined up after graduation that I'm not eligible for if I don't actually graduate. I need an extension until I get my files back. I'm completely completely screwed if I can't turn in my thesis. ",legaladvice
Roommate flushed an expensive family heirloom down the toilet.,"So I'm a Sophomore in college and have been living with a randomly paired roommate who I believe has some form of special needs. If the room is messy he gets into some serious anger fits where he will scream and yell at me about not cleaning up and then proceed to throw all of my stuff around the room. This lasts around 20 minutes and he always apologises profusely and cleans everything up and says it won't happen again. 

Just yesterday he had another crazy anger fit and took my watch off my desk and flushed it down the toilet and proceeded to scream hysterically. The watch was quite an expensive Rolex passed down from my father from his father so it has a lot of significance within the family. I've tried calling the school and sewage system but I've had no luck yet in retrieving it. 

I have moved rooms and spoken to the RA but they have not really offered any significant advice. I have not spoken to my roommate yet as I am both too angry and scared to approach him. I have not spoken to my father yet as I know it will complete devastate him. 

I honestly have no idea how to approach this and any help would be appreciate it. What's the best course of action here?

Edit: thanks for all the support and advice here! I really appreciate everyone who's commented and liked this to help me get the best advice possible. A report has been filed with the police and I've been moved to a different room. Still waiting for a response from my roommate. Watch has not been found yet, but maintenance said its tough to do this on a Sunday (for some reason). 

Edit 2: Thank you for all the kind responses and all the advice, was not expecting this to blow up like this! By some miracle emergency maintenance found it earlier today in the trap along with some other items of mine that he must have thrown down there which they said clogged the toilet. Unfortunately the watch doesn't seem to be working but it should be an easy repair. That being said, I had another altercation with my roommate where he tried breaking into my room. Called the college police and it looks like they may have detained him or taken him away somewhere. It's been a hectic day but it looks like the situation is being handled. Thank you to everyone ❤️

[Update] [ME / CA] My teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.,"Well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. Christ.

Yesterday afternoon, after I made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), I called her gynecologist. (I have uterine issues so I got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

She was very understanding, and offered to stay late if I wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. So, I called the police, let them know I was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

My daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when I explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

The doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the STI tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. Though I know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, I'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

After the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. He sat down with my daughter in our living room, while I hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear I'd hear it.)

The detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in Maine I needed to speak to. I made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. He left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. He also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

After he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on Facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. Within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that I make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. I told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

This morning, I got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. His assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in CA, the custody arrangement is in CA, and it will be amended in CA (since CA is her state of residency), and in CA they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. He also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she HAD to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

I have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that I could help her as needed. Right now she's mostly been playing World of Warcraft and eating junk food, but I feel like at least right now I'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

I want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. I will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.",legaladvice
"Apartment complex installed ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment without my consent, is asking me to sign a lease addendum consenting to personal data collection and agreeing to be financially responsible for maintenance and upkeep of said devices. What are my options? [Colorado]","I got a notice via email a while back that the Apartment complex where I live in Denver was going to be installing ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment. I didn't respond because I assumed I would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  I was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while I was traveling for work. 

Now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying I requested this and asking that I consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, I am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if I do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

Some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""You have requested that we provide [Insert Name of SmartDevice Vendor] in your unit. We agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

I did not request this.

`""Information collected by [Insert Name of SmartDevice Venor] (""Information""): We have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""Personal Information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. Front Door Lock:- Entry activity by time and code used- Technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

This language is pretty much the same for Thermostat, SmartPlugs and Switches, Hub, Water Sensor and software to use it all.

`""Information Sharing: Anonymized and aggregated information collected by the Service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. Recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

Additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if I lose or damage any of them, I am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""If a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

What are my options? I really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but I also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that I did not want or consent to being installed.

I'm safe, and I'm out.

I organised a place to stay with a coworker. I have new bank accounts and all my paperwork. My dad has some regular sport meetings on Saturdays that go for hours so I prepared everything the week before, found where my paperwork was and walked out. I've been approved for a rental and I move there soon.

I contacted two police stations near us beforehand who both understood dad's nature straight away when I told them he'd been telling me I couldn't move out because of a time debt and they told me it wasn't a thing. 

I took copies of all of his paperwork too because while I was getting ready to move I found most of what I knew about my parents separating was a lie. There was never a 50/50 custody agreement and my mother never ran off with me in violation to that. My dad had been held for several domestic violence incidents when I was a child and he was only to see me on special holidays and only under strict supervision. He's never been violent to me, but in the papers he had hidden was evidence of a trust available to me when I'm 21. Some of the specific wording is it can go to me as an individual or to my carer if that is required. I think my dad was trying to make himself up as my carer without me knowing. I did not find the letter I read when I was a kid from dad's lawyer but like you all said that was probably fake.

After I moved out my dad did try to contact the police. They came to my coworker's address because they had to, but also let me know that yes my dad was trying to say I couldn't look after myself. His words were that I was ""borderline retarded and being abused"".

I've been back to Canada to visit my aunts and uncle, and found the aunt who was named to manage my trust died very soon after my mother. We're still working out the details with a Canadian lawyer about some confusion over who handles what and how now but I have the full support of my remaining aunt and uncle who are the same great people I remember. They were really worried about me when I went to live with dad and had tried to contact me so many times.

"New York - I've been visited by CPS 8 times, to enquire about a child I don't have. At what point it becomes harassment or stalking?","There's a CPS agent that seems to be convinced that I have a child and I'm locking the child in my home. First time I was visited, I was very understanding. I allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. Everything seemed fine. Obviously no child and no evidence of one, because I don't have a child.

This was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until I stopped cooperating. I told her that from now on the only way I'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. A few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. The officer told me that it will be a lot easier if I allowed them to look at my house, I allowed the officer to do that by himself. Again, no child was found. His search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

Two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times I have refused to talk to her. Once, as I left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. It definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. I called the police but it went nowhere. I have called the CPS office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. This last incident happened this last Thursday.

This woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. Everyone has told her that I don't have a child. 

This definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. If this was a legitimate CPS operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, I'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance I guess? But they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. So maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

This is really going too far and is affecting my life. I actually fear for my safety now. I will install security cameras this week and will call the police if I found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the CPS.

Do I have a legal recourse here? Like filing a restraining order against the CPS (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? This definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. Not sure how stalking is defined legally. What's the best way to stop her?

[Original Post here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b2mi6a/nc_sold_them_a_used_car_now_they_sued_me_over_it/)

This morning we had our court date, and let me tell you it was pretty quick. Got in at 8:32, out by 8:50. The plaintiff presented her case, in which she said that we hadn't disclosed an airbag light that was on the dash, and that the check engine light code we told them about was false information because it actually turned out to be another issue. Said the vehicle had more rust than they originally knew about, and that they hadn't driven it because a mechanic told them it was unsafe to drive. 

We presented our defense, clearly stating they had the opportunity to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic, but chose to take our word for it; and that we brought all known faults to their attention prior to selling them the vehicle. Anything they found after they took ownership wasn't our issue anymore, they had all chances to make a proper decision prior. We brought up the FTC's Private Sale guide stating that all cars sold from private party to private party are ""as-is"" unless otherwise stated. We neither expressed nor implied any warranties. 

Long story short, the Magistrate dismissed the case with prejudice to the Plaintiff  because NC is a ""Buyer Beware State"" and the buyer should have done all in their power to make an informed decision before purchasing the vehicle. They have 10 days to appeal, but I doubt that's gonna happen. 

Thanks to everyone that commented and gave my wife and I more information on the original post. It sure helped!

TL;DR: Magistrate heard the case, dismissed it because the buyer should have done more to inspect the vehicle.

So basically, these people have been in my house for no more than 20 days, but they claim to have been there for long enough to be tenants. Do I need to treat them as tenants?",legaladvice
"A bartender tipped himself $5,000 on my debit card and my local police told me i'm not allow to press charges as long as they're willing to give it back.","Basically a bartender gave himself a nice tip on my debit card after only spending about $30 on a few drinks. My account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


I went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. He said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. I get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but I said I still wanted to press charges. The officer said I literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

So i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

I was refunded the 5k to my account, but now I have a shit load of overdraft fees because I use PayPal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, HBO, etc.) Every time PayPal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. I've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but I only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. I do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and I can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. Every time I check my account, it's just further in the negative and I don't know what to do.

Parents took $6000 from me without my consent. Resulted in homelessness and prevented university education.,"I live in Alberta, Canada. About a year and a half ago, my family got a huge surprise from my great grandfather, who gave us each $5000 with the exception of my mother. I was 17 at the time, and my mother and uncle went to the bank with me to set up a joint account between me and my uncle since my great grandfather wrote the cheques in both mine and his name for some reason.

My father, who was an alcoholic at the time, stated that it would be best that all of the bank cards of the newly created accounts be in his and my mothers hands so that we wouldnt make reckless purchases. At the time, I didnt mind since I was planning to save the money for university, but the main reason I gave the card to them was because my father was not one to cross. Hes done things to me in the past, and ive been scared of him since.

All was fine until a couple months later when I decided to pitch into my savings with my job, only to find that the $5000 was gone through multiple purchases.

The tap function was on the card.

I confronted my mother immediately, away from my father, and she agreed to pay back $400 a month. However, this only happened for three months. Around the same time this started, my great grandfather, unaware of what happened, sent another $5000. Due to a plane ticket I bought to see my gf this August as well as a $500 slash to my paycheque, I was left with about $1000. However, after we transferred the money into my brothers account to keep my father as calm and stable as possible, his account was locked, my mother refusing to open the account.

I burst under the pressure, and was given the boot. While I was in the homeless shelter, i kept asking for the $1000 back to get shelter to find my mother already unlocked the account and gave it to my father. 

I had to drop my classes in high school right before the diplomas because of this. I was unable to get a credit card approved by the bank for application because of the ridiculous transactions, and found that my great grandfather was going to send another $10,000 before he learned of what my parents did. A couple months later, i was let back in, but now theyre telling me ""its gone, money is the root of all evil"". 

I lost my girlfriend after cancelling the trip, lost my university aspirations, and lost much more that id rather not reveal here. What should I do? 

UPDATE: After seeing all of the suggestions here and seeing just how many people apparently have my back, I decided to leave the house and go back to the youth shelter while I get myself a lawyer and gather the necessary evidence. Thank you all, I never thought this would blow up like this when I went to sleep last night. Knowing a couple thousand strangers have my back seems to give me more courage to go about with this action than I did before.

You see, I have about $650-700 in known debt right now, and they're asking me to pay $250 a month for a room even worse than the unfinished basement I was sleeping in before, and giving my mattress away, as I found out just now during the moving preparations. It's still $500 cheaper than the room I paid for per month after getting out of the shelter at my friend's place, but it doesn't feel right, especially with how they're consistently acting as if what they did was nothing. If you guys have any more advice, I'll be sure to take it and update you all with the situation. ",legaladvice

He went through my account, got it paid, and refunded me $125 in late fees as a credit. I actually overpaid $5, still, but it's mostly a win without having to go to court.

I'm being sued by the at fault driver who doesn't know I have dash cam footage,"Hello, 

I got hit in Brampton, Ontario in October 2018. 

I'll try to keep it short! Last October a driver ran a red light while she was making a left hand turn  (in a 2 lane left turning street) and hit me as I started going through the green. 

I called 911 but no one came because no one was injured so we got towed to the police station and made reports. No one got charged with anything, even though she should have imo. They didn't ask questions or care. No ambulance came, no major injuries. 

The insurance was easy, 100% not at fault for me, all her fault (as I was told is the case for 99% of these types of accidents, where one driver turning left hits a driving going straight). No issues what so ever, they paid off my car and that's it I moved on. 

Fast forward about 5 months and I received mail that I believe was sent to my insurance company requesting a bunch of information and that she intends to take legal action against me for what I believe is lost wages, guess she got hurt. 

Her police report is attached which includes what she says happened. It doesn't make any sense as she wrote ""he had the green and got hit by me making the turn on a yellow light"" 

The funny thing is, I don't think she knows a driver that was in the inside turning lane beside her stopped and gave me the dash cam footage he had. This footage shows he and the car in-front of him stopping for the red, and you can clearly see her car coming into frame in the outside turning lane on his right after the light is already red, she flies through the red and hits me as I'm moving forward at the green. All very clear on the footage. 

My question is, how can she sue if she's at fault? I'm sure I'll win a case with the footage I have, but what is the likelihood she will have to pay my legal fees? That's what I'm most worried about. 

Any thoughts on this situation is helpful.

Update: Neighbor touched my son,"

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor\_touched\_my\_son\_nj/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bwkgcw/neighbor_touched_my_son_nj/)

I know the original post didn't get a lot of attention and there probably isn't much demand for an update, but I did want to thank the people who commented and maybe give some guidance on expectations for anybody who might have the horrible luck to fall into a similar situation. Also it's just not something we want to talk about with friends/family…. So call it therapy for me.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

TLDR for the 1st post: Last Monday, soon after I left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf & mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Update: On Tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. My wife and I interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. After that the detective contacted the county prosecutor's office.

An hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. Once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and I to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. The detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

From there we went home.

That afternoon, Neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. I opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. Soon after I went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. When I got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

For the most part, Wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. We did not see Neighbor all day. Wednesday night, we came to know why. A detective called to let us know Neighbor had been taken into custody on Tuesday night (while I was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (I assume arraignment).

Thursday morning a woman from the state DCF/CP&P office came to the house. She made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & I together. To my mind, this was actually a good thing.  She was able to let us know that Neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (I don't recall exactly what they are). She also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – Neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in California.

2 – Neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on Tuesday evening.

From there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. We will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

While she was there I asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if Neighbor was likely to be free again soon. She was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

Friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. She informed us that Neighbor's hearing was set for Monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. She wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have Neighbor remain in custody.

Here's the thing. Neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. I advised the detective that we were ok with Neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. She confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. We agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom Neighbor lives should have input.

That brings us up to date and, to be honest, I am torn. I HATE what this man did. I hate that it has happened before, and I never want it to happen again. With that said, at first I was unsure as to whether or not Neighbor even knew what he did. He clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. But he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. As he admitted the act to the arresting detective. I get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute Lennie from Of Mice & Men, and that tears my heart out. I don't think he really understands, and I don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. At the same time, he touched my son. If there were no clear impairment, I would want to take a baseball bat to his head. But there is, and instead I just feel like shit for everyone involved. This sucks, full stop.

On a more selfish note, the Megan's law registry. There are a handful of homes for sale in the area. Until now, my wife and I were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. That hope is now over. Because Neighbor's history all predates Mega's Law, he was not on the registry. Now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. I realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that Neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. To repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

Sorry for the book, and if the Mods see fit to remove the update… as it's not all that particular to legal matters, I understand. Honestly, I just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

Thanks to anyone who reads through.",legaladvice
I'm a pedestrian who waved in an SUV in a narrow gap and he got into an accident and he's threatening to sue me.,"This happened a few days ago. I live in Philly and I was walking along a busy street and I see this SUV at a one-way narrow street waiting to move forward at a green light. There is a small car ahead of him that's turning right. The SUV wasn't moving past the car because he thought he didn't have enough room. I saw that he did and I just gave him a thumbs up that he can go. He ended up hitting the other car (he was trying to avoid the curb I guess and turned at the last second). 

They got into a bit of an argument and shared info and decided to call the police to make a claim I think. I didn't really listen but the other guy (in the small car) asked me to hang back and provide a witness in case he needs it since I saw the whole thing. They both shared each others insurance and ID.

The SUV guy asked me for my ID for witness too for his insurance claim. Soon after he took a picture of my ID on his phone he said I was the reason he moved and that he will have to make a claim against me. He is threatening to sue me and said that he would rather just send me the damage bill of both of the cars. I felt bad because I gave him the thumbs up that there was room but he DID turn at the last second. The other guy was also annoyed that I shouldn't have told him to go. 

He called and left a VM that I need to act soon because if he makes a claim in a court it would lead to a lot of legal fees for both of us or something. He said that if I agree to pay I can just pay half of the damages.

I'm worried that it's going to be a huge amount and I don't want to go to court. If it goes to court will I have my credit ruined? Sorry I don't know too much legal stuff!

Edit: Now he is saying that my future will be screwed and my credit score is going to be messed up and that there is a possibility that I may be criminally convicted?? I am an immigrant here on a visa and I am worried that it's going to affect me!

Edit 2: Hey guys, thank you so much for your support! This has been really helpful. However, I am getting conflicting advice here. Some are saying that the other person (SUV guy) has a case and it seems like there have been cases similar to this. Some are telling me that I am absolutely guilty and should have everything taken from me! Also I am not sure who Ayan Rand (legal author?) is and how this affects me? I spoke with a legal hotline service and they said that they are not sure of the laws but I need to get a notarized letter from the SUV guy saying that i won't be sued if I choose to pay. I am honestly super scared and stressed that my immigration status will be affected (like the guy said). Should I be contacting immigration lawyer too?",legaladvice
"[Manitoba, CANADA] (UPDATE) My cousin's landlord enacted a new rule that states ""Lights Out By 10PM"" - and is enforced by the landlord using the breakers to shut off all power, despite my cousin paying for his own electricity.","Previous post can be found here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bsdyro/manitoba_canada_my_cousin_lives_in_a_basement/

My cousin and I want to thank all of you for the incredible amount of advice and support you have offered him. He couldn't believe how many people cared, and was touched by the very kind messages we have received by you fine folks. Thank you so much! This situation was resolved rather quickly, so thankfully it's all over.

Now for the update: My cousin is moving out this weekend. He spoke to the landlord several times, citing several laws he was breaking and how my cousin pays for his own power and therefore he shouldn't have his electricity shut off just because the landlord wants to save a few dollars. Also, one of you messaged me to let me know that breakers aren't meant to be turned on and off frequently, and that he is going to burn out all of his fuses if he continues. The landlord refused to listen and told him he shouldn't believe everything he reads on the internet. My cousin went ahead and printed out many comments from you folks, as well as copies of the laws he was breaking, and he told him that if he doesn't stop he would get authorities and lawyers involved. Needless to say, the landlord did not like that one bit. After an argument, the landlord stated that my cousin should move out as he didn't trust him anymore (???) and my cousin was genuinely sad as he liked this man and had considered him a friend before all of this. The landlord said that he will not change his mind no matter how hard my cousin fights it, and that it's best that he just moves out.

Anyways, the landlord told him that if he moves out he will void the lease and return the rent he has paid up for June, July, and August, as well as the security deposit - all under the condition that he moves out by the end of the month and doesn't get lawyers or anybody else involved. My cousin decided to cut his losses and move on. Luckily, my cousin is a minimalist and has very little to pack and move. He is going to be moving in with his girlfriend, which he is very happy about, and he will not be pursuing anything against the landlord as he got all of his money back (about $3000) and he doesn't have to deal with James ever again.

While my cousin didn't get the outcome he wanted, he still got a pretty good deal. He was planning on living with his girlfriend sometime in the near future, so this event just sped things along. My cousin and I honestly feel bad for James as the man has gone through a lot and has had a pretty rough life. Still, this doesn't excuse his behaviour and nonsensical rules.

And that is it. Thank you all again for your help and support, it was honestly overwhelming. Take care, you beautiful people.

EDIT: Since I'm getting nasty messages, I figured I should edit this to let everyone know that I have finally convinced my cousin to report him. He will be reporting the moment he has moved out - which is Saturday. We are also looking to get him help for his declining mental health. Also, my cousin already received every dime owed to him, in cash, and he received a revised contract stating that the lease was voided as of June 1st, and that no further payments will be required.

MN: Someone landed their hot air balloon in my yard and my dogs ripped it.,"This past weekend a man with two passengers from a local event went up in a hot air balloon, something went awry and he landed it in my yard.

Private driveway being used as public roadway and im being accessed for its upkeep (FL),"Purchased 30 acres of land and built a house several years back in central Florida, had a driveway installed that cuts across the center of my property allowing me to exit on either of two main roads.

I now have traffic using my driveway as a shortcut between the two roads up to and including 18 wheelers and other large vehicles since using my driveway cuts off nearly half an hour of travel time between two cities.

I installed pillars and gates on both ends of the driveway and marked it private property but the gates were torn down and the pillars knocked over.

I have contacted the county about it and they sent out a guy from code compliance who looked around for a few minutes and left.

i have now received a notice about not keeping the roadway to state standards and that the county will be out to perform maintenance bringing the roadway up to standards, ie. widening it and repaving which i will be personally responsible for paying for.

Ive told them if they want it to be a public road then fine buy me out and ill move elsewhere but they refuse to do so.

As of right now i have removed half the driveway past my house and put up signs and markers stating dead end road and now the county is threatening to have me arrested for destruction of public property.

before anyone asks, no, there are no easements on this property anywhere near the area the driveway goes through and no easements in any form that travel in that direction on the property, closest thing is a power company easement along the southern edge of the land.

[MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm being accused of cheating in a math exam. I am 16 years old. I got a perfect score in the exam and the teacher asked me to stay after the class and she told me that she knows I cheated. I didn't cheat. My math has always been good except last year when I was dealing with depression. She says she knows someone of my mental faculties will never be able to get a perfect score so I must have cheated.

I told her that I didn't cheat and I'm offended at the accusation. Two days ago I was asked to see the principal who said the same thing, that I should confess to cheating and tell them how I did it so that they can stop other students from doing it. He more or less threatened me ""this can go very well or very bad for you depending on your cooperation with us.""

I told him that I'm happy to retake a new exam right now or at any other time to prove that I didn't cheat but he said that I could have had time to prepare since the time my teacher talked to me. I told him that if their evidence for my cheating is my lack of mental faculties then no amount of studying should make a difference? He still did not agree for me to take another exam to prove that I could get that score.

Yesterday I was asked to his office again and he told me that he knows about how some students are cheating and offered me a clean slate if I let them access my social media and emails to find out who they are and if I give them evidence of other students cheating he will let me retake the exam. I have no knowledge of what he is talking about and I declined access to my social media and email.

I'm now suspended for disobedience of school staff and lack of cooperation for proving my innocence from a cheating charge. This to me sounds very unfair and I can't help but feel like I'm being targeted here for maybe a personal reason? Because this does not make any sense.

Geico told the other driver that their duties of subrogation had been met and he was on his own for this, so he showed up with his own lawyer for the initial hearing. The day after the hearing, that lawyer then contacted Geico, seemingly disputed their stance on subrogation, and then Geico contacted me with a settlement offer of the amount for which I was suing.

So in the end, Geico paid me the total replacement value of the vehicle as I saw it.",legaladvice
[California] I cancelled tattoo appointment because the tattoo artist was high AF. They're slandering me on FB and refuse to pay back safety deposit,"I had an appointment for a huge tattoo that was estimated at about 2000$. When I made the appointment everything seemed fine and professional, and I made a safety deposit of 500$ which is not at all unusual.

When I turned up to the appointment a month later, I noticed the artist was super stoned (red eyes, reeking of weed, slurred speech...) to the point that I didn't feel comfortable getting tattooed by him. I requested a new appointment with another artist. The lady at the reception didn't understand my problem, became insulting and refused to offer me either my safety deposit back or a new appointment. Finally she called somebody else (higher up the chain apparently) on the phone who confirmed they would transfer the deposit back to my account. Stupidly I assumed the problem was resolved and left.

Not only didn't they not transfer it back, they proceeded to make an angry post on their facebook page about how 'some people' just cancel appointments without notice and then have the 'audacity' to demand their money back. For a few minutes the post included a link to my name until they presumably deleted it. 

So here I am with 500$ less and no tattoo, was I legally 'in the right' to refuse being tattooed by someone under the influence - like, would this count as a legit reason? I was honestly worried it would turn out shit. What do I do next?",legaladvice
Ex fails drug test giving birth to her baby and now DSS wants to do a home visit with me.,"So the backstory goes like this: 

Ex and I had a son together. She decided one day to split and go live the party life. I take our son and move on and meet and marry my now wife. Wife and I buy a house and have a new baby ourselves. Ex meets someone and they become meth heads together. At that point I sought custody of our son and won. Our custody arrangement states that I have primary care and she is to only see him every other weekend supervised at/by her parents. Which for a long time she rarely, if at all showed up. Ex and new boyfriend have extremely volatile and abusive relationship, she gets pregnant and new boyfriend leaves. Ex appears to have gotten it together enough now that she's pregnant. Or so it appeared.

On to the issue. 

Ex gives birth to new baby. I get a phone call THAT DAY from dss saying that they'd like to come do a home visit to check on my son because she failed a drug test (for marijuana) when she gave birth. This was not the first instance during the pregnancy that dss was involved. From my understanding, she failed for the same reason early in the pregnancy so I guess dss kept her on their radar. So dss calls me explains what's happening and even asks if I'd be willing to do a drug test as well.

I have and want as little as possible to do with my ex. As I stated, i moved on and feel I'm doing well for me and my family. She is the unfortunate consequence for my young naivety. I do not regret having my son I just wish she wasn't his mother. 

So because of her actions and choices, I'm being dragged in by proxy. 

My job is very laborious and in the interest of full transparency, I myself (responsibly) smoke weed at night before bed. 

So what are my options as far as what dss is asking of me? Do I consent to everything? Do I seek legal representation? What happens if I take the drug test and fail? Will I lose my kids? 

This is really the most stressful situation for me and my wife who have nothing to do with her and her problems except the fact she's my sons mother

"[CA] While on vacation, my landlord came into the house, locked my cat up without food, water, and litter box for at least 3-4 days. Cat is ok, just a lot skinnier. We are breaking the lease to move out, is there any chance we can get our deposit back? Landlord lives overseas.","San Francisco, CA

Hello, as the title stated, my landlord came by when we were on vacation (we knew about it), and started complaining about the house. One of the complaints was that the cat was roaming the house freely. We texted him and said that if you are locking up the cat, make sure she had her water, food, and litter box. 

We came home to the doors closed, and cat was in a room without any of the three essentials.  She clawed the carpet trying to get out, peed and pood everywhere, and most importantly, visibly skinnier. Cat doesn't usually hang out in that room by herself, coupled with the landlord's complaint about her, we suspect he did it on purpose even though he insisted it was an accident. He is overseas now.

We don't really want the headache of pursuing legal action - cat is fine, just need to eat more, and we just want to move out asap and leave this behind us. Is here anything we can leverage to keep our deposit? Deposit is one month's rent.

Edits: Luci is really ok. Her appetite is much smaller now than before so we will spoil her with wet food for the next few days. Vet said play with her more to build up an appetite.

We don't want to sue for personal reasons. The landlord said they will pay for the damages of the room. 

The lease says if we move out we have to pay for all the remaining months' rent. We just want to say ""hey, this is the law, so we should get our deposit back, and not pay for the remaining months."" Should we get a lawyer to write up something?

The landlord's complaints of the house weren't legit. They were about a dirty mug on our desk, us using a 100ft cable along the wall (stuck neatly to the wall with adhesive) to reroute the internet from the living room into the bedroom, detergent residue in the detergent dish of our washer, a blanket on the sofa, some amazon boxes by the hallway, and other trivial things, you get the idea.",legaladvice
A lady at my gym suffered a seizure in the woman's locker room - she's now threatening to sue. I am 16 years old.,"(Pennsylvania) Hi there,

I am a 16 year old Junior in high school and work part-time at a gym.  I generally open the gym on weekends at 7 AM, and am alone in the building until our housekeeping staff come in at 8:00.
It starts out slow as members come in, and usually picks up around 9 when our Sales staff and General Manager come in.  The gym is a two story facility.

Earlier this morning around 8ish, I was approached by another member who stated there was a woman in the locker room (downstairs) who was laying on a bench shaking and presumably having a seizure.  So I RUN downstairs to the locker room, and sure enough, there is a woman shaking uncontrollably, but breathing.  I had my cell phone with me and immediately called 911.  I stayed on the phone with the dispatcher while waiting for the EMTs and Paramedics who arrived about five minutes later.

The dispatcher stated I should absolutely NOT try to perform CPR/First Aid (I am licensed) or move her, only to hold on to her make sure she did not fall off the bench.  The EMT's manage to revive? (I'm not sure if that is the appropriate term here) her and she gets wheeled out of the gym and to the hospital. I'd say we were in the locker room for about 20 minutes trying to convince her to go -- she was VERY stubborn.  There was a personal trainer who was there to help me with whom I am EXTREMELY grateful for.  I filled out an Incident report and filed it with our GM when he came in.

We have had concerns with this member before, as she has health issues.  The thing is, I have absolutely no idea how long she was suffering from a seizure for.  It looked as if she was in the midst of changing in to gym gear when it happened.  She checked in shortly after 7:15 AM.

I just received a text message from my GM and she is now threatening to sue us for her seizure.  Can she come after me personally??  As I said, I have no idea how long she was in that state for and I am terrified!  Thank you in advance for your answers!",legaladvice
Allergic child in son's class (NJ),"My son is in full-day kindergarten, and the kids eat lunch and snack in their classroom (not the cafeteria), because there is a child with severe allergies to multiple foods. I first of all want to say that I am completely fine making accommodations so a child with multiple, severe allergies can go to school. I can't imagine what his family goes through, and how nerve-wracking this is for them. At the same time, all twenty kids in the class are now affected.


- kids are only allowed to bring in pre-packaged foods and beverages so that the teacher can check the ingredients, so I can't pack him a sandwich- everything has to be in a sealed package.


- Parents are asked not to serve the children any of the severe allergens for breakfast before coming to school, including peanut butter, eggs and dairy. 


- Parents with pets are asked to dress their children right before leaving the house, to reduce pet dander on clothes. The teacher suggested (but it's not required) that kids can get dressed in the garage :/


Again, I am happy to comply as best I can, but I am curious at what point accommodations go from reasonable to unreasonable. 



Edit: Just to clarify, because a lot of people have questions:

- Kids wash their hands at the classroom sink as soon as they get to school, and before and after lunch. 

- Kids *are* allowed to bring packaged food that contains allergens (other then peanuts), just no liquid milk, yogurt or hard boiled eggs, and no snacks that leave a heavy powder residue like Doritos. Kids can get food ""delivered"" from the cafeteria, as long as it's not the above mentioned food. 

- there are only two classes per grade, so switching classes is not a sustainable option. 


My kid is doing okay for now, thanks to his love of pita and hummus, which comes in a prepackaged snack cup. However if next week he decides he doesn't like hummus, or if he is being too messy with the hummus (the kid with allergies is allergic to sesame, which is in hummus apparently) we'll be in a jam- no pun intended, I think actual jam is okay.",legaladvice
[CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"When my brother was 16 and I was 4 my grandmother set aside a share portfolio for us. As soon as we were old enough it was transfered into our own accounts, and it was only four years later that my brother dipped heavily into his and bought a new honda.

I knew about mine for much longer than he did before it became mine, and watched it grow since I understood what it was. By the time I was given full control it was already worth a ridiculous amount because a big portion of it was invested in apple, and I'm torn on using the funds locked up as they are, because Dad drilled it into me to leave it to grow until I'm forty something.

I don't talk much with my brother, he's done some stupid things to the family over the years and I didn't really grow up with him so all I usually hear about his life comes through dad. His new girlfriend works in law though, and I've received a formal letter from them both that the investments my grandmother made were designed to be for both of us to use not just for me alone, and his was only around $15000. The number is right but mine was only worth that at the time he spent it too. They want half of the value of mine now and his girlfriend has informed me if I don't give them access then the legal fees and fines would eat up my half and I'd be left with nothing.

The dividends alone support a huge part of my life and they've saved me a few times. If half of that disappeared it'd set me back years. I know it sounds selfish but I'm really used to having the extra income back me up when I've wanted to move. I've lived in four states by my own choice and I want to move and take in more before I settle down, if I ever do.

How likely is it they'll win and leave me with nothing? As far as I know there was no paperwork or will just my grandmother's word. She set up my brother's accounts when he turned 19, but she gave them to dad at the same time as my brother got his, and dad transfered the whole lot to me six years ago. For my share I have all the logins, the trading accounts and bank accounts are in my name, and the shares are all solely in my name too.

Thank you all for the wonderful advice, especially the fact that i am allowed to elect someone by proxy to do a unit inspection. I am never going to rent out my room again because this has been a massive battle.

My friend to rent the room for a single night because my land lord never responded about doing a walkthrough in time, and i was nervous. Turns out someone not Jane, but someone who identified himself as Janes coworker who works for Company X, met my friend in the parking lot. He gave him the keys. I don't know who this person is but i am not comfortable with some random person having my apartment keys.

My friend ironically was rejected by the concierge service, who asked him what room he was going to. (I forgot to tell my property manager about this). My friend got a full refund from AirBnB and him and his girlfriend were put up in a nice hotel a few blocks away by AirBnB for the night.

My property manager did respond and was kind enough to do a video walkthrough with me on speaker phone, and honestly my apartment is not in great shape at all. Apparently it stinks of cigarettes and weed, and there was a beer can being used as an ash tray, which is not allowed since our apartment building is ""Smoke Free"". I have stains/burns on my couch which looks like from cigarettes.

AirBNB has not done anything, and her listing is still up (i can't find any other listings of hers).

Jane however has been constantly sending me angry emails, about how i am impacting her financial situation, to how it is making her look bad as an AirBNB host. I told her bluntly the things that i saw from the walkthrough and how it stinks of smoke and we are a smoke free building. She claims she never signed any sort of agreement about condo rules, and i sent her a picture of the agreement she signed, including the condo rules page.

I offered to let her out of the lease, and not pay any more rent money for the remainder of the time on the lease. Skipping Novemeber/December. If she left, and had the apartment cleaned. She on the other hand demanded $5,000 for her to vacate from the apartment early. When i refused she told me ""I will do everything within my power to make ur life a living hell for fucking with me"".

My lawyer has made the complaint with the LTB, and he thinks it will most likely be resolved by the end of December. This has taught me a hard lesson, and i will never rent my apartment again.

Anyways thanks for the advice.",legaladvice

So it has been a while since my previous update, and I wish I could tell you all that it's because we were involved in a super exciting court battle (""No, YOU'RE out of order!"") but the truth is much more annoying and banal, as life tends to be. 

As we left it in the last post a couple months ago, our lawyer called the law firm who submitted the action against our property and said ""You have no grounds for this, take it off."" The paralegal he spoke to said the lawyer handling the case was out that day but would contact our lawyer soon.

They did not. For WEEKS. Despite everyone bugging them, they were very disinterested in resolving the issue. Color me shocked.

In the meantime, we're getting junk mail from law firms and mortgage management companies at least every 2-3 days, saying they can help us with this issue we don't have. The notices start to be addressed to us personally instead of the this other random guy who said he owned our house. This displeases us. I start keeping a little pile of these letters next to the stairs with copies of our mortgage payments notices from the bank, just in case.

This goes on for a while, long enough for my initial (!!!!!!!) anxiety to fade into more of an ""Eh."" situation. Until yesterday. 

Our lawyer finally got a response to his email from July, where he outlines everything and attached a preponderance of evidence showing we continue to own our house, and their response is, and I quote : ""We will remove the action."" Period. No Good Afternoon, no Sincerely. We will remove the action. A shart of an email after weeks of worry.

So with a whimper, we got what we wanted. Obviously we will continue to monitor everything until they actually do what they said they will, but it is a load off my mind. I wish I had something more exciting to tell you, but it seems in the legal world, exciting = bad.

Thank you all for your concern, your advice, and your upvotes. I hope that if any of you face a similar situation, that reading this can help you figure out how to resolve it.

I am afraid for my life and those of my children.,"My husband is active duty Navy. We have been married 11 years and have three boys together, ages 5, 2, and 2 months old.

He's always been verbally and emotionally abusive to me but lately it's escalated. In December he got mad out of nowhere while driving and began driving erratically. I thought we were going to crash. He pounded the steering wheel and broke the blinker handle thing off. When we got home he screamed at our 5 year old and kicked a hole in our wall. He'd never done that before. The next day I faked a pregnancy issue and had him take me to the hospital. I told my midwife what happened and asked for a social worker. CPS was called and investigated about two weeks right around Christmas. They closed the case despite me telling them that he'd said he would rather we all be dead than I leave him again. (We were separated for Sox months over a year ago.) They said he wasn't an immediate danger after speaking to our five year old and him having told them he was afraid of his dad. Since the case has closed my husband's behavior has not improved. I caught him pushing my two year old over on the sidewalk after he ran off. He grabbed my five year olds arm and shook it when he wouldn't drop his DS and left bruises. He has screamed at all of us and hinted that he would not let me leave alive.

We just moved into a new apartment and now he is underway until next week. I feel like this is a good time to do something but am scared of reporting him since nothing happened last time and because of the murder/suicide hints.

The only family I have is in Hawaii. We are in California. He has told me he will say I'm kidnapping of I try to go back with the kids.

I have no other family or friends

I have money set aside in cash, but no access to his income and he took me off our joint account last year.

When we were separated last year it was from an infidelity issue and I had found pictures of him naked under a tree by a park Inside our military housing. I don't know who took the pictures but I sent then to his command thinking they'd force him to get counseling. Instead they told him I was causing his career trouble. They didn't help us get access to income either and ultimately I came back last March because we were about to be homeless. I then got pregnant.

Can my roommate really just shoot my dog to death and get away with it? I've raised her from the day she was born. She was a part of my family. I can't stop crying, and it just seems like there's nothing I can do. ",legaladvice
I cut a tree down on my own property to save my house. My neighbor says he is suing,"I can't find any legal precedent for this. I knew where the property stakes were and the 3 trees that were in various states of decay were 3,6 and 20 ft on my side of the property line indicated by both satelite, gps and the actual property stakes. My neighbor - a litigator and attorney demands compensation for his trees. He then commissioned a survey that identified other stakes and the rest of the boundaries. The trees were actually further into my property. He accosted my wife at the mailbox saying we had no right to take his trees and they are on his property. He now wants me to pay for his survey, a new fence and ""his trees"".  Should I be overly concerned about how this would play out in court. All 3 trees were leaning over my house in excess of 60-100 ft. All were dead with one in an advanced state of decay. When the tree company removed them I specifically had them left on my property in view in the event that something like this happened because my neighbor is a known to be against tree removal and cutting. So to reiterate. Trees are well within my property confirmed by ""common sense"" and an actual survey paid for by my neighbor in an attempt to claim ownership of them. Trees are dead and dangerous - considered a hazard by my insurance company . I paid a significant amount of money to remove them. My neighbor says he is going to file a lawsuit over it.",legaladvice

Dying of a mysterious lung disease; military hospital is putting me on months-long waiting lists just to see my PCM for referrals and preventing me from going to civilian doctors.,"Title is TL;DR.

Went on a deployment to Guam and contracted something that's killed my pulmonary health: It hurts to breathe, I occasionally cough up blood either after waking up or exercising, I can't even go up a flight of stairs or walk for more than 20 minutes without turning into a dying fish gulping air. I was given an albuterol inhaler and that's it medication-wise.

Was screened for cancer and TB, both results came back negative, was unable  to get further testing done in Guam due to lack of accommodations at their hospital, am currently back in mainland US but the Navy's making it a fight to even see my primary doctor just to *get a referral* to see a cardiologist, radiologist and pulmonologist for follow-up testing. 

Every day I'm getting worse and I've been told I'm straight-up not allowed to go to a hospital or doctor outside of the military to get help, lest I face punitive measures in addition to having to pay out of pocket. 

What can I do? Who can I talk to? I've basically been told: unless you're actually on your deathbed, you're screwed. I'm trapped in endless diagnostics, recieving no actual care, operating at the speed of bureaucracy and I'm slowly dying.

EDIT: Went to the ER, complained  about the chest pain, worked like a charm. I've got a follow up appointment tomorrow and got all the referrals needed to book appointments at all the specialty clinics.

EDIT 2: I appreciate all the advice and good will. 

For the guys PMing medical advice: it's not pneumonia or bronchitis or anything acute: was screened for those as well, symptoms have been ongoing for almost a year now from onset of symptoms. It's also only a *little* blood, like  the amount you'd get from a paper cut. Still sucks and it's pretty alarming when it happens.

EDIT 3: Didn't expect the post to blow up like it did; I appreciate the support guys.

Given the sheer amount of people recommending the same thing, I'll address it here instead of individually: 

I'll be following up with either patient advocacy services for further appointments and bring up the difficulty I've been having with my CoC.

I'll bring up parasites as a potential source of my issues given the symptoms I posted, symptoms I didn't mention, vectors for infection (I had a LOT of sashimi/sushi there) and lack of key symptoms of other 'common' lung diseases were a near perfect match. Should be as simple as a sputum/stool sample and bloodwork for the yea or nay on that. I'll see you dudes on season 7 of *Monsters Inside Me*.

[UPDATE] My room mate is accusing me of grand larceny. I've been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street. NYC.,"First and foremost, I just want to say thank you for the support and the advice given to me. I did not expect such a huge amount of outreach. 

When I posted yesterday, it was just a jumble of words that I put together without putting in much thought because well I just got a phone call telling me all my things were being thrown out the window and I pretty much panicked.  

For some context, I've been living in the same apartment complex for about four years. I'm very well acquainted with the neighbors, security, superintendent and so on. So while I was away on vacation, when the accusation happened my room mate went around the complex to anyone who would listen that I stole $3700, I'm wanted for arrest and there's a restraining order refraining me from even coming onto the premises. This is how I was able to get the information through word of mouth. 

So from all the advice that I was given.. I decided to check on this RO and couldn't find it at all in the system. Turns out my room mate merely just filed a police report and none of the things I was hearing was true. 

So I got to my apartment complex and a lot of my things were in garbage bags and was thrown out of the window. My things were everywhere. So I called the police. I let them know the situation and they came into the apartment with me along with my landlord.

My room was indeed broken into and trashed. Many of my valuables such as my laptop, some sentimental jewelry that was given to me, shoes, etc were all missing. I was devastated. I filed a police report with the officers and stated everything that was missing and took a lot of pictures and videos like many of you stated.

During all this my room mate was there and it also looked as if other people started living there too. Turns out my room mate is using this situation to now squat on the property, not pay rent and also brought other people and friends to live there as well? Unfortunately because of this, there was no arrests even though all my valuables were missing and half my things were scattered across the street. The police said that because there is so many people coming in and out of my apartment and no witnesses they were not able to arrest anyone. I was advised that this was a matter of civil (I think) court and I would have to settle this there. They also advised me that I could stay here BUT they believe that it wasn't in my best interest or my safety to stay since he seemed violent and will be squatting on the property anyway which can take months to evict. So they escorted me into my room to collect whatever else I had left and I am now still staying with my friend. 

As for my lease, my landlord is understanding and feels sorry for everything's that happened. We're mutually agreeing to end the lease without any problems. 

I don't really have a place to call home now and I pretty much have to start over since I was only able to grab clothes. Even if I did end up grabbing all my things, I wouldn't have anywhere to put it. In hindsight, I feel foolish for being tricked. I guess this is a do over but thanks to all of you, at least I know the next steps to take and have some understanding of what to do and I find comfort in that. Again, thank you.",legaladvice
[OH] Sister stole ~$4500 necklace and pawned it for $50,"First, I'm writing this for my friend since she doesn't have an account.

Her sister stole a ~$4500 necklace (that was given to her by her deceased uncle) from her dads house and sold it to a pawn shop for $50.  We don't know exactly when (her sister claims it was months ago), but my friend got [this](https://imgur.com/a/BfmkWyJ) in the mail.  There was a receipt included and the pawn shop should have her ID on record.  Also, her mom and her sister have basically admitted to all of this in text messages and claim they're going to get the necklace back ""eventually""

So, obviously she wants to go get the necklace back herself (since it's unlikely that her mom is going to do it) and file a police report.  How exactly should we go about this?  My plan is to go to the pawn shop, see what info they can give us, then go file the police report, then go BACK to the pawn shop and ask how we can get the necklace back.  We would prefer to not have to pay for the necklace, so could we pay for it and then have her mom pay us back?  Also, what is likely to happen to her sister?

This is honestly a really upsetting time for her and her family, and the top priority is getting the necklace back and I personally would like her sister to face consequences for her actions since this isn't the first time (and probably won't be the last time) she's stolen from family.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: well I went to work and missed all the action before the post got locked so a few things:
1) thank you all for the advice
2) I got downvoted a lot for saying we were waiting until Monday, and even got a few messages telling me we obviously didn't care that much - we physically *can't* go until then, we both have jobs and other life circumstances (and honestly, that's really personal and I don't think I need to explain why). I understand it's not ideal but hey, that's life. Please stop yelling at me about it. 
3) the notice was on a postcard - no mail was opened

"New Roomate is actually a family and has taken over our apartment, eating my food, dictating what i can and can't do, now they are being openly hostile towards me and i can't take this. LL won't let me out of the lease, police say it is a civil issue.","I am renting a room in Toronto for university, the apartment is shared between 3 of us, i have a lease for my room and nothing else. I moved into this place in January, and up until May it was just me and the other roommate. In April LL told us a couple (not 1 person) would be moving into the empty room. I was fine with it because i didn't care that much.

When they moved in it became instantly apparent it was not just a couple, it was a couple, 2 kids, and another man. We immediately told our landlord, and the couple would keep re-iterating they are allowed to have guests. Landlord has told them no they cannot do this as it is not safe as the unit is overcapacity, but they just have ignored him.

Those guests have now been here for over a month, our landlord is trying to evict them through the LTB. But it has left me and my roomate in an extremely shitty situation. On top of this our landlord has basically told us if he lets us ether of us out of the lease then the family will completely take over the entire apartment, and he won't be able to re-rent it.

The family eats my food, i can't leave anything outside of my locked room. Last week the father and mother got into a huge screaming argument (that i cannot understand) which led to a domestic abuse incident which terrified me, my roommate called the police and the father was removed. He came back the next day and they have been arguing and screaming every other night.

Last night i invited a friend back to my place only for the father to start screaming at me accusing me of basically being a whore and then trying forcibly force my friend out of the apartment before i called the police. The police came i explained the situation, and after a bunch of back and forth he finally let my friend enter the apartment. I broke down when explaining the whole situation to the police officer, and while he empathized with me he told me it was a domestic issue.

I am sick of this, i want out now. My roommate's lease is up at the end of August but is planning to just move into her boyfriends and just eat the cost. I don't have that luxury unfortunately, and i am terrified of how this is going to go when she is gone.

How can i break my lease? What are the penalties for breaking my lease? I offered my landlord 2 months of rent (all i can afford) and he didn't take it.",legaladvice
I'm A Cleaning Lady Being Accused of Stealing in PA (contd FINAL),"To catch you up, in case you aren't following my story;
I clean for private residences in my local area. A year ago, a favorite client of mine's grandson ""Mark"", a 22 year old that lived with my client, accused me of stealing money from their home. $150 to be exact. I was eventually charged with theft, and facing up to 2 years in jail and huge fines!! I have a clean record, and it was his word against mine. So I fought it, and would not accept a plea bargain. For the last year, I've had to report to the court house monthly And sit in the courtroom next to dozens of others and reiterate that I would NOT accept a plea bargain. My public defender would really lay it on thick too. He would say things like, Sure it's awful to plead guilty to something you didnt do, but you know whats worse? Being in jail for something you didnt do. He would pressure me with the what-ifs of standing trial and the verdict is basically a coin flip. I was never so afraid in my life! But in life, you are given opportunities to either fight or surrender.. and even though the sacrifice here was my freedom, the alternative was my dignity. So we finally have a trial date set and about 2 days before I went in to pick my jury, my public defender calls me with news-The Prosecution is dropping the charges and making a motion to NULLIFY!! What?! I damn near fell backwards!! Gone. All that stress, all that needless anxiety..GONE! In hindsight, looking into the matter, many Prosecutors do NOT want to actually go to trial with most cases. They WANT you to plea out so it's over and done with. But I stood my ground, and in my case, it worked out to my advantage. I wish the rest of you the best, thanks for everything, special thanks goes to u/JustNilt for Being so helpful!",legaladvice
"[UPDATE] Purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. Now what? [NY, Putnam County]","I am gonna make up some names this time around because referring to people as ""the female seller"" or ""the tenant"" is cumbersome as hell.

After the mess on Wednesday, I met my realtor for dinner and to grab my closing docs. The seller's agent actually wound up stopping by as well (he arranged this with my guy) . He apologized profusely, told us he knows the family and he's confident we'll be able to get things sorted quickly. I didn't get my hopes up but he picked up our tab and bought a round of drinks while he was there, so hey, when life gives you lemons, make a superhuman amount of whiskey? I don't think that's accurate but it was my approach and I stand by it.

Anyway, I wound up speaking with the seller, Anne, yesterday morning, and got the rundown on the situation. It turns out the unwelcome tenant (Bill) is actually her nephew, not her ex's (Charlie). She was absolutely livid with Bill, and promised me the apartment would be vacant ASAP even if she had to physically drag him out herself and pay for movers to take all of his stuff. She also gave me assurances that she'd cover whatever this ordeal has cost. From there, she said she was going to check in with her sister (Diane) who was dealing with Bill as we spoke, and get back to me as soon as she knows something, but again promised that the absolute worst case scenario would be Bill starting to move out by early afternoon.

Maybe half an hour later she calls back and tells me that Diane had rented a truck and Bill was in the process of packing his stuff up. Turns out Bill had recently experienced something pretty fucking awful, and as a result had sort of become preoccupied with seeking approval from adult males. Charlie was at the top of this list; apparently his midlife crisis consisted of buying a Harley and trying to carry himself like a badass, and Bill bought the act hook, like and sinker. And a lot of you guys assumed correctly - Bill cooked up the scheme to basically extort me for a cash for keys deal. From what I was told, Charlie figured a doctor from NYC would just pay out right away to be done with it. For what it's worth, I am not an MD, nor am I from NYC... but you do you, Chuck. Anyway, at this point, Anne threw me a curveball. She and Diane were both at peace with the fact that I was going to pursue this with the police, but asked if I could meet Bill so he could look me in the eye to apologize because she wanted him get an understanding of the fact that his actions hurt a real, live human being. I agreed to it - I was hoping to see if I could get in to check the condition of the place anyway.

So yesterday evening I went up to the apartment and met ""my tenant"" as he was loading up the truck with his stuff. We wound up speaking for a while and... well, I am gonna disappoint some of you here. He seems like a genuinely good kid who got taken advantage of by a legitimate piece of garbage... there were a lot of tears, and innumerable apologies, and I 100% believe that these were based on genuine remorse for what he did, not regret about getting caught. I'll just say it here because I don't think I was being as slick as I'd hoped in dancing around it anyway, but the kid recently lost his father, and I don't see any reason to fuck up his life with a criminal record over a (ridiculously, incredibly) stupid mistake that he was to a great extent manipulated into making anyway. For whatever it's worth, if getting involved in a stupid scam like this was the worst thing that I did at nineteen... yeah let's just say that I was a remarkably stupid and reckless kid. I lucked out and never wound up getting caught in a situation that could have had significant legal consequences, but if I had and I hadn't been given a second chance, I'd be living a very different life right now.

As far as the money goes, Anne and I are going to figure out what's what, and I don't want to explain how because it involves details about her personal life, but the money will technically be coming out of Charlie's pocket anyway. She started by hiring some movers to unload my truck, which is taking place as I type this. Bill left the apartment in shockingly good condition, but I am basing that on what sort of damage nineteen year old me would have passively done to an apartment, so this may be a touch skewed haha. Either way, no damage has been done aside from some very minor cosmetic stuff (a couple of light scuffs from moving furniture and things like that), all of which would become immaterial when I redo the apartment in anticipation of renting it out, so I am not going to concern myself with any of that stuff.

As far as Charlie goes... well, I mentioned in a few comments that My Attorney (who is too majestically vicious for fake names so he just becomes capital-M-My capital-A-Attorney) is a super intense older guy and later found out is a ""retired"" civil litigator who can't sit still long enough to actually retire. Yeah he's out for fucking blood. Turns out Charlie does have himself some assets, and My Attorney is pretty confident that they will become my assets soon enough. I had a brief chat with one of the officers who came by on Wednesday (he's a friend of Diane's, apparently - this everyone knows everyone thing is still very foreign to me), and will be going by the station to issue a statement/file a report/whatever it is you do in this situation. Some of you expressed concerns that he may have fled the country, but the concept of Charlie leaving the county, let alone United States, is very funny to Anne, Diane and Officer Friend-of-Diane. Seems like Charlie is just a dumbshit who thought he could pull a fast one, and will be easy enough to find at one of the local watering holes when it's time for him to be picked up. I absolutely do not believe in throwing around assumptive diagnoses for fun, but I've made an exception in this case and decided that Charlie has full bore antisocial personality disorder because it makes me feel better about things for some reason. 

Anyway I have been typing this piecemeal throughout the afternoon which has essentially been a test of my wife's patience. I'm not dumb enough to incur the wrath of a tiny Puerto Rican woman who has spent the last couple of days stressed out of her mind, so I'm gonna call this a post. Thanks again to everyone on this sub for all of the advice given and sympathies expressed, I'm lucky as hell to have had this end the way it did.

Reporters are harassing us after a friend's tragic accident and posting inappropriate photos and quotes. What are our rights?,"I have a friend who was badly injured in a tragic accident. Somehow, the media was on the scene and took photos, splashing them over several outlets with a sensationalized title. They had been constantly harassing me, my family, her family, her friends, her coworkers, and her neighbors by calling daily. They camped out at the hospital grounds and followed us around, and some even snuck upstairs using our names, which is definitely illegal. We called the police and hospital security multiple times but by the time they got there, the reporters ran off.

It has been such a hard time for her and everyone close to her. The last thing we need is to be followed and harassed. Finally, after the 5th call, I asked the reporters to find it in their hearts to take down the photos of my friend that were partially exposing her private parts and injuries, so she can maintain her dignity. I also politely, but sternly, asked them to please stop calling everyone as we were still processing what happened. 

Of course, these ""reporters"" are the actual scum of the earth, devoid of a soul. The one I spoke with said they would remove the photos and stop calling. They did neither. The photos are still up months later and they called for another 2 days. I told them that I did not want anything I said to be published and that I am an anonymous friend. Instead, they made up quotes, saying that I said she was healing well when she was not. 

Even though I never game them my full name, they already had it and plastered it all over the article, including under a photo of her with another made-up quote. After it was published, I got 50+ calls and messages from acquaintances berating me for sending photos to the media, when I did no such thing. I was nowhere near the accident. That took another few days to clear up but I felt that was slanderous and purposefully misleading.

This happened in NYS. I have a very low opinion of reporters at the moment. They made my life and my friends' lives so much more difficult in an already difficult time, just to sell a sensationalized story. Do I have legal grounds to sue them for (1) harassing us (we have 2 official police reports with witnesses), (2) publishing nude photos without consent, and (3) misquoting under my full name without my permission?

*Edit to the 1st paragraph to make it more vague, as some have been able to deduce the story, which goes to show how widespread it was. Also, please do not PM requesting the full story.

"My immigrant, deaf father was choked, body-slammed, arrested and had his sentry card taken away at the border for failing to comply to an audible demand. I want a copy of the video and his sentry card back.","EDIT:
The title of this post inaccurately states my father was body-slammed. After a carefully talking to the family members present I realized this was not the case. The rest of this post remains unchanged.

A little background: 

My entire family and I are naturalized citizens from Mexico. We were all born and raised in Mexico and we tend to visit a lot of family and friends on an almost daily matter. We live in San Diego and in order to avoid hours of waiting at the border, we applied for and received [Sentry cards](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri/how-apply-sentri). We are hard-working people, engineers, educators, pay our taxes, etc...

My father was crossing back across the border into the US in one of the sentry lanes during labor day at around 7 PM. My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, and my pregnant sister-in-law and my niece were in the back of the car. According to the accounts of my family, there were two border patrol officers on the passenger side checking sentry cards before the actual booth. One of the officers made a hand signal in the shape of a license, implying that my dad flash the sentry cards, which he did - but the officer did not see it. The officer starts walking in front of the vehicle towards the driver side door while making the same motion and yelling something out which my father does not make out (he is deaf). He starts banging on the drivers side door. My father once again flashes the sentry cards and says ""Here it is!"". 

My family says that the officer did not like the tone my father was using and said ""OK. I'm gonna get your sentry card taken away"". My father opens the car door, confused and interpreting the banging on it as the officer asking to open it up. The officer then proceeds to choke my dad, drag him out of the car and handcuff him. My mother tried to explain that my father was deaf and wasn't understanding what the officer wanted. He replied with ""I don't care"".

Afterwards, my father was taken to a processing facility and released without any charges - except the officer was successful in taking his sentry card.

For obvious reasons this angers me - it really complicates our way of life here in a border city. I'd like to recover my dads sentry card.

I also would like to acquire video of the situation if possible. Border crossings are high-security environments and I know there must be video of the incident in possession by the BP officers. How would I go about getting video of the incident?",legaladvice
Employer forcing us to pay for parking that we don't use.,"My wife and I work for a hospital (Ontario, Canada) which has just implemented a policy that all staff will pay for a monthly parking pass at the main campus of the hospital. This will cost us approximately $1000 per year.

My wife and I both work off site, where parking is free. Also another couple that we know that works for the hospital only owns one car, yet both are expected to pay the monthly parking fee, and others we know walk or take the bus to work also have to pay for a monthly parking pass. 

This seems like robbery to me... It has nothing to do with standards of practice (like wearing scrubs), and driving is not an essential part of job duties for most at the hospital.

I am left freezing cold in my apartment - As I pay more than 4X the monthly hydro bill of my neighbor,"In June of this year I moved into a one bedroom apartment in Ontario, Canada. My hydro bills were exceptionally high since moving in (averaging $300-$400 CAD per month). *I am a student - and cannot afford these ridiculously high prices!*

* I am extremely cautious about using electricity because of these high bills, so I rarely use the stove, and I only use lights when necessary. In the summer I had an air conditioner plugged in, and i would unplug it when leaving the house. 
* In the fall month when I did not have any heater or air-conditioner on for the entire month of October and was away from the house for over a week, my hydro bill was still $320. 
* This winter I have a small infrared heater plugged in at the very minimal setting of 15°C in the living room. I have closed the doors to the bedroom and bathroom and sleep on the couch beside the heater, as temperatures are getting to be extreme. I turn the heater off when i leave the house for extended periods of time. I do not use the heating provided in the building because baseboard heating would be absurdly expensive. 

&#x200B;

I had made a few complaints to my landlord (whom i have a number of other problems with and currently have a work order issued for them for other unrelated issues in the unit). I have also called my hydro provider and they told me that my unit has had a long history of high electricity charges and all the past tenants have called complaining about it. At this point I just thought that it might just be normal in the area and that I should give up.

&#x200B;

The other day as I was leaving my unit I ran into my neighbor right across from me. He asked my how I was doing... and how my heating was (since it was so cold outside). Of course I broke out complaining about how high my bills were and how cold I am all the time.

&#x200B;

**He looked at me surprised. He told me his bills have always been around $40-70. He let me step into his house, it was so warm! The guy had a heater set so high, all the doors were open and now I am extremely confused.** 

**He let me take a photo of his last hydro bill (the one where it was fall and I paid $320).**

[**Table I made comparing my neighbors October bill to mine**](https://imgur.com/a/hGDRF74)

&#x200B;

After finding out about my neighbors bill I am convinced that something suspicious is going on. There are only 4 apartment units in the building as we are on top of a restaurant. The third neighbor has also mentioned that their bill never exceeds $80, the fourth I have not spoken to extensively on the matter.

&#x200B;

I called Hydro again and they told me they could have an inspector come and shut off the hydro to the unit to see if anyone else is connected to my hydro - such as the restaurant.

&#x200B;

I am feeling a bit helpless and would like to know if there is anything further that I should do. And if I do discover that my hydro is being bypassed, will I be able to get my money back for all these months (adding up to well over $1000 of extra payments)?

&#x200B;

If the inspector finds that nothing else is connected to me - what other possible explanation could there be?

Thanks for your help!

\- Wow, thank you everyone who has contributed in helping me to solve this mystery! Comments are locked and I've been receiving a number of helpful messages - even electricians willing to come by and check things out!

&#x200B;

\- Basically everyone has agreed that my monthly bill makes NO sense what so ever and that there MUST be an external factor at play (something is connected off of my meter) - at this point, it is just a matter of what that factor could be.

&#x200B;

\- Some people have suggested it is the downstairs restaurant, my neighboring units, the hallway lights/security cameras. Others have suggested it may be that hydro is not accurately reading the meter or the wiring is not properly set up. I have no access to the meter itself to run any of the  tests that you guys have suggested - So I unfortunately will need to rely on the landlord for that.

&#x200B;

\- Some of you have suggested that I look on my online account for usage since I do not have access to a meter- However, others have said that in my area data is not fed directly into the Hydro company in real time - and that looking online may not give me the answers I need.  I am still trying to access my online account to see what's going on - I tried to make an account and it says that my meter number and account number do not match up? Even though I used the numbers from the bill. So I still need to wait until tomorrow to sort that out. 

&#x200B;

\- When the inspector comes by I assume he will uncover the underlying cause- I should be getting a call tomorrow  (2018-11-26) to figure out when the inspector comes.

&#x200B;

\- Since a lot of you have shown interest in what is to come - I will make an update post as soon as the mystery is solved!

&#x200B;

\- If for whatever reason I don't get a reduced bill - some of you have suggested I apply for a government assistance program to help pay the bill  [https://ontarioelectricitysupport.ca](https://ontarioelectricitysupport.ca/)  (I hope it does not come to that though).",legaladvice
"UPDATE: My neighbors caused themselves to be landlocked, I posted here, it's resolved now","I posted here for advice a while back and received some excellent, some funny and some conflicting advice from all of you.  The overwhelming advice was to get a lawyer, which I did. I explained the situation and that I had posted here, as well as the many topics you all prompted me to read up on (which was very helpful).  While my lawyer seemed pleased with your advice to me, he also urged me to immediately stop publicly posting about the situation, which I did (and which I see from my many messages has disappointed all of you!)

First thing's first: everything worked out in my favor.

My wife was upset by the entire situation and especially concerned with our children, and she got involved as well.  She spoke with some friends who were able to get her in touch with the local city council. They could not explicitly do anything direct to help us but did get us in touch with some of the right people to discuss our situation.

One of the most important results from those connections was learning that the ""sheriff"" who we spoke to was actually a deputy who was acting on the sheriff's behalf. We were able to meet with the actual sheriff.  He did agree that we should be more open to compromise but was much more willing to admit that we had no immediate legal reason to do so, and no interest in forcing us to.

My lawyer made a key point of the fact (I use the term loosely) that if the neighbors require an easement to access their land, they should so so with the land they sold, and not with unrelated land. After a lot of back and forth (but no court proceedings, luckily) with the other party, their attention was refocused on the buyer of their land. Funny enough, it's a small world and I ended up meeting the buyer who was in my lawyer's office for a consultation with one of his partner's. He ended up needing to get a different lawyer (since I already had a lawyer from the firm, as I understand it) but we did keep in contact to some extent.

Now, some speculation: we believe that the reason the neighbors didn't bother us for a while was their finances; their lawyer was happy to keep pushing as long as he was getting paid, but when money ran dry he lost interest. 

Due (we believe) to those financial problems as well as their inability to find a quick solution, the neighbors ultimately moved into town and lived with family there for several months. The neighbor on the other side gave them one-time access with a moving truck. Their lawyer had been showing up with them but was gone at that time, which is another reason I suspect major money issues.

In the fall the situation picked up again, with contact from a new lawyer this time. This new lawyer requested a meeting with us (and our lawyer, of course). He requested that we consider buying their property to resolve the issue. We initially said no, they offered it to the owner on the other side, they said no, they sweetened the pot. Eventually the price was right and my wife and I had developed an interest in more land. We discussed terms, then decided against it, they went a little cheaper again, we purchased their land.

I nearly posted an update once the purchase was complete but there was an additional interesting detail that came out of the woodwork, and brought new legal questions. The neighbors had used their land and home as collateral for an informal loan and the person who lent to them wanted the property when they failed to repay him. He came after us.  The outcome of this was that they are the ones who failed their end of the contract, so his problem was with the neighbors, NOT with us.  This is definitely a sideline from the original situation but caused a delay in my ability to update.

As of today, my wife and I are out a substantial amount of money due to legal fees, which it turned out was not worth going after from the neighbors. There is also bad news in that the home on that property was essentially worth even less than we thought, and there were major issues beyond the land itself (septic tank failure, leaking oil tank).  Those expenses were slightly mitigated by insurance but we are out a good some.

We also had a hard time combining the plots, which was legally desirable to build anything that straddled the two property lines. However the plots are now combined into one large plot.

The good is that the neighbors are no longer an issue for us, and by this summer their property should be in good shape to use for a new project of our own. On one hand, I will say this: the little chunk of land was definitely not worth the time and stress involved in this process, nor the money. However, the outcome was positive for our family (for which there is no dollar value) and it's all over with now.

My sincere thanks to everyone who offered advice.  There are far too many of you to thank individually, but please know that I appreciated everyone's contributions and I hope you're all still around to read my much delayed resolution.",legaladvice
"Conceived a child through IVF with my spouse. DNA test shows he is not a match to either of us (Cross posted to r/advice). OHIO, USA","IMy spouse and I tired for 5 years to conceive a child. We were unsuccessful conceiving naturally. We were eventually successful on our 3rd IVF attempt. He is 14 months old now.

My biggest fear came true, that something went wrong. I don't know why I did it, but I performed a DNA paternity test on my baby. As it turns out my baby is not a match to either of us.

If I say something I could lose my baby. After our last transfer we should have had 1 embryo frozen still. So what happened to the embryo that was supposed to go in me? If my baby is not my baby then we should still have 2 frozen embryos. But I am afraid of losing my little guy.

I did more than one test. 3 actually. Same results.

What do I do?

"(AZ) Mom had a lung biopsy a few days ago, was surprisingly sent home yesterday after telling doctors she still had breathing difficulty - Hours after being home her lungs stopped working, had a heart attack and passed away.","I'm in Washington State and am still kind of in shock. From what my dad told me - Him and my mom were both surprised yesterday when the nurse came in and said she could go home.  I don't know the exact details of what happened but I know my dad expressed concern and was surprised they were releasing her. To make a long story short, hours after they got home she was laying in bed and my dad could hear her struggling to call for him. He called 911, by the time the medics arrived she was technically ""dead"" already, they did cpr in the house and on the way to the hospital. They managed to get a heartbeat but 35 minutes or so had passed already. A brain scan at the hospital showed lots of swelling and bleeding in the brain. She was placed on life support, but there wasn't anything they could do. From what I understand, her lungs stopped ""working/making oxygen"" which led to a heart attack. 

I'm crushed right now and still trying to process all of my emotions. It's just not sitting right with me that they released her that soon knowing that she was still having difficulty breathing etc after the lung biopsy.",legaladvice
Trespassers called police on me for brandishing a firearm.,"Yesterday around 530 AM I heard a tapping on my window. My window faces my fenced in backyard which has a wooded area behind me. At first I thought it was a lizard but it was more rhythmatic. I went to look outside and as soon as I opened the curtains I see a hand tapping on my window. 

I then turned on my light and started to tap the barrel of my shotgun against the window. The trespassers saw it and immediately darted away. I call the police and a few minutes later they show up and ask where is the person with the gun.

I told them I have a gun and explained someone was trying to break in. They said they were called because someone was brandishing a weapon from inside their house, but I called and reported a break in, not on myself. Apparently the person I pointed the gun at, called the police. 

When I explained the situation, the officer kept trying to finish my story by saying ""You were ABOUT to shoot him until he darted away"" and they filed their report and left.

When I spoke to my sister she explained that the police were trying to help me avoid a brandishing charge because if I can say I had intent to fire versus intimidate then I can't say I was brandishing. 

I had no intention of killing anyone. What should I do? I don't know if I am going to have to defend against a brandishing charge, what about the trespassers? Is it brandishing when I am in my own house?

"[Update] My dog got into a fight with a smaller dog. Owner asks for $1000 but won't show me vet bills. San Francisco, CA"," **Previous Post;**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0nqur/update\_my\_dog\_got\_into\_a\_fight\_with\_a\_smaller\_dog/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0nqur/update_my_dog_got_into_a_fight_with_a_smaller_dog/) 

&#x200B;

This happened couple of months ago and I forgot to update you guys. I guess, I just wanted to forget what happened.

Here is the rundown of what I did and what the outcome was.

&#x200B;

I started talking to my neighbors who know my dog and I asked all of them to write what they though about my dog, while being aware of the incident and thankfully every one wrote very nice things about my dog and us as owners.

We went to the hearing and there were many people there for their own dog related incidents. 

After signing up a police officer asked me and my girlfriend to have a word. I will not say who he was but he was basically aware of the situation and he thought that we should not be there. He assured us that we should be fine even before the hearing started.

There were couple incidents we heard prior to ours and they all were related to dogs biting humans. We were the only ones there over a dog fighting another dog.

They called the person who sued me on stand and that's when the show started. He did really put a show for everyone.

He mentioned that his dog was dead for minutes but he resuscitate his dog. He mentioned that there were blood everywhere. He started crying and sobbing. He actually said that he tried to pull his dog from my dog's mouth but he though his dogs skin was coming off. I know it sounds all bad but don't worry because none of this happened and his dog was fine. My dog did really bite him but it was a bark bite where he penetrated skin only and let go. He had pictures with him and he thought those pictures would help his argument but it really did not. It looked like the dog just got scratched.

Once he was done, it was our turn to speak. We kept it cool and explained what happened. We told the judge what we were doing to make sure this would never happen again. I also mentioned how he was asking for money and refusing to show me any bills. And that was it.. I called 3 weeks later and I was notified that our dog was not deemed danger to anyone.

&#x200B;

I know it's been a while and people who gave me opinions here most likely won't see it but I wanted to thank everyone.

&#x200B;

TL;DR My dog bit another dog over ball. It wasn't serious injury at all. Owner demanded 1k$ + more in time. I agreed but wanted to see bills and owner freaked out and sued us and tried to get my dog put down. He failed and my lovely boy is next to me now.",legaladvice
[GA] Got a VERY bad haircut at a well known salon. As my hair is directly tied to my income is it worth it to contact a lawyer?,"Right off the bat, I understand that other people have much bigger problems then this, and I know that hair grows back. Sorry if this post is all over the place. 

I know no one one Reddit can give me all the answers but I'm wondering if this is something worth pursuing or not. 

I also know that there are a ton of points where I should I should have said stop and asked for another stylist but I've never had a bad experience with these people and I'm kind of shy about speaking up. 

I had very long, healthy hair (down to my ass) that I've been growing out for 3+ years.  My hair is directly tied to my income, I'm a (hair) model and I'd say I'm probably looking at losing about $5-10,000 depending on what gigs I can still do with extensions (these are jobs booked specifically because of my hair up until the end of this year as well as paid social media advertisements). This isn't including income I would have made booking other gigs for the rest of the year (I made $30,000 last year in mostly jobs tied directly to my hair). 

A week ago, I went into a well known and reputable salon for a 2-3 inch TRIM. This isn't a Great Clips or Sports Clips type situation, this is a well known, expensive salon. The amount I wanted off was specified both when I made the appointment, in the notes at the front desk, and when the stylist was cutting my hair. 

I have a normal go-to stylist there but on the day of my appointment she was out sick. I was assigned a new stylist instead (I wasn't notified at the time that they were brand new to the salon and this was their first job out of school). Everything went well with the cut, but after they finished blow drying I noticed it was uneven (like a two or three inch difference). I pointed it out and they immediately apologized and went to fix it (first red flag, should have asked for someone else). At this point I was angled away from the mirror. Halfway through they went to ask the manager a question which I now realize was related to the cut and not just a general question (second red flag). I looked in the mirror and my hair was at least 5 inches off (probably more) at this point. This was probably when I really should have stopped them, but once again I had faith in the salon and five inches wasn't a huge deal because my hair was so long. When they came back I specifically asked NO shorter and just keeping it as long as possible at that point. 

I was facing the mirror and they were working on the back and I just hear her mutter ""crap"" under her breath. I immediately told her to stop and show me the back. I have NO clue for the life of me how but a large chunk of my hair was chopped to the base of my NECK. I asked to speak to a a manager and I was in tears at this point. 

The manager was really kind and explained she was new. But when I started crying she was rather rude saying ""it's JUST hair it will grow back, you don't need to be making a scene"" things along that line. I was really panicked at this point. She offered to have their senior master stylist come in to fix it the next day but I wanted nothing to do with her at that point, asked for a hair tie and left. 

The next day I went to my moms hairstylist who cut my hair when I was younger and he was shocked. He said that in his experience a salon of that caliber shouldn't have someone who would eff up that bad and he'd ask around. He also mentioned the possibility of me trying to sue that salon. I just wanted him to fix it and he did a fairly good jo by cutting my hair into a v-shape, but it would  be considered a long bob and in no way the style I have bookings for or the style that gets me jobs generally.  

Then today my moms stylist called me back (he's been doing my families hair for years and is a good friend) and said he had heard from a pretty reputable source that the stylist was the child of either the general manager or owner of that salon and wasn't qualified to work there. He said I should most definitely pursue legal action and that if this had happened in his salon the owner would already be making me offers. 

The original salon has not called me back at all, but I was fairly rude leaving. 

Question is, is this worth pursuing? I feel like any lawyer will laugh at me because it's just hair. I'm also really young and still working on my undergrad so this isn't a full time career. I just don't know what to do at this point.",legaladvice

2nd time in two months that the same Las Vegas hotel has served me (3 years sober and not ID'd) booze when I ordered a soda,"Third update: I don't think anyone will see this anymore though. I posted my experience on my Facebook and it's been shared quite a few times. CNN called me today. A few attorneys have reached out urging me to pursue a case. I really don't know what to do.

Second update; I met with the manager today and he said he will do anything to make this up to us and keep it from being talked about outside of the hotel. Whatever that means. I just thanked him and told him I'd call if I need anything. Thank you everyone for al your replies. It's not the end of the world, just extremely dangerous and negligent on their part. I spent most of the night crying thinking what happens now, do I relapse, but luckily I woke up feeling normal and just as committed to my sobriety as I was before that gulp... his comments make me think he or the boys are afraid of something happening. I don't know what, but if there is something more I can do to ensure this doesn't happen to anyone again I want to do it, like contacting the departments you guys have provided in the comments. Thank you again.

The first time, I messaged their security and got an extremely apologetic phone call with an invite to come back for a few nights and a comped several hundred dollar dinner in one of their restaurants. MORE THAN KIND, right? He said they could get in a lot of trouble for this, so they wanted to make it up to me.

It's night 2 of my stay here and I ask a waitress for a sprite with mint and lime, I was clear I didn't want a Virgin mojito just in case that was too confusing for the bartender.. a few minutes pass.. She gives it to me, and like an idiot, I take a big gulp. Yup. That's right. Going on 4 years sober and I just swallowed my second gulp of booze, thanks to the same hotels inability to idk, make a soda?

What do I do? I had to unfortunately go through weeks of counseling after the last mistake. I just feel absolutely let down and disgusted with myself and whatever bartender made my sprite..


Update; the head of the alcoholic beverage department called the manger on staff back, which is surprising because it's midnight. He said he'd appreciate if we don't go home, as he will come in the morning to speak to us because he feels this has escalated to a dangerous situation for both the hotel and me. I have no clue what that means but I'm assuming the video they found of them pouring booze into my cup, then the video of the waitress clearly telling me my drink was Virgin has something to do with it, or the fact that this mistake is the exact reason they even invited me back..... who fucking knows. They just had me fill out a statement. I have the drink here in the room with me. Idk why. I just need to sleep, I've been crying on and off for hours because yet again I'm left wondering if 3 years and change of sobriety is now down the drain.... and I need to to forget the taste of that strong ass drink going down my stupid ass throat.",legaladvice
"Ex-landlord trying to move people into our old apartment while we're still paying rent on it, and keep our deposit","I live in Denver, CO for reference.

&#x200B;

My wife and I recently signed a lease on a new apartment. We have paid rent on the old apartment up until January 31st so we are not fully moved out yet. We still have some belongings at the old place and haven't finished cleaning it. Our lease ends on Feb 1st. We told our landowner we would be moving around January 8th, so that he would have time to find a new tenant. I already told him that if he wanted someone to move in before the end of January he would have to give us the pro-rata rent for the rest of the month, and give us enough notice to fully move out, and he agreed. I just got a voicemail from him telling me he has someone moving into our old place in THREE HOURS and that they're not refunding our deposit because the blinds are dirty and the garden needs weeding (both things we were going to do before the end of the month of course). Our deposit was $1200. To really rub salt in the wound, the place was a shitheap when we moved in and we made many improvements to it at our own cost, such as fixing broken windows, repainting dirty walls, replacing broken fixtures etc. We have lived there for 2 years and he has consistently told us what excellent tenants we are and how much he appreciates the care we take of the property.

Got robbed at Walmart by someone who I think is my coworker but management says it isn't and implied my job is in jeopardy,"Posted this on /r/walmart and was suggested to put it here as well.  

Tried posting as a throwaway but guess it was too new, and wouldn't show up. This is a side account I randomly created years ago.

I am an autistic special needs janitor at a wal mart in PA.   
The other day as I was going to my car (I was off) just buying some food. A coworker calls me by my name outside the front doors. He starts talking to me and walks to my car with me. He said he wants to ask me a question and opens my car and gets in.

At this point he starts freaking out that he needs money and makes me give him all the money in my wallet, and then tried to get me to drive to a gas station to use my debit card. Now I am tiny, autistic, with bad motor skills from a head injury. He is the 2nd biggest person that works in the store. I would of been no match if he tried anything.

In the car he demanded my phone number so he contact me later. He called the number I gave to make sure it was the correct number. Thus me at this point acquiring his number.

The next day before work I receive 5 missed calls in a half hour from his number, telling me to meet him in private. I go file a report with the police and give them all the info, investigator said he would call the number I gave him to get him to stop harassing me as well.

When I got to work I file a report with management with the same info and they promise they would investigate ASAP!

Fast forward the investigator gets back to me and said a girl picked up the phone and he asked to speak my coworker and they said okay and put him on the phone. He responded to all the cops questions as the name I gave admitting he took the money but would give it back. The investigator also tells me no charges can be filed cause I handed the money over in fear and not it being snatched out of my own hands. I have been advised to appeal that to the state police btw.

Management talked to me today and an assistant who is not AP said he did the investigation and determined it was not who I said it but someone who looked exactly almost 100% like the person who I accused. Who happened to know my name, and who happened to respond to my coworkers name. They wont show me the footage. Also they casually decided to inform me I got followed by a car he got in after he got out of my car.

Now the manager is implying my job could be in jeopardy for wrongly accusing a person who even he said looked exactly like the person I said it was

How do I help my underage cousin get an abortion in Mississippi? Update: it's done. Thanks /r/legaladvice,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ze596/how_do_i_help_my_underage_cousin_get_an_abortion/

I'd like to thank you for your excellent advice which allowed us to help our cousin.

A few days after my post we asked her parents to allow her to come with me and my brother to DC as a cousin bonding trip. They were open to it and even ended up paying for her ticket and driving all of us to the airport.

We took mandatory pictures at all the usual places to make it seem genuine and then went onto the abortion clinic which we had previously booked an appointment. Everything went smoothly and the abortion was performed. The next day our cousin wasn't feeling well but we had a day for her to rest before coming back so it was fine. We paid for the abortion ourselves although her parents giving us money to spend for this trip helped cover most of the cost anyway as we didn't really do anything else so we didn't need much money.

Thanks again. Now that it's over and the abortion is behind her and she's recovered I've had a chat with her about birth control and we're making sure this doesn't happen again (unless she herself wants to get pregnant, of course!). She has also dumped her boyfriend who completely ghosted her ever since hearing she's pregnant.",legaladvice

"[NYC] We made a child protective services report on another tenant in our building, and now they and their extended family (who rent multiple units) are acting menacing towards us. We had to get a police escort out of our apartment this morning. What rights/recourse do we have?","Around 2 this morning, we heard the babies crying across the hall and the parents shouting at them and what sounded like them being hit through our vents. We called the police, and they said they'd send ACS within 24 hours. They showed up around 5 am, buzzing our apartment to be let in, and came up to talk to my wife (who made the call), and then they started speaking with other apartments and the one across the hall that we reported. Many of the apartments are rented by the same extended family (at least 3 out of 8 but I think more than that), so they all found out, of course, and when we were getting ready to leave, they were all out screaming in the hall. My wife called a police escort to get her out of the building, and even they were flustered, and said that we should call them whenever we're entering or leaving. Clearly, this isn't sustainable. This is a family that has had the cops called before for domestic disputes (one of the men was choking one of the women out in front of the building one night) and for quality of life reports (smoking in the building, loud parties on weeknights that go to the early morning, etc.), and apparently they've been in the building for a few decades.

We signed our year sublease beginning October 1st, so we obviously need to break our lease early. My wife got a hotel for the time being, and is afraid to return to the building, but I'll still need to return to pack everything and get it moved. Do we have a right to get our security deposit back? Are there any other steps we should take?

One of my coworkers was commenting on it all today after seeing me eat my sad work dinner, and said outright that it isn't the end of the world if I eat the stuff I'm not supposed to because ""a lightning bolt won't come from heaven and kill you"". I sort of gave her a look and she laughed and said it didn't when I ate the pie and told me what was in it. I'm so so upset right now. I genuinely don't know what to do or say. They've ignored my wishes and been outright hostile before but never like this. I went home crying last week over something else and filed with HR over it but they didn't take it seriously and this is just my breaking point. I'm not coming back after I have this baby but is there something I can do legally? TL;DR- Coworkers put something I don't eat into food and lied about it to me, saying they specifically made it safe for me. Now they told me they did it to prove a point. Do I have legal recourse?

"Witnessed car crash one month ago during honeymoon in FL, stayed around to give report to responding officer. Live in MA and just received subpoena to appear in court in August.","It was the first day of our honeymoon in Florida when we witnessed a car crash. My first instinct was to check the traffic lights at the moment of the crash so I could clearly tell who was at fault. My wife and I hung around the scene of the accident (no serious injuries thankfully) and gave our report to the traffic officer who responded. We felt good about ourselves for sticking around and doing our civic duty and figured that was that. 

Today, over a month later, we both received subpoenas in the mail to appear in court in mid August. The court is located in Florida but we live in Massachusetts. We are also both starting new jobs in the first week of August. 

I would REALLY not like to have to fly down to Florida on my own dime to testify, do I have any other options? Are any of the parties involved compelled to reimburse me for my travel expenses? Or am I SOL and should I just look for the cheapest flight down there ASAP? I'm feeling like that whole ""no good deed goes unpunished"" saying has never been truer. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this!",legaladvice
"[Update] [Virginia] - I caused an accident, lady I hit refuses to take payout from Insurance, thinks I should pay because I need to ""learn my lesson""","Original thread here - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/612803/richmond_va_i_caused_an_accident_a_year_and_a/

The lady I hit, for several weeks, refused to take the (verbally) agreed upon settlement and my insurance company put it on the back burner. In June they gave her 30 days to respond or they would rescind the offer. 

In the middle of June she hired a lawyer not connected to her insurance, rather a personal injury atty. I got a letter from the law firm telling me that I was going to be sued if I did not compensate their client the $40,000 she thinks she's owed from the car accident.

I kicked the letter off to my insurance company; I first called then emailed it: My adjuster that I was working with had an audible ""siggggghhhhh..."" after I read him the letter. Then a strained chuckle. ""We will take care of this.""

I heard back from them on Wed the 5th - They sent all documentation of the accident, the audio recording of her verbally agreeing to the settlement amount, and her ""manifesto"" to her newly hired atty. They apparently also included a note that stated that they were giving her until the end of June to accept the money or they would rescind the offer if she did not get this taken care of soon. 

My adjuster called me this morning to tell me that the issue has been resolved. She has signed an agreement yesterday that she cannot sue if she takes the money. According to my adjuster, they re-offered her the $40,000 because of two things: Primarily they wanted this to just go away and they did not want to be sued for more, second they apparently know of this personal injury atty, he requires a VERY high contingency percentage and this woman essentially played herself by hiring someone that was not necessary. He collected on her behalf and took his cut.

That's all I know, so yeah. Issue resolved and my insurance has jumped up a small bit in cost due to the accident. ",legaladvice
Working forcing me to give them (not donate) my blood (Pennsylvania),"Hello legaladvice

I know the answer to ""can my work fire me for....."" is almost always yes in the U.S., but this seems really wrong.

&#x200B;

I'm a phlebotomist in a hospital in Pennsylvania. I report to the laboratory supervisor. Recently I had to have some tests done. We are given a discount for having things that like done in our own hospital so of course I did. For medical privacy, I'd prefer not to go into what exactly, but it turned out I have something rare about my blood. I never told anyone this at work, but everyone found out anyway. My supervisor approached me excitedly, saying that they have to calibrate some kind of analyzer pretty frequently and that my blood worked as a positive control to save on some expensive chemical they have to buy to normally calibrate it. I laughed this off thinking she used my blood once to calibrate her machine. It turns out she is expecting to take my blood on a regular basis (at least weekly is the impression I got) to calibrate this machine. When I told her I wasn't ok with that, she got upset and stormed off to her office. She called me in later and told me I would be saving the lab a ton of money if I did this. I once again told her no. Now she has started dropping hints that the lab is in financial trouble and cuts will have to be made. I asked around to other phlebotomists and she hasn't said anything to them about these cuts.

Biomother of my foster son wants to sue me for vaccinating (MD),"Hey all. This might come out jumbled since I just got an email about this and I'm very frazzled. I'm sorry if some of this doesn't make sense.

My wife and I (also a woman) are fostering a baby boy who is almost two. He was taken from his birth mother because of some child neglect and his mother went to jail. We have been fostering him for nearly six months and are planning on adopting him, unless his mother can make a bid for custody back. She currently doesn't have a steady job and her housing situation is iffy as best so I do not think that is likely. How biological father is unknown.

My son attends daycare and last month, caught pertussis (whooping cough). He was hospitalized for two days but he pulled through. We realized he had missed several vaccines, so after he recovered, we got him caught up.

Last week at visitation, the caseworker mentioned this to biomom who freaked out about poisoning her baby and giving her autism. He (caseworker) explained that this wasn't the case, and that we're trying to protect him from illness, especially at his daycare. She said we violated her religious rights. (Religion has never come up before.)

We kind of brushed it off because she is always exaggerating things to get her son back (which is expected). She's also complained that she didn't want her son raised by two women but there weren't other foster parents available at the time (according to the social worker). But today she emailed us that she has a lawyer and she will take us to court for damages to her son. He hasn't been damaged by the vaccines at all, beyond a basic booboo.

Can she really take us to court? Does she have a case? My wife said I'm overreacting and that the judge will throw it out, but I'm not so sure. What documents do I need to make my case?

Edit: thank you all for the advice! (My wife is now using it to say ""I told you so."") We emailed the caseworker but haven't heard anything yet; it's a Saturday though, so we'll probably hear from him on Monday or Tuesday. I'll let you know if anything changes.",legaladvice
Somebody stole my identity to pay for their entire pregnancy - FL,"While vacationing in Key West, FL in February 2018, I was robbed of a backpack containing (among other things) my passport, my California drivers license, and my health insurance cards. I reported it to the proper state and federal agencies, and was certainly pissed, but did not really dwell on it. 

About six months later I start getting collection notices for various healthcare facilities for obstetric services. So I call them up to dispute, right? Surely a mistake. But they have my health insurance info, a copy of my (stolen) drivers license. All of the health info is in my name. Apparently I'm now 4mos pregnant and have been going to every sonography clinic in the Gainesville area on sometimes a weekly basis, to get sonograms of my healthy baby girl. I'm disputing bills left right and sideways for months from hospitals, OBs, general practitioners, geneticists, sonography, even ERs, when I receive a whammy of a \~$15,000 bill for fucking labor and delivery, and a week long NICU stay for a baby girl. 

In reference to those who are owed money, either nobody is believing me that it's not me or nobody's wanting to actually deal with it. They keep telling me that I need to physically come meet with them, which is fair I suppose, but I live in California and I work, so it's not like I can just hop on over to a random part of Florida and tour a bunch of healthcare facilities. I have neither the money nor the vacation time for that. 

I reached out to the local police where I live, who are apparently unwilling to do anything but take a single report and then never follow up ever. I was unable to file a report in Florida, Key West citing the fact that they wouldn't take a report over the phone and Alachoca (sp?) citing the fact that it was ""a civil issue"". I reached out to my insurance company, and they dropped me citing fraud--I didn't think to reach out to them for quite some time, and apparently they were pissed about that. I have no idea if they're investigating anything on their end or not. I reached out to the credit bureaus and froze my credit, and let them know as well. 

At this point, I'm nearly 40k in debt from this garbage, my credit is in the toilet, I'm in debt and financially hurting myself from unrelated medical bills I now have to pay out of pocket. I'm losing my mind at this point and I don't know what to do.",legaladvice

UPDATE [CA] Parents took and sold my car and won't tell Me who to. What's the best step to take from now.,"Thanks for the replies when I [originally posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/77vzo6/ca_parents_took_and_sold_my_car_and_wont_tell_me/).

All I needed was a more with-it police officer. I went in person with all the documentation proving that my car is my vehicle and with my brother, and stated clearly that my car had been stolen and sold and we knew who did it. The officer I dealt with this time treated everything seriously and listened to us both.

I had my car back within two days. My parents had taken it and hadn't sold it like they claimed but were renting it to someone they knew. The car was retrieved from the rentee's house. I hadn't yet made a claim on it so it was returned to me the day after retrieval. My mother has been charged, and I've also been questioned about my parents drug use. I'm over the moon that what they did trying to rip me off has shone a light on more of their behavior. 

I'm still trying to gain clarity with my insurer about possible internal damage to the engine or transmission and having that thoroughly checked out, but that's beside the point.

As a bonus this was the last straw for my brother. He'd been still living under our parents thumb and this gave him enough reason to also cut them off and commit to acting against them. I have my car back and my brother back more than I did before.

[NY] I found out my parents have most-likely been stalking me. What do I do?,"I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbnnqn/someone_has_tried_to_impersonate_me_and_those/) yesterday asking for help because I thought someone who may want to hurt me may be impersonating me by sending messages to my contacts, interfering with my relationships, and causing trouble at work.

&#x200B;

After posting, I shared what happened to a small group of people, who started sleuthing through what-ifs. They thought that my ex-boyfriend may be behind the behavior and the app we found, but it didn't add up to me. They suggested that I look through old text messages to see if I could determine where I went that day (e.g., if I had met up with him and he had access to the phone). I used my Google Location data to find out where I was on the date and time of the app installation, and it turns out I was at my parents' house.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, most of these things make sense. My dad has a history of financial interference and abuse.  Three years ago, he opened a series of credit cards in my name, maxed them out, and refused to pay. He ruined my credit. My mother begged me not to go to the police, so I didn't. Instead, I paid them off and worked very hard to rebuild my credit. He promised to pay me back and has not paid a dime to this day. 

 My parents have both expressed discontent with me considering my former landlord ""family"". They were quite vocally upset when I broke from the shared family phone plan, and opened a new plan with two of my sisters. They blamed me for influencing those sisters (who are both adults) to move out on their own. They are very conservative Muslims who disagree with my lifestyle. I feel as if they tried to interfere so that I would have no one left, and have no choice but to come home to them, as moving home until I get married is something that they've begged me to do for years.

&#x200B;

What legal recourse should I take now? I instructed my sisters to also scan their phones. One of them found similar stalkerware, while the other did not. 

&#x200B;

We have younger siblings who still live at home, so my sisters are hesitant to do anything that may get my parents sent away/harm my younger siblings' relationship to our parents.

"[MA] Landlord wants to fine/evict me for having sex with my partner in my apartment. Cites ""illegal activity"". Does he technically have a case?","So, bit of a weird one, so please bear with me.

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.

The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.

Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.

Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.

He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further). 

I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?

I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.

I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.

Edit: Case was in Federal Court, Louisiana.


Edit 2: since the update threads are locked by default, I'm going to add here my advice for others in similar situations, since it appears to be a common question in the PMs I'm getting.


First: look really hard into getting a lawyer, even if only for initial settlement negotiations. A lawyer MAY get your case dismissed in the incipient phase. The initial month I used a lawyer gave me the general direction I followed after. It helped me discover some of the tools I needed to use later. Unfortunately, my former employer got stubborn and it became a pissing contest. 

Things I've learned and I recommend: Read (download) the Rules of civil procedure, and the local court rules. Do not let deadlines pass! Better file something incorrectly than not file, when an answer or action is expected of you. You will have the chance to fix errors later. Have a witness(es) willing to write a declaration stating that your version is correct. Use affidavits/declarations to get your evidence admitted. Also - read the Rules of evidence!

Submit subpoenas, and take depositions! This is what ultimately helped me!

Good luck, all! ",legaladvice
Hospital gave my Mom's jewelry to another patient.,"My mom, (84 y/o) recently suffered a stroke and was in ICU for 3 weeks. She went in wearing her wedding ring a diamond/24ct gold bracelet and other gold jewelry. (Approx $4000 worth of jewelry). The hospital staff gave my dad (86 y/o) a bag with her personal items in it. My dad suffers from dementia and is not fully mentally there. When one of my sister's took a look inside the bag, (which was a few days later), she noticed that there was a separate bag for the jewelry but this bag did not have my mom's name on it it had a different person's name on it and it was cheap costume jewelry. 

&#x200B;

We notified the hospital and gave them the jewelry that did not belong to my mom and asked what they were going to do about her jewelry. We were told that the only thing they can do is wait to see if the person it was given to returns it, if they do then the hospital will notify us, if not then they were not going to take any further action.

One option my mom can do is file a claim with her Home Owner's carrier, unfortunately she has jewelry limitation of $1000 and none of her jewelry was scheduled so she would be out the amount over the limit.

I always made my numbers. Was even one of the top ""receivers"" on the floor. I averaged 120-150ish scans a day, my error rate was very low maybe 3 ""tags""(errors) in total. because I wanted to prove my worth.

I signed the offer of employment and when they did the 2nd background check I received a call from the temp agency saying they were no longer going to hire me citing my record. Even though I was upfront with my record.

Do I have any kind of legs here? Or is this just what I should expect until I can get my record expunged? 

Kinda shitty man. This job was the best thing that happened to me... I was able to help my mom out and feel like a normal person of society. Idk. I don't want any boo hoo's for me. I know I'm a good person.

I felt wronged in this situation, dirty almost. I understand if I provided  them with reasons like being late, or not performing. But I knew I had something to prove and I did just that. Which is why they offered me the position.

I was in that warehouse for 3 months... There background check went back 7 years....

Sister opened a student loan under my name 8 years ago.,"Like the title says, my sister (2 years older than me) opened a student loan in my name 8 years ago, just after I turned 18.

The only reason I found out was because I got a letter a few months ago from the servicer who holds the loan giving me the amount of interest paid on it last year for taxes. I thought it was a mistake at first but when I told my mom about it in passing a couple of days ago, she said she thought my sister had paid off the student loan. 

Yesterday, I dug around a bit and found the letter, called the company, and found out I have about $15,000 more in debt to my name than I thought because of it. I'm going to be buying a house soon and I'd rather this just go away completely but the servicer insists I'm on the hook for it. For what it's worth, she's never missed a payment on it.

Edit: I'm in Wisconsin. To be clear, my parents didn't know about it and they are pretty pissed. My sister has a good job and I think she might be able to pay it all back in one go.

My old boss is hellbent on getting me fired from my new position,"**Cross post from r/relationships. They told me to come here for advice. It is a wall of text but I needed to make sure I had all the important information.**

Hey everyone first off let me say, throw away because a lot of people know my main account. Also, I apologize for the wall of text that is ahead.

Forgot TL:DR

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

So 5 years ago I graduated college and was applying to PA programs. I unfortunately did not get in any programs that fall, so I decided to move to a big city on the west coast. I applied to more schools out west and didn't get in. I then decided my best bet was to get more patient care hours so I got a job in a hospital, it wasn't ideal because my degree unfortunately is meaningless without grad school.

The job I get was entry level but it paid well and I was able to start paying back student loans and learn about inner workings of hospitals and see different departments. I loved my job because I was able to interact with patients, nurses, doctors pretty much all hospital staff.

I was hired on the midnight shift and during my first year I asserted myself as a leader and someone you could depend on. I worked almost 3200 hours my first year as my department was always short staffed so overtime was easy to come by.

After my first year there I still wasn't accepted into any grad school programs. But a leadership position on afternoons opened up and I applied for it and was interviewed by a panel of managers, my manager and several others.

I and 6 others out of 24 were brought back for a second interview, this one didn't involve my manager. I was told by the panel the only reason I wasn't outright given the job is because my manager didn't believe I would do a good job and she seriously doubted my leadership skills.

I agreed that I wasn't the most assertive person, but I would do my best to lead by action and speak up when I needed to. The panel informed me that, my job wasn't to force others to work harder, that was my managers job to make sure everyone was pulling their weight.

After a few weeks I got a call and was told I got the promotion I to the lead position. A few people who had been there longer than me gave me trouble the first few weeks because, ""we have seniority"" I told my manager and she said she would handle it.

We had what I thought was a good relationship, but it quickly became apparent she would have rather had someone else in my position, someone who would follow her direction without question even if it compromised patient care or privacy.

About 6 months after I took my current position we had several employees switch departments or quit. I was working 7 days a week 12 hour shifts until they hired enough new people to fill our voids. This took around 4 months. At that time I was accepted into a local PA program and would start the following spring.

I continued working when school started but much less than what I was before because of school. During this time my relationship with my manager deteriorated even further and she made it clear she wanted me gone. The only thing was, her boss, the director of nursing ranted and raved about what a wonderful job I was doing and even though we were at 3/4 staff I was still able to manage all the work.

I finally graduated from my program 2 1/2 years after I started. At that point I needed a break from all work as I was work in 40 hours a week on top of 36 hours of interning/clinical work as well as studying. I requested all of my PTO to be used to go back home as I hadn't left to see my family in over 5 years. My PTO was approved by HR and I took off, I had 2 full months off.

During my time off I got a call from the Emergency Department, they really wanted me to come in and be a trauma PA, I was also called by our stroke unit where I did a vast majority of my internship and they were interested in me coming to them to work. I was ecstatic because both the Emergency Department and Stroke Unit were places I wanted to work. I talked it over with my family and decided to work for the Emergency Department.

I called my boss and told her that I was putting in my 2 weeks and since I had a month and a half left on my vacation I figured I would be fine starting in the ED when I returned. I told her I was offered a full time PA position and she seemed really excited for me. I notified the ED that I would be graciously accepting their offer, and that I could start as soon as I got back.

My friend who works in the department told me my boss was livid I was quitting but I didn't think much of it. I said it was too bad and people leave all the time when it is their turn to move on.

I left it at that, I was very ready to get back to the hospital and begin working. However, when I returned, i ram into a bunch of issues, firstly, HR did transfer me to the ED as a clinical staff member but didn't terminate my previous job title. My first day, my badge stopped working I couldn't use it to get into my work area, locker room, the building. I went into HR and they said my previous manager said I wasn't part of the company anymore and to terminate my badge access.

Odd but I told them I was now a PA in the ED and showed them my new credentials. They reluctantly allowed me access to my work areas.

The next week, I am pulled aside by my new boss. He asks me how everything is going and if I can swing by his office after my shift. I tell him yeah thinking it's going to be a check up on how the new job is going.

My shift ends and I go to my new bosses office. He asks me why he is hearing so many negative things about me. I ask him what he means and he tells me I have had 3 formal complaints filed against me. I ask him if I can see them and he pulls them up on his computer. The first one is about unprofesionalim in the workplace. I ask him who filed it and he said it would be better if he kept it anonymous because the second complaint was about workplace violence. The third complaint was a HIPPA violation claim.

I was taken aback because the first two complaints came from 2017, when I was in my original department. The third complaint was when I went to clean out my previous locker and I was verbatim, ""Throwaway was in a secure loaction where he sought out potential information about patients."" It was the break room that doubled as out locker room, I was only there for 5 minutes to clean out my locker.

I went to HR because all of these are serious allegations and they told me all 3 complaints were made by my former manager. I was upset that all this was happening and there is basically nothing I can do. HR conducted a formal investigation on me and found nothing to be out of place.

A few weeks later my new boss had a sit down with my previous manager where she told him, ""she will stop at nothing until I am fired."" And, ""He is the most lazy and unprofessional worker in this entire establishment.""

I went to HR to file a complaint about her and potential harassment. HR told me they are unable to file my complaint because I am under review for corrective action and a manager would never do anything like that so I should just drop it while I am ahead.

About a week later I passed my old manager and she called out me me and said, ""wow, I'm surprised you're still here, I wouldn't want a provider taking care of me with your reputation"" in a hallway in front of patients, nurses, doctors and visitors.

I tried to schedule a meeting with her to talk but she said there was ""nothing to talk about"" and my actions are ""reprehensible"" and soon enough I would be ""where I belong, out the doors""

I heard from my boss that she has been scheduling meetings with higher ups about me and my boss doesn't know if it is going to work if this ""drama"" continues.

I don't know what I should do because, I have done nothing but display the up most respect for her, she is just hellbent on ruining my career at the facility and any other place I try and move to. Is there any action I should be taking right now? I feel like I should retain a lawyer and send a cease and desist letter, because her actions and false claims could be damaging my future.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

Edit: for u/commonWerewolf

Firstly, my manager was well aware 2 1/2 years before I left that as soon as I was done with school I would be moving on fairly quickly. She was very supportive at that time and understood because there are a lot of college kids who work in the department while they are in school.

My last full year in school we (my manager, myself, the other afternoon leader, the 2 night time shift leaders and the weekend leaders) sat down to choose another lead. One of the night time people wanted my position which my manager agreed to. We also took applications from department workers to fill the now open night time lead position and filled it a full year before I would be done with school.

My 2 months were approved by HR and then by my manager, we have to have double approval. She said, this was wonderful because she could rotate her new crew in as I HAD been reeling back my duties. The new night time leader was originally on my shift and he had gradually been picking up my work per my managers request to train in the leadership role, which he's excelled at.

My manager knew I hadn't been home in almost 5 years and that I really needed a break because in those 5 years I had a full week off for sickness, and a handful of random days here and there. Most of the time I was at work, didn't have a social life, that's ok I was a grad student didn't really need one. I missed out on a lot of things because I was willing to put in 60+ hours a week.

When I went on my vacation I was not expecting to get a new position but my manager was aware that my application was out and that I could get a call that I could not turn down.

Also, when I did put in my 30 day notice, I did call and I talked with her. I told her I was more than willing to start my 30 days when I returned but was told we already have the replacements inline and that they are working out well so it wasn't necessary to delay my transfer.

I have done everything professionally and by the books. I always conducted myself in the most professional manner I could while improving patient care. We had replacements picked out a whole year before I left. The two who took over are both in school and will be there for an extended period of time because the department works incredibly well with school schedules, that is why I stayed so long.

And yes I said that to my friend because I genuinely didn't care at that point because I had multiple okays from my manager to transfer. So I wasn't so beat up about her being upset after I had the go ahead to leave.

Can my parents force a pregnancy test?,"My wife was sexually assaulted. She got pregnant, and the baby could be mine or the rapist's. We decided to keep the baby and raise it as mine. We never want to have a paternity test done on the baby because this could be devastating to her relationship with my wife.

I'm a massive moron, and after my daughter was born, I let slip to my parents that she might not be mine biologically. I tried to backtrack, but my parents kept pushing and pushing until my wife sat them down and explained the situation. They do not believe her. They think she cheated and that she is using me.

Now my parents have approached me about taking a paternity test. They want me to contest paternity and leave my wife. I do not want to. I made a commitment to my wife and daughter and I stand by it. I trust my wife, but my parents don't. They told me that if I refuse, they will go to court and compel me to do a paternity test to absolve me of responsibility for the baby. They want me to leave my wife regardless.

I am planning to cut contact with my parents over this, but is there any way that they can legitimately force me to do a paternity test? Is there something I can do to prevent this or fight them?

We are located in RI.

Update:https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9pvzr8/im_going_to_sound_like_a_busybody_but_am/,"https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9pvzr8/im_going_to_sound_like_a_busybody_but_am/


So, first, I didn't appreciate all of the nasty messages I got from people insulting me and berating me and saying that I was trying to ruin this family by calling CPS.  Yes, I'm well aware of the fact that some CPS workers have made poor decisions, but you're in idiot to not utilize it when it's appropriate. Along with those messages, I got quite a few from people saying they grew up in similar situations and had been indeed been molested and to please call and to put this in the hands of the authorities.  

I never personally thought that the girl was getting molested; I just wondered at what point this creepy emotional incest is deemed inappropriate. So I went ahead and called and when I said the woman's name, the worker said, ""Oh, she works at *****?"" So, she was already on the radar.  I told her what facts that I knew about that I thought were concerning.

Yesterday the coworker went on a rant about how she's being persecuted, that CPS is on her case again- again, after previous complaints about the child pooping repeatedly in the neighbor's yard when she was a toddler and something else about food stamp fraud getting her checked out by CPS a couple of years ago.  

There was a long convoluted conversation. I have to listen to this self-absorbed narcissist talk about herself endlessly and never say anything, just try to disengage as diplomatically as possible and get back to work.  But CPS wanted to see the girl's bedroom and they said she slept in the attic, which is a pull-down trap door. Which is never actually used and CPS was well aware of that. When the breast feeding topic came up, I was like Oh, she still breast feeds, huh? And get this, she said that at her age, she can no longer ""latch on"" and actually get milk out of the breast anyway. It's for bonding purposes. 

The bed thing......I thought it was super obvious before that they were having sex with her in the bed, which I personally find disgusting, but in the last post people seemed okey-dokey with it. So, I asked her, Isn't it hard to get any privacy for sex? You see, I'm not holistic and could not understand that it's a worldwide practice for parents to have sex in front of their children and it takes away their fear of death. Fucking gross. THREE HOURS LATER and she's still talking about all of this, well, more about how she's a martyr, and her mom brings the kid in after school. I turn to the kid and for the first time, got brave and said to the her, ""So what do you do at night when they're having sex?"" And she said, ""I pretend I'm sleeping!""  Both the grandma and mom were speechless, like maybe it dawned on them a little bit about how very bad that sounds.  

I'm not exactly sure how everything went down, but I do know that she's not being taken out of school, she was assessed and the professionals didn't think she was being molested (again, I didn't really think so but still thought this was inappropriate and not just a different form of parenting). They have to clean out one of the bedrooms that's a hoarding pit and provide her with her own bedroom. The girl's father was somehow in the loop and will be more active with her, since he's technically got half-time custody anyway. 

She said she's trying to have a second baby now anyway. And my favorite part, her sycophantic friends, even more poor than her, are doing fund raising on her behalf; for what or why, I do not know. 

For the people saying that they're going to figure out who I am here on Reddit, first of all, these people brag about not using social media, and second of all, they can kiss my ass; I'm leaving soon for nursing school WHERE I'M GOING TO VACCINATE ALL OF THE LITTLE CHILDREN!

Luckily there were witness who called the police and stuck around when they arrived. The woman was arrested for battery. The police said that I shouldn't worry since I acted in defense of myself and my son, they also made a note that she attempted to take him out of his carrier.

"UPDATE: Un-permitted contractor next door did $5,000+ of damage to my home, contractor and homeowner won't pay or provide insurance information","Hi r/legaladvice. Just wanted to provide a ""thank you"" for all of the responses and an update on the situation detailed in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atin99/unpermitted_contractor_next_door_did_5000_of/). Basically, I'm a homeowner in Philadelphia, PA, and a contractor working on my neighbor's house caused a leak that led to a lot of mold and water damage that needs to be repaired, and the contractor and homeowner have ghosted.

&#x200B;

Since so many people suggested we file a claim with our homeowner's insurance, I gave that a shot. However, according to the adjuster I spoke to about our claim, our policy apparently has an exclusion for ""faulty workmanship"". Even though it's completely insane, I was told that our insurance company would not cover the damage or provide any legal assistance because the damage was caused by someone doing work on the house next door. The adjuster told me this is a very common clause in insurance policies. Basically, all insurance companies are completely manned by psychopaths and capitalism is an endless nightmare that will surely swallow us all.

&#x200B;

So now it looks like I'm back to square one. The police have suggested that I try to find information about the contractor and homeowner through the Licensing and Inspection Department to pursue legal action, but previous attempts at that came up with basically zilch aside from a suggestion to hire a lawyer. So I guess I'll try and find a lawyer that will take this case, although my previous attempts to reach out to lawyers about this issue have not been promising at all.

&#x200B;

Going forward, are there any additional avenues I should pursue? My insurance company (Farmer's by the way. If you're thinking of going with them I might suggest drinking poison instead) is completely worthless. The two lawyers I've spoken to seem to have absolutely no interest in taking up a case, one of them specifically advised against hiring a lawyer because of the relatively low cost of the damage, the amount we'd owe in legal fees, and the fact that cases like this are rarely paid out even when they're successful.

[SC] RA keeps interrupting sex because I'm gay (update),"Hello again legal advice. This is a follow up to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9bfpx8/sc_ra_keeps_interrupting_sex_because_im_gay/

I've got good news: the RA has been removed! I went to the residence coordinator and he called someone above him in the housing department, who told us to write down every incident I remember for housing to review, then go to the title 9 coordinator. It took awhile to get through all the paperwork, but the process was a lot less intimidating than I thought it would be.

The RA was fired and given the option of either moving to an empty room in one of the old dorms or moving off campus within 30 days. He chose to move out and stay with his girlfriend after a week, which I didn't realize he had since I've seen other women come into his room but I don't feel like stirring that pot. After I made the report, he stopped banging on the door when my bf was over, but every time he saw me I could feel him staring daggers into me. He also started doing petty stuff like ""accidentally"" knocking my towel onto the floor of the shower room and leaving it there. He left me an apology letter at one point, but it was definitely not sincere. I could've moved to another dorm temporarily but decided it would be too much work because they gave him a 30 day deadline and he started packing the Tuesday after.

Yesterday the new RA finished moving in, and after talking to him about all that happened I think we're going to get along fine! :)

The residence coordinator said that housing had done all they could do, any further action would be done as a result of the title 9 complaint, which might take several months to complete. And for those wondering, yes it is a public college and there is no no-sex policy (I looked through the housing contract and couldn't find anything except rules against sexual assault and discrimination based on sexual orientation), I should've said that in the original post but it blew up and was locked by the time I saw those comments.

Took Husband To ER For Possible Stroke and He Got 5150/What Can I Do?,"This is a long story because a lot happened and is still happening.

We live in Seattle. My father in law died suddenly and we flew down to Northern CA to deal with that. We decided to drive back. On the way, my husband started to say that he didn't feel right. His heart was racing, his face felt weird. He was on little sleep dealing with his family and we hadn't been eating great because of everything going on so this man who is normally pretty chill got flat out terrified that he was having a stroke.

We work for a pretty big and well known non-profit health care provider that pushes the whole kind of better safe than sorry thing when it comes to your health so...I googled the closest ER and went to it.

We got there and, by this time, I'm pretty sure he's having a panic attack. He's not violent or threatening or anything, just really really scared he's about to die like his father to the point that he's making sure I know he doesn't want to be cremated.

I tell the check in person that he thinks he's having a stroke and I think it's a panic attack but I'm more worried about his heart. They check him in, he gets the code for the bathroom and goes to the bathroom. (In other words, he's not threatening anyone, he's not trying to kill himself, he's not unable to take care of himself.)

After he's available, the nurse takes him for triage. His blood pressure is 188/100, which is NOT normal for him. I tell the nurse this and that I'm very scared about what that means. She just shrugged it off. She asked him his height and weight and he answered. Then she started to ask him all these mental health questions. When she would, he would look at me because...what the hell does that have to do with anything right now? His blood pressure is not right.

So I answer these questions to the best of my ability while pointing out his physical symptoms were a very big concern.

They take us back to what they call their ER Overflow. It ends up being psych. My husband keeps asking why he's there. They take that as he's unaware of his surroundings. He does as they ask and changes and such because it was pretty clear they had no intention of letting us leave.

He's not put in a room, just a cot with a curtain in a line of cots with curtains. We look around and notice things like...their trash bins are just Lowe's Lawn and Leaf bags and they keep patient charts in three ring binders on a desk and they're accessible to anyone in the room.

Where we work, the standard is you secure everything in a computer and patient information is guarded like state secrets. When dealing with patients, our medical staff asks them multiple identifiers no matter how many conversations they've had with that person before new information or new medical stuff has to happen.

These people came up to my husband and just said his first name then started to talk to him like they'd been friends for years. He refused. He let them know we expect a certain level of patient safety and we're not getting it. If they don't ask him his last name and birthday every time, he's not talking to them.

They took that and wrote it down as, ""Paranoid.""

I explained to them the medical world we come from. They said it doesn't matter. They do things differently so the fact that he can't fall in line is an issue. They kept the ""Paranoid.""

Eventually, they got him a televisit with a psychiatrist but wouldn't tell us much about where this psychiatrist is based out of or anything. When he pops onto the screen, he just says his name and that's it. It looks like he's in his living room.

Again, this is NOT what we are used to.

The psychiatrist asks my husband his name and his date of birth. My husband refuses to answer. He didn't agree to this, he doesn't feel medically safe, he doesn't trust what's going on. The psychiatrist spends all of five minutes not really trying and calls it a day.

At this point, I'm not worried my husband is having a stroke, but I am worried his heart is going to explode because of how they are treating him and how they're not even touching on HIS concern that he's having a stroke. He started to beg me to not let them let him die. Then he started to try to go through at least the physical tests for signs of a stroke. The staff looked at him like he was this super sad insane guy and decided he needed Ativan. Because *I* was worried about his heart and I know the doctors I work with in my job prescribe it for some patients to feel ok with being in an MRI machine, I talked him into taking it in hopes that he would at least not care that he's so worried about having a stroke.

Eventually, we hear back that the psychiatrist on the TV who spent five minutes with my silent husband has decided he's bipolar, is having an episode, and needs a 24hour hold and anti-psychotic medication. 

What?!

So they start planning for him to be there for 24 hours.

I try to fight them, but they shut me down every step of the way.

Meanwhile, the Ativan is making my husband loopy. I look it up and...oh... it can cause hallucinations. Spiffy. This is going to help our case.

The night wears on and they try to get my husband to take Zyprexa. At this point, the Ativan is wearing off but he's ok. He asks them if there's side effects with Zyprexa. They laugh and shrug. All drugs have side effects according to the nurse. He declines to take it. They tell him they can't trust him to be released if he can't follow medical staff direction. He asks again if the medication is safe. They assure him it is. He reluctantly takes it.

A couple of months ago, his PCP back home prescribed him Prozac. Seattle gets funky around this time of year and, with him being from CA, the change in seasons can be hard. There's a lot of SAD in the area from the CA transplants. His doctor wanted to be proactive.

This hospital KNEW he was on Prozac.

They declined to tell us that Prozac and Zyprexa actually CAN interact.

And, of course, it did.

So now he's SUPER out of it, talking nonesense, suddenly becomes worried that he's peed himself. They try to take blood from him and his blood is so jacked they barely get anything. And everything just starts to to downhill from there. Eventually, they feel like I'm asking too many questions and being disruptive and kick me out then put him on a 5150 and he's been stuck there with no clear way out. I talked to the mental health person that put the 5150 in motion and she would not budge. She was adamant that my safety was in jeopardy. I told her I'm not scared of my husband and, that, once they stop giving him those meds, he won't have the symptoms he's having. She stated that she can't because of his paranoia that his identity is going to be stolen. I pointed to the OPEN BINDERS ON THE DESK of patient information and said, ""You're handing it out to people here. He's completely justified."" But they do it differently and, because he can't file in line with that, it's a really big issue. They had no intention of letting him go.

Keep in mind, too, they'd ask, ""You have XYZ insurance, right?"" before deciding what sorts of things they're going to throw at him. He has excellent insurance.

This is a small rundown of what I know has been done to my husband:

They have ""accidentally"" given him his Prozac prescription twice a day when he just takes a dose once a day. They keep giving him the Zyprexa on top of it and he keeps having side effects.

I have seen NO paperwork about anything happening to him. No consent forms. Nothing. When I asked for a copy of the 5150, first they couldn't find it then they said I need to ask Medical records. It's the weekend. This place is dead on the week outside of the ER. Not happening.

I got in contact with our home medical team. The doctor in charge of his care told our RN he's not talking to her and hung up. (Our RN is now working on putting him through the wringer.)

They refused to let me see him for an entire day. I'm going to try to see him today, but I'll probably get escorted out again. I'm walking a fine line of not getting out right banned from the hospital.

There is no patient advocate in staff, no ombudsman. No social worker.

All the lawyers in town take the weekend off so I can't get a lawyer. I talked to my police team back home because they're good people and they suggested I call the police here to do a wellfare  check. The police here wouldn't do it.

I brought my husband in for a stroke and now they're giving him meds he didn't really agree to take, his reaction to those meds are giving them a medical excuse to not release him, and no one here will help me.

What do I do? How do I get him out?

UPDATE
I'm getting a lot of the same responses about certain things so I'd like to add:

We work in health care. The place where we work requires at least two patient identifiers before we are even allowed to start talking to the patient. I get that it's probably not standard in most of the country, but our high level of care that receive from our company isn't either. We calmly explained why we balked. They couldn't humor him. The more zombie they make him the more his extensive training for his job makes him silent. Like we say, if we haven't pissed you off making sure you're you then we haven't done our job.

My husband has signed that I can know his medical stuff and make medical decisions on his behalf.

He thought he was having a stroke and no one was addressing those concerns so he was scared he might die from a stroke. I work with Neurology patients. His reaction was not inconsistent with my experience.

Part of our situation is stemming from we are used to X level of care and professionalism and, apparently, that's an anomaly. But, no, I'm not going to let him be penalized because he expects a certain standard that all people should expect. When we spoke to our personal medical staff about the reasonableness of him keeping quiet because they don't do what we do, they consistently say they wouldn't talk either because that's not safe.

There are ways for staff to validate the staff from other medical facilities.

We are working on getting a lawyer. I called them and they won't say anything past he's sleeping and that he's not allowed visitors.

UPDATE

They have *lost* the forms he signed giving me clearance to speak on his behalf and cut off communication.  His mother contacted them and they told her that he has been re-evaluated and his hold has been extended another 72 hours they state because he is unresponsive and suicidal. His first hold went into effect 12/7/2018 at 12:22PM.  Today is not 72 hours.  There was no hearing that we know of.  His mother got them to let me call them.  I called him.  He stated that he wants to live, but he needs help.  I asked him with what.  He stated that he's too weak to feed himself and get himself water and they won't help him with that and he feels like he's starving.  I did tell him to ask them so let's hope that happens.

Edit to add: He has been getting up to wander around loopy and the guards rush him and grab him to bring him back to his bed. There's no warning. He tenses from being startled then lets them lead him around like a puppet. They call this aggressive behavior from him. Maybe that is aggressive in an ER. In a normal world, that's not. And just because something has been a certain way for a while doesn't mean it's right. It might just mean no one has said anything.

I also do not think my husband isn't ill and I don't have any issue with him having a mental illness.  He's my husband and that's not going to change.  I just want him in a better care facility closer to home and they are not letting me do that. Since their beds are so full, you'd think they'd jump at it. 

Further Edit: 

I was driving. We had stopped for a moment and he stated he was worried, can we go to a hospital.

For the first 36 hours, I didn't say anything and let him handle it for the most part while I did everything they asked without complaint, but when we got there it was shift change and he had about ten different people in and out. 

His blood was not flowing well and his veins had shrunk. It was jacked up. 

The RN trying to get through was using the official lines as her job is patient transport and care tracking. The hospital would not speak to her to set up care tracking and transfer. 

His doctor prescribed him Prozac because he went to her and said he was feeling off with the season change. She wasn't ready quite yet to diagnose SAD but prescribed the medication to see if that makes a difference.

The area he's in is technically just ER Overflow and there isn't an actual psych ward area. They just put a privacy screen up as a barracade in an area with extra cots.

I never said I was a provider or a nurse. The whole point of that was that I told them he's requesting these wacky to them things out of them because we work for a healthcare company. I asked them to humor him. They said they don't do things that way. He still jumped through their hoops, just informed them he didn't think it professional every time. Once he got to know the person, he didn't do it. It was just when it was someone new. Since he hasn't had the same team twice yet, there's always someone new.

I apologise if my fear for my husband and his situation didn't make my writing clear and offended basically everyone. I actually wrote all this out, realized I had done that, then tried to back out of it, but got that...null error thing so figured it was lost anyway.

"My mother is on her deathbed, I am her only child, she does not have a Will and cannot sign one in her current state, her caregiver for the past 20 years just put my mother's house in her own name. Is there anything I can do?","This is currently happening in Kansas. Because there is no Will I understand her estate will go into probate. The caregiver/woman, let's call her Becky, has lived in her house the past 20 years and has a dark past. Although I am grateful to Becky in many ways for caring for my mom, she has lived in the house and has been my mother's power of attorney for the past 10 years. Becky has been spending my mother's social security and disability checks which amount to over $3,500/month. My mother was a teacher for 30+ years and had/has really good retirement. Becky is a certifiable hoarder and has filled the house with piles and piles of cheap junk over the past 20 years. I mean, we're talking about the conditions where you see hoarders on TV where there are small pathways to walk and everything else is piled high with stacks and stacks of, I don't know what. Becky doesn't even use the entire basement which was previously her living space, because of all of the stuff so densely packed. Now the upstairs is looking more and more like the basement. Due to M.S. my mother has been bed-ridden for the past five years. During this time Becky has been taking care of her with periodic help from Nurses and Aids. My mom is now in Hospice care and has been having small to medium strokes. I am told the end is near. I have visited her multiple times and Becky told me after she passes and makes all the arrangements, she will sell the house and we will split the profits. She wasn't specific. I am the only child, there is no one else. I found out today that Becky had to pay $300 to get the house in her name. I didn't even realize this was possible. Becky has mountains of debt even with my mom's checks she cashes each month along with her own disability check of around $1,000/month, Becky has always been in debt and has lived like this for a couple of decades. This is Kansas which is super cheap as far as taxes and cost of living. She always has excuses for where the money goes each month. I can't keep track of her terrible spending month after month. And Becky gets super angry and defensive whenever I approach the subject. I have a feeling that when my mom eventually dies, Becky won't want to leave the house. Or she will leave and pocket the entire money from the sale of the house. I'm sure she will have some sob story or excuse for why she needs it. She is already talking about getting multiple storage facilities for her piles of crap. I'm not sure what to do or if there is anything I can do. If anyone has an idea of where I could start I would appreciate it.

Edit: Thank you all so very much for the great advice. I am going to contact the adult care tomorrow and a lawyer first thing on Monday morning. I am a good person and will definitely consider Becky in all final decisions. I intend to split the estate with her, but this is not my main concern. Becky is ill herself and has taken advantage of my mom, however I do believe she loves her as a close friend. Becky has made horrible choices and due to past family trauma I allowed this for many years because I just didn't have the capacity to deal. I am ashamed of this, but am now ready to buck up as Becky doesn't have the mental sense or financial restraint to handle this on her own. Thanks again!",legaladvice
Walmart refused to let me leave with groceries I paid for,"Yesterday afternoon I 34 f took my four year old son and two year old daughter grocery shopping at Walmart in Irvine, California. I was waiting on my next paycheck, so I bought $175 worth of groceries with $300 in the bank. The cashier kept asking me to swipe my card saying the transaction did not go through. I checked my bank balance with my Wells Fargo app and found that Walmart had already charged me the $175 for groceries. I asked for a manager to come and fix the situation. Manager assured me the charge would drop off. He asked for my bank card to call my bank. He said he wanted to look at the customer service phone number, so I told him the phone number. I also called my bank. They opened a claim and said they would email me the claim number, but I checked my inbox, and I did not receive an email from them. I asked the manager to try to contact his supervisor to see if the situation could be fixed so I could leave with my groceries as Walmart had already charged me for them and with the transaction pending, I did not have enough funds available to buy more groceries. Manager refused to contact his supervisor. He said, ""he's not here."" I ended up having to leave a full cart of groceries with this manager in tears and drive to Wells Fargo to explain the situation. They told me there was nothing they could do as long as the charge was pending. They said to call them as soon as the charge went through. I called Walmart customer service and explained the situation and emailed their corporate office. This morning, the charge went through. I called Wells Fargo and let them know, and they emailed me a claim number. I also emailed Walmart customer service again. As a single working mom of two young children, $175 is a lot of money to me.

[WI] My employer wants me to wear a wig,"Can my employer require me to wear a wig?

I'm a woman with thinning hair. HR says my hair is ""unprofessional"", and wearing a hat or head cover was also rejected (""It's not normal to wear headwear indoors""). I work a desk job in an office environment and direct customer interaction is very rare. I have a number of bald/thinning male co-workers.

Is this gender discrimination? It seems that gender-based hair requirements are legal, so maybe not.

My thinning hair started during pregnancy, but I'm not currently pregnant. I don't have any other medical issues.

Wigs are expensive and uncomfortable, and my employer is not willing to reimburse me for the cost of a wig. They are expecting me to purchase a wig that is comparable in appearance to natural hair ($$$).

How hard can I push back? I can't lose this job, but I don't want to wear a wig every day for the indefinite future. I've been given two weeks to acquire a wig for daily wear.

My [21M] tinder girlfriend of 3 months is actually dangerously underage [15F],"location: australia

Some more things: to the best of my knowledge, she would never do anything to hurt me which includes tattling to her parents (from what I know she doesn't have a good relationship with them and they've put her in some hard places before) Or at least I hope not..

I've been looking to settle down recently and met a gorgeous girl on tinder where we hit it off instantly and have been pursuing a relationship for the past 3 months. Yes, this includes the physical side (obviously before i found out her real age). We have discussed age-specific things before, and she has always seemed so well versed in her high school days and uni work that I never even noticed anything was up. The age on her profile is 19, and I never thought to doubt it because she looks about 20 anyway and has the maturity of someone around that age too. She asked me to grab some cash out of her wallet yesterday and I found an old ID with her real birth year on it— 2003. I haven't confronted her on it, and personally have no idea how to even begin. I was falling in love with her and now I feel completely duped. Obviously I haven't pursued any sexual stuff with her after I found out, but I am so heartbroken. I'm not a pedophile but really have no idea how to deal with this! Any advice is appreciated

"Given incorrect dose of Allergy Shot, went into anaphylactic shock and health provider refuses to cover my expenses. What to do?","I've been getting allergy shots for close to 2 years and have been at a maintenance dose for more than a year (receiving the same concentration) .

My regular visit usually goes like this: Nurse asks me preliminary questions, shows me vials of various concentrations (blue - 1:10000 concentration, yellow - 1:1000 concentration, red - 1:100 high concentration), verifies the vial to be administered, verifies my name and date of birth on the vial, then proceeds to administer the shot. I wait 30 minutes to ensure that no major allergic reactions occur. During my maintenance dose, I usually receive 1 mL of the yellow vial.

During this visit, my regular nurse I usually get my shots from was gone. The substitute nurse did not ask me the usual preliminary questions, did not verify my name/date of birth on the vial, had the syringes pre-loaded with the allergy shot serum and proceeded to administer the shot. I look at the counter where the vials are usually placed and all I saw were only the red vials, which is 10x the concentration I usually receive. I didn't think of anything since the other vials might've been placed somewhere else. So I begin the 30 minute waiting period.

After 20 minutes of waiting, I feel really flush, itchy, and hot. I begin to suspect that the red vial was administered to me. The nurse checks up on me, I tell her that I'm getting a reaction. She puts her hands to her face, sighs, then mumbles ""Why me?"". I tell her she might've administered the red vial to me since it was the only vial I saw on the counter and she denies that she had given that to me. At this point, I'm going into analphylactic shock. The nurse calls a doctor and another nurse, administer an epi-pen, and call the ambulance to send me to the ER. The allergic reaction subsets after 5 hours in the ER.

I filed a grievance with the clinic manager to see if I could get all my expenses covered however they couldn't conclude that they had given me the incorrect dose. This is close to $2000 in out of pocket expenses after insurance. I request my medical records and see that there is no clear evidence of what concentration was administered to me. I look at the ambulance EMT notes, and they noted I was given double the allergy shot dose.

3 weeks after my allergic reaction, I go in to get another allergy shot and my main nurse notifies me that it was charted I was given the 1mL of the  red - 1:100 high concentration dose. This doesn't appear in my medical records for the day of my appointment, it doesn't even show what I was administered on that day. Now I want to take legal action against the clinic however I have no idea where to start, what to do, and how to approach the situation. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

I am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. My step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. Can someone help me please?,"I am really sorry if this is long but i have no idea where to turn to get help. I am also sorry if screw up terms. I am a minor, and i am about to start my last year of high school. I am currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

My mom passed away when i was 2 and we lived in Vancouver at the time. My dad remarried when i was 8 and i ended up becoming the youngest kid in the family. My step mom has always been mentally unstable and hates me in general.

My dad passed away \~6 years ago from cancer. Before my dad passed away he told me that there was a trust setup for me with a fair amount of money to pay for my university from his first wife. He also told me that his will was setup to ensure that i wouldn't need to worry about anything for university or need to worry about money. He told me over and over that i would be taken care of no matter what.

Earlier this month my step mom made a comment vaguely asking how i expected to pay for college/university on minimum wage. I told her what my dad told me, and she said that everything my dad had left was spent to take care of the family, and to send my older step siblings to university (she said it was ""first come, first serve""). She also has absolutely refused to help me in anyway as it is ""waste of her time"". I have ripped apart the house trying to find any sort of paperwork from my mom/dads estate but i cannot find anything.

I have tried to talk 2 lawyers who specializes in estates and wills, the first one told me he could not do a consult with a minor unless my guardian is present (no chance). The other one basically wanted a lot of money to even do anything which i don't have.

I have also tried to reach out to my estranged part of my moms family, her sister was able to dig up something with the name of the company who took care of her estate, but that company no longer seems to exist. My dad on the other hand was an only child, and as long as i remember i don't remember anyone else from his family, nor can i find anything.

I don't really know where to look or what to do at this point anymore. I am terrified that my step mother used this money to pay for all the frivolous bullshit she has wasted money on and pay for my step siblings tuition. I am also terrified that if there is really no money then i am basically going to get screwed hard, i need to get away from my step mother no matter what.

TLDR; I am supposed to have money in a trust/will from both of my parents. My step mom says this is not true and all the money left by my dad was used to take care of the family and pay for my step siblings tuition. I don't know how to find out the truth or where to even start looking.",legaladvice

About a month ago, I started working at for a large hotel company. I am a night auditor. I work 11pm-7am. I have a fair amount of downtime during my shift. 

However, I do not get rest breaks or a meal period. When I asked my boss about it, she said, ""You don't get a lunch."" She said this was due to the amount of downtime and the fact that I can eat a bite here or there throughout the night. Practically, this translates to me having to just stand at the desk for the whole shift, with no ability to sit or be off-duty at all.

I was given the meal period waiver during my onboarding and I did not sign it. I have not given my consent to waive my meal period (which only applies to six-hour shifts, anyway).

Do I have any options or anything here? Or am I just being super entitled and shitty?

- I am either engaged in work-related activities or am on call for 24 hours out of the day, 7 days a week 
- I live on site where I work
- I am not allowed to leave for more than an hour (only during a specific time of day as well)
- I haven't received a day off since I started working here three months ago (I have been offered a fill-in to cover for a few hours, but work resumes as soon as I get back home, and I have to find a fill-in myself in a small town of 500 people.)
- I have not provided my employer with my social security number, but they're withdrawing taxes
- I never filled out a W-4, and never recieved an employment contract
- I was told I was salaried but on my paystub it's blank where hours should be and my wage reads $8.00/hr
- I do not have a set payday and my checks have always been 1-4 days late, yet always show a previous (on-time) date when I receive them that aligns with a normal bi-weekly schedule
- I know that my employer is currently undergoing an audit and have been red flagged in the past
- They have a security camera in the office adjoining my apartment with audio equipped that can clearly record my conversations in my living room, and the only separation is a non-locking sliding door that's really more of a privacy curtain than anything, and blocks out no noise
- I have no defined sleeping hours, and more often than not get woken up in the middle of the night to attend to my duties
- There are no labor laws posted anywhere in my work area or common areas. I haven't seen one since I started working here

I know this might be a lot of information, but I just want to make sure that I have a case before I waste my time or money seeing as I don't have much time to investigate or get out of the office.

Ex is pregnant and I might to have to pay child support... except I'm a lesbian. Help? [North Carolina],"This sounds ridiculous. It *is* ridiculous. 

I'll start off by saying I'm a cis gender female. My ex is also a cis gender female. We separated about two months ago. State law says we can't even begin file for divorce until next July. She texted me today to tell me that she's 6 weeks pregnant. She's due in like June. We will still be married when her baby arrives.

I know from a friend's past experience that the mother's spouse's name automatically goes on the birth certificate here, whether he's actually the father or not, as long as they're still married on paper. My friend had to go through a paternity test to prove the baby wasn't his, and his lawyer said if the baby's real dad didn't step up that he might still be on the hook for child support. Because apparently the state doesn't care who the baby's actual dad is, as long as there's a second party to financially look after the kid. Luckily, in my buddy's case, the baby's father went through the process to be recognized as the real dad so my friend could be removed from the birth certificate. My ex says she doesn't know who the dad is. So basically, I think I'm screwed. 

There is no way in hell this child is mine, but I can't divorce my ex in time to avoid it defaulting to me.. I'm meeting with my lawyer on Tuesday but like, really, this can't happen right?

Michigan. I was denied a restraining order because my abuser said I'm kinky and because of my sexual history.,"In October, in the process of getting out of an abusive relationship, I filed for a restraining order and filed a police report and gave evidence such as text messages in which my abuser admitted to doing it. I gave the same copies of texts to the police when I filed the police report.

At the protective order hearing, his defense was that it was consensual because I have a sexual history involving BDSM, and that I was simply trying to ""punish"" him. We did not have that kind of sexual relationship, and hearing the judge asking him questions about my sexual history was extremely upsetting. They were laughing and joking about how ""you'd think it would be the other way around"" that I was a more experienced submissive than my ex was an experienced Dominant. I brought a eyewitness but the judge did not want to hear from my witness at all. He said it sounded like a ""bad breakup"" and gave me a restraining order for a few weeks as a ""cooling off period.""

Today I found out that the prosecutor is charging him. I know that there is a higher burden of proof for criminal charges than there is for a restraining order, so surely I should have been granted an actual restraining order, right? I want to know if I have any recourse for how the judge acted during the restraining order hearing, because it definitely put me in danger, and I worry that others will be put in danger too. I don't care about trying to get money, I just really feel like this is not the series of events that should have occurred. Is there anything I can do?

Also, do I have to worry about my sexual history coming up in court? I'm really hoping the prosecutor won't allow it.",legaladvice
Public North Carolina High School. Says my son's hairstyle and color violates school's social norms. (Update: Found a way around it),"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/789wcm/public_north_carolina_high_school_says_my_sons/

I want to you all for the help and advice that you gave us. I realized that this, while stupid, is probably within the rights of the school. But that didn't mean there was nothing we could do. A lot of you brought up the idea of a using a wig. Sadly, wigs also weren't allowed except for ""legitimate religious, cultural or medical reasons with prior approval.""

However, what did surprise me was that there were two girls who were on a green dye for months without a problem. This definitely sounded like gender discrimination. Allowing that dye for girls and not boys. So I went in there to speak with the principal again, I told him that I'm recording the conversation and after speaking about wigs, told him that they're allowing girls to do that but not boys. Principal said this is a matter of judgement because unnatural hair colors doesn't diminish the feminine attributes of women, but unnatural hair colors for men does diminish their masculine attributes. I got it then, that nonsense is all this has been about. They think a long and blue hair on a boy isn't manly enough.

I reminded him that this is gender discrimination and gender is a protected class. He remained silent for more than a minute, I expected him to say it's fine and they'll backtrack but I was shocked when he told me that I'm right, they'll reinforce this requirement for girls too. ""It's best to get rid of these unnatural colors from our school.""

I hate what I did. The last thing I wanted was to cause trouble for those girls or start a chain of actions that could have ended up with them being forced to change their favorite hairstyles. They were contacted too, and were given the same choice.

Two days later my son came to me and said he's spoken with the girls and they have a solution. They want to dye their hair a very white silverish color. It's naturally occurring because you get it when you get old, and some people are born with it as well. I know the more mature thing would have been to tell him to end this game, but I was a teenager once as well and I was even more stubbern than he is now. So I allowed it.

The school didn't like it. The three of them were called to the principal's office where they argued their case that their hair color is naturally occurring now. They said it's the same color as one of the teachers who is quite old, ""are you gonna suspend Mr. X as well over his hair color?""

The principal laughed at them and backed off. It's been a couple of weeks since then and there hasn't been any issues. And this new color looks good on my son.

So I would like to thank everyone that gave me advice on how to help. It helped ease my mind greatly. Now, on to the details!

Following what everyone suggested, I went to LARA (Licensing and Regulatory Affairs) and reported my old place of employment for not paying me around a month worth of checks after I left. I tried one last time to get my money from my old boss. When I asked him why he wouldn't give it to me he said and quote ""You fucked me over, now I'm going to fuck you over.""

That royally pissed me off. I felt hopeless when I read that. Knowing someone intentionally was hurting my personal funds because I left his company. A shame. But that's when I found out I was still apart of their email system.

Now I know this sounds bad, but they kept payroll on the email and I was looking to see if they were even planning in paying even though LARA was just about to begin investigating.

This is when I heard from the IRS saying I was misclassified as a sub contractor when I was really supposed to be a W-2 employee. I found my records in the email and sure enough, I signed a W-2 when I started.

Essentially the investigation ended up concluding and my old boss has to pay LARA back along with some hefty fines. His shop is actually set to close in a matter of weeks. Karma is a bitch.

I paid direct deposit for half before getting the keys, half after receiving. Everything went smoothly enough for the first week. Then the one neighbour started banging on the wall, and I had a letter on the door stating the bylaws that no child under the age of 19 may reside in the building, referencing my 11 month old daughter that I have sole custody of.

I tried doing some research, as it is an independently owned complex within a strata. There wasn't much to find. I called the human rights board in town, they told me I had a case. I called the tenancy branch and they informed me that I was not covered under the Tenancy Act, as, for the 8 days out of the month he stays here, we share a bathroom and kitchen.

He asked for the rent money early, two days ago. I was hesitant to, but obliged. That's biting me in the ass right now.

He blames me for this, and refuses to refund next months rent because the fine is ""my fault for not keeping that damn thing quiet"".

Picked up son from daycare and he was crying alone on the ground with a dislocated elbow and indifferent adults.,"So, before I tell this story, I'm pretty sure since there's no significant damage here that this is moot, but everyone keeps telling me to sue, so here I am.
  
   
This is in Michigan 
   
   
My wife picked our 2 year old son up from daycare where she found him outside, on the ground and sobbing by himself. When she asked the teachers why he was there they said ""he wanted to be there"" because they tried to move him to the shade and he wouldn't go. He also can't move his arm. She tells me this and I call and speak to the director who says she'll talk to the teachers. She calls me back and said the new teachers didn't know him and he was upset when one of them picked him up from behind. I ask how this explains his immobile arm and she has no explanations and says its not fair to jump to conclusions about adults and I explain that I'm not concerned THAT it happened, but they have a duty to provide a safe environment for my son and they have absolutely no idea how he came to be injured. She has no response. I take him to the doctor, he gets 3 xrays before they conclude nursemaids elbow which he has had before and is common. Is there anything actionable or that I should do? I'm clearly not sending him back there, at least. Thank you for your time.",legaladvice
[Update] Blind furry sexually harassing me at work. [FL],"https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8zaehq/blind_furry_sexually_harassing_me_at_work_fl/

Sorry for another update so soon, not good news. I'm an idiot. 

Last night I called one of the numbers provided to me and spoke to one of the employee assistance people, who assured me that they'd get back to me.

I had a short shift this morning, and he came in right at the start, which he often does. I bought a mini spiral notebook at the dollar store and recorded the time and exactly what he said/did as someone told me to do a few minutes after he left when there was a lull in people coming in, and my manager came and saw and asked me what I was doing. He didn't press me or anything but I was dumb and told him what was happening and that I was just recording it ""just in case"" (again I've already told him about that customer and he basically ignored the problem and told me to do that too). He didn't comment on it at the time beyond saying ""Oh"".

I woke up from a nap less than an hour ago and just checked my texts and he sent me a text telling me not to come into work tomorrow and that my services wouldn't be needed anymore. I'm freaking the hell out. I won't be able to find another part-time job that fits my schedule, I won't be able to move out of this fucking town. I feel like I'm going to puke. I'm so pissed at that dude and my manager and myself for not doing the notebook later. 

I was told to edit this to formally add a question or I wouldn't receive advice? I mean, just what's the best thing to do from here. Thought it was obvious I meant that, sorry. Thanks.

[IA] Ex-wife opened a credit card in my name now won't pay the $5000+ balance,"My ex and I divorced three years ago and have no children together. I was ordered to pay alimony for two years and my payments stopped in March 2018. My ex also got the house in the divorce.

In April 2018, it looks like a credit card was opened in my name with the address of my former house, where we lived while we were together. I had literally no knowledge of the card or anything about it. The first I learned of it was last week when I was served and given a court date in July. I'm being sued by the credit card company for the balance and lawyer fees. Looking through the documents, it's clear as day she was the one who opened the card. I texted her telling her she needed to pay it and she at first acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. She finally admitted that she opened the card because she felt that I was still responsible for upkeep on the house and her car after the alimony ended. She said her mom told her it would be fine.

I have literally nothing to do with her, the house, or her car any longer. The last thread connecting us was snipped after my alimony payments ended. Obviously she has some issues but do I need to get a lawyer for my court date?",legaladvice
Houseguest had a deadbolt installed after being reminded that he'll have to leave soon. Questions about the situation in general but specifically the locksmith's liability here. (Update),"TL;DR - things kind of managed to sort themselves out

So I got a call while I was getting ready to head back to the apartment to meet the locksmith. It was Pete's brother. Apologies for the lack of details here but I don't know too much about exactly what went down, and a chunk of what I do know is sort of personal shit that the brother, who just did me an enormous favor, probably wouldn't want me sharing. Anyway, the gist of the phone call was that he went by and performed a third party constructive eviction with the back of his hand. So Pete's gone, as is most of his stuff. His brother is going to swing by next week to grab any odds and ends that they may have missed. I am planning on making him dinner and hitting him off with a bottle of good whiskey when he does so.

As far as Pete goes, I'm thinking that I'll follow through with at least the early part of the eviction process just in case he tries anything cute. Gonna speak to my attorney about this first, but he's still in the wind. Turns out he's staying at a cabin his girlfriend's family owns and it's pretty much as close to being in the middle of nowhere as human-built structures get. His admin/paralegal... I dunno what she is specifically, but she said that yesterday was the one day he wasn't going into town for cell service. This gives us the opportunity to convince him that the situation is currently way worse than it ever was, and as much as I love this guy, he's really fun to fuck with so that's cool. 

After speaking with him I called the owner of the locksmith to let him know that the apartment was vacant, so his guy wouldn't need to show up with police. Turns out he was planning on coming by to handle this himself anyway, so that was easy enough. I met him over there, he had a handful of deadbolts for me to choose from, and he switched out the lock in about five minutes. We got to bullshitting about baseball because that's what you do in New York, and this led to him accepting my offer to buy him a beer so we could watch the White Sox smack our Yankees around. I got some backstory at the bar, and while this is secondhand information, the dude seems pretty reliable so I've got no reason not to believe him. 

The guy who came over yesterday morning was indeed an employee of his, but he wasn't on the clock and actually ""borrowed"" the deadbolt without mentioning anything. Turns out he is an old friend of Pete's, and had been fed a story about an insane landlord who had decided to move into the apartment Pete was renting. Brilliant. Anyway, my new locksmith buddy told me that this guy was officially unemployed as of that afternoon. I'd feel bad for the dude but I'm too busy not caring about what his motivation was due to the complete and total lack of any attempt to verify the story he'd been fed. This also explains the the non-answers I got when I called the shop - the person I spoke to was a manager who had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. He was basically trying to buy some time to speak with the owner and the guy who installed the deadbolt instead of just pulling an excuse out of his ass for me. I wish he'd told me that in the first place but I do appreciate the fact that he didn't just try to go into CYA mode for the company/his (now former) co-worker. All in all, I have a new preferred locksmith for when I need something done at any of my properties. 

So really the only legal shit left is the restraining order, and Pete very kindly sent my wife a few emails last night upon figuring out that she'd blocked his number. Not gonna go into detail but I'll just say that the contents should make the restraining order easy to get. 

So thank for all of the help and well wishes, but it seems like this is more or less a wrap, and a pretty amusing one too. My wife's gone from upset about the whole thing to uncharacteristically indignant, which she's admitted is kind of cathartic for her, so I don't even have a reason to feel guilty about laughing about what a moron Pete is!

Again, thanks all.",legaladvice
Neighbor will not stop taking down or destroying Mezuzah (NYC),"My girlfriend and I recently moved into an apartment together. Right away, our neighbor from a few doors down made it apparent he was a bit of a character. He professed extreme levels of amazement we are both women, as if he had never seen a gay couple before, and joined our housewarming party without invitation. We chalked it up to weird older dude stuff and left it. Then it got weird. Our Mezuzah was removed from its spot on our outer doorway three times. At first I thought I installed it badly, but it was layed kind of neatly against the door- it wouldn't fall that way. Finally, I ran into neighbor in the elevator and he told me stop putting ""gaudy decorations"" on our doorway. It's white, the same color of the paint. I told him it was religious and ignored him. I emailed our landlord who replied he would tell him to ""knock it off"". Okay, but on Wednesday the Mezuzah was shattered like someone had thrown it and yesterday neighbor told us we absolutely had to stop putting it up. My girlfriend and I are very distressed and upset, and I'm not sure what we need to do here anymore. Is this lawyer stuff? Police?",legaladvice

"My sister got kicked out of her gym, they refuse to give her a refund for it after they renewed it themselves","I will be using a throwaway for this due to privacy concerns.

My sister is overweight, weighing in at nearly 400 pounds. It is a very embarrassing thing for her, and it's always been a struggle to help her shed weight. Her endo has diagnosed her with severe thyroid problems along with hormonal imbalances that have been difficult to treat even with various medications. So a part of her current weight loss regiment is to exercise at a gym as recommended by her GP and her endocrinologist. She has enrolled at (x) Gym a few weeks ago.

Right away, she has claimed that she has had run-ins with a group of catty women. My sister has depression and anxiety, formed partly due to intense bullying from classmates and co-workers as well as abuse from our parents. So she tends to get overly nervous and makes mistakes. So my sister began to misuse the equipment accidentally, and the women tear into her in a very mean way. My sister apologizes but these women report her to the gym who reprimand my sister.

So for many days, my sister was being belittled and insulted by this group. They continued to report her and make her feel bad. Still she tried to ignore it because her health depended on this. One day, my sister got filmed struggling with the equipment and she slipped on the mat, falling on her butt. This was posted online and got passed around the gym and outside of it. She found out way later, and this hurt her. When she reported this to the gym, the manager said he would speak to the women. Days later, she asked the manager if he spoke to them, and he asked who my sister was (basically he forgot).

My sister wrote a complaint to the higher ups at the gym. She received a response stating that there was nothing they could do about her being filmed, as it was a public space. Three days after this, she received a notice stating her membership at the gym was cancelled. Despite this, she was charged the renewal fee. I stepped in and called them, demanding a refund on my sister's behalf. The gym told me that it was her responsibility to cancel the membership herself, I told them that *they* were the ones who cancelled on her. Basically the conversation went in circles.

Now what can I do? I have a feeling that there's not much I can do legally but I am hoping something can be done. My sister does not want to go to the media because she feels embarrassed and is afraid of being in front of a camera, also of the video online gaining more visibility. Can I take them to court? If so, for what charges? Can I legally compel them to give my sister the refund?",legaladvice

[Update] My landlord thinks I have a dog named Steve,"Sorry - forgot to link my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9spqbh/ny_im_being_evicted_for_violating_my_apartments

So - first off I wasn't totally honest about my relationship with my landlord. This was probably pretty obvious the more I commented but we're actually really close friends. Like I spend holidays with his family. So yeah, that's how I knew he wasn't just fucking me over to get more money. 


Anyway, I met with a lawyer. I like him. He basically said the same thing as everyone here - NYC is really tenant friendly, and if this makes it to court (unlikely, you'll see why) it won't be hard to fight. I don't think I'd want to fight though. I probably have nothing to worry about but I would just peacefully move if it does happen. 


The rest of this update isn't very legal. Sorry if that's against the rules. 


So - I ended up calling 311 instead of Adult Protective Services since Google gave me a few different numbers. I must have described the situation really badly because they transferred me to Animal Care and Control twice and then I was distracted by a fire at work (that's not jargon - we were evacuated because of a fire on another floor. The story is they were making s'mores in a conference room). 


This wasn't a call I wanted to make surrounded by all of my coworkers while we stood around outside so I texted his sister instead and we made plans to talk later. Long story short, she'd gotten some weird messages from him lately (like him congratulating her on a promotion then getting angry when she had no idea what he was talking about). Once she heard about Steve and the eviction, she made plans to fly out to us the next day. 


This is getting long (sorry), so jumping a bit - she told him some story and convinced him to fly back to CA with her. Before he left he apologized for blowing up at me and said that we could talk about the dog when he got back and try to work it out but that it was shitty that I did it behind his back especially when it was against the lease and he couldn't rent to someone he couldn't trust. 


I asked his sister about the eviction (just in case) and she said of course I wasn't evicted and to just hold down the fort. 


Anyway - so he's at a place near his family being treated now. I don't know what for and I don't really care as long as he's getting better. That's his business and he'll tell me if he wants to. I just want him to be okay and it looks like he will be. 


(I do know it's nothing environmental because I've had the whole place tested for everything. Also I've been staying there and I'm still fine.) 


His family is awesome and reaching out to me almost daily. I haven't been able to talk to him since he left, but hopefully soon. I'm also going there for Thanksgiving so I'll most likely even get to see him. 


And when he's back we can maybe start looking for our new dog Steve.

My friends house was stolen [OH],"LOCATION: OHIO

Hello,

I am writing this on behalf of my friend and co-worker who is fully aware I am posting this.  Below is a description of the situation, taken and edited for privacy, from a post he made alerting his friends and family of what has happened.

>My husband and I were recently paid a visit last month by someone claiming to own our home. ""I'm sorry..this is going to sound really crazy and I know you have lived here a long time, but I own this house."" Which just happens to be the home we purchased 8 years ago and where our family have been living and paying our mortgage. I immediately asked him to leave our property and contacted our local police department while he angrily began taking pictures of our house and vehicle in the driveway. To my surprise when I searched our county auditor's web page, there were indeed two transfers made in July of this year. We were never made aware of or signed any transfer of ownership. When I contacted our mortgage company to whom we make payments, they were not aware of any title changes either but they did make it clear that we are still responsible to make all of our mortgage payments.  
>  
>We made a trip to our county records department but no one could answer how our home was seemingly purchased right out from under us and the deeds transferred without us or the mortgage bank being involved. The department head and supervisor at the records department were just as baffled as we were.  The previous owner who sold us the home is deceased and the original lender is no longer in business. We then received legal council and filed a police report last month due to multiple very aggressive attempts to gain access to our home by a man claiming to represent the ""current owners.""  Apparently, our house should never have been sold to us and has recently been sold right out from underneath us. We were advised to submit a title insurance claim and begin preparations to move.  
>  
>We found out that there was a case that involved our house and the ""Detroit Fire and Police Pension property scam"" out of Michigan. That case opened in 2008 and the final judgement was made 4 years later. We purchased our home using a ""Survivorship Warranty Deed"" with what we assumed was a clean title, but we were wrong.   We have requested that the corporation evict our family and not return to our home again.  Fortunately, no one has returned since.  We were alarmed when the supposed ""new owners"" received their first piece of mail at our residence which happened to be a water bill. They have made yet another transfer WITHOUT NOTICE.  I got in contact with the water company only to get an apologetic, ""I am sorry Mrs. #####., Only the owners can change it back and we can not give you any balance or account information.""

While they have sought legal counsel, they are desperately seeking any additional information they can get regarding this situation.  Everyone they speak with seems baffled by what has happened.   I will run all questions through him before responding for complete accuracy.",legaladvice
[UPDATE] Neighbor threatened to sue over a wheelchair ramp,"So I put up a bunch of cameras around my property and hung up a ""Smile! You're On Camera!"" sign right after my first post. I also lit up the ramp some more, which I was already planning on doing because of trick-or-treaters.

I'm excited to say my neighbor's husband personally came over to apologize to me, which I caught on camera. He claimed his wife is ""stressed"" over their new baby, which…okay…and promised not to bother us anymore. I suspect one of the neighbors I talked to read him the riot act. I accepted the apology but am keeping the number of a lawyer close by and the cameras are always rolling. Dislike being so paranoid but what are you going to do?

Someone borrowed my photography gear and suddenly dissappeared and deliberately dropping my calls and won't answer my messages. Now I messaged all of his friends asking for help and the next morning he responded to me and returned my gears. He is now filing a case against me for humiliating him.,"Location - Philippines

Facts:

He usually borrows my photography gear regularly and this is the first time he dissappeared completely. Before he dissappeared he agreed to borrow my gear for a day only.

He has been deliberately avoiding me for about 10 days before I thought of asking help from his friends and families thru social media private message.

I have even filed a report to the local authorities on the 5th day, but this was taking too long and I need my gear for an event! So I decided to asked for help from his contacts.

This was effective as some of his families contacted him when they saw my message to them. The day after that he shows up and returned all of my gear. It turns out that some of them got damaged but he promised to pay for them.

He is now threatening to file a case against me for humiliating him to his contacts. But if I haven't done that, I don't think I can get my gear back!

This was my message to his contacts:

""Hello, if you know Mr xxxx please tell him to return my photography gear as I have been trying to reach him and he is deliberately evading me! He borrowed my gear 10 days ago and he has not returned it. I need the gear badly and this is costing me too much. Appreciate your help if you can help me contact him."" -- Then I attach a photo of his identification card with his photo

Can he really file a case against me?? He won't even answer my question when I asked him why is he evading me.",legaladvice

I figured I owed you all one final update. Idiot neighbour will now forever be known as asshole neighbour. We received a letter from a law firm representing them. The letter basically says we put obstructions in the driveway when we knew they used it on a daily basis?!?!?!?!?! They are now willing to settle for the cost of repairs plus attorney costs. I don't know if expletives are permitted here or not but FUCK THEM. I may not be able to block them using our driveway (see below) but I won't be paying them anything ever.

We have heard back from the city police and they won't do anything unless we are threatened. A wave doesn't constitute a threat so they want no part of this.

I also got a copy of the property map and the city owns more than half the distance between the house and the road (give or take, the city portion is about normal car length). We are granted a right of way. Technically asshole neighbour has no right to use it but nothing will be done by the city to block this (and there is no bylaw against it). Lastly, we cannot trespass people on the city's portion of our driveway. I have a feeling that asshole neighbour was made aware of this sometime around when they started using our driveway again.

I have hired a lawyer - he has asked that I no longer post to social media. So, with that said, I'm out.",legaladvice
Sister's ex-boyfriend keeps playing ding dong ditch despite us having a Ring doorbell and restraining order. Cops can't find him when we call them.,"I'll spare the details of the breakup, but essentially my sister's ex has been bothering us for about half a year now. We're in **CA**. Relevant events since the start of 2019 include:

1. Filing a restraining order and being granted a temporary restraining (about 3 months ago)
2. Ex being arrested for violating the temporary restraining order and being jailed for a day.
3. Getting the permanent restraining order
4. Being arrested for violating the permanent restraining order for a month and being released on probation. Probation conditions explicitly state he is to not contact my sister or be within her vicinity.

Despite being on probation, he's playing ding dong ditch at random times during the late night for the past week. We have video evidence of him being here through our Ring doorbell. We've called the cops multiple times and they take a while to get here and by that time they can't find him (or they don't try too hard).

Her ex is homeless, living in his car (probably), and disowned by his parents so we don't really have a clue where he is during the day.

It was easier to get him arrested the first couple times because he actually stuck around for someone to open the door, but now he's given up on that completely and he does not seem in his right mind anymore. Last time I spoke with him, he claimed to be hearing voices and we've heard him talking to himself a couple times on the Ring videos. He's not doing anything violent, but you never know, he could snap and do something crazy one day.

My sister spoke to his probation officer and told her the situation. He's currently scheduled to appear to court next month to address his probation violation.

I'm not sure if there's anything else we *can* do about this situation other than keep calling the cops and hope he attends his hearing next month. Anything else that could possibly help us?

[Update] Mother in law suing for visitation in ny.,"On mobile. Also, this is gonna be a bit long. 

Here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aq9o11/mother_in_law_is_suing_for_visitation_ny/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

We went to court for our initial hearing in February. I asked for dismissal citing Troxel V. Granville. The judge agreed that we were within our rights, however she couldn't grant a dismissal because my MIL requested an attorney. The judge advised she didnt qualify for an appointed lawyer so she should seek representation through elder law. My MIL begins raising her hands and waving them around asking if she could be allowed to speak. She states in court that me and my wife bully, abuse, belittle, and swear around the children constantly. The first 3 are outright lies and the 4th, so fucking what? She also stated that she never mentioned once being hacked or being obsessed that she was hacked, and that my oldest daughter was the one obsessed with hacking and spying. The judge made no comments and advised her that we weren't keeping her away from the children and that she should seek relief by visiting them under our supervision. 

Fast forward to a week before the hearing we have to meet with the kaw guardian for the children. We show the law guardian all the insane conspiracy theory texts and the texts where she accuses me of hacking her phone. She spoke with the children and we took our leave. The paperwork we received stated that my MIL showed her a much different conversation. My MIL had deleted the texts that made her look bad and copy pasted several from my wife that made my wife look like a bully and that she was harassing my MIL. The children outright denied any bullying/abuse and stated to the law guardian that my MIL makes them uncomfortable because she is constantly yelling at them, when they want to leave she wont them go and she wont stop talking about who is hacking her. So obviously she supports our position. 

In the hearing my lawyer asked for dismissal, and requested we be paid our legal fees by MIL as the petition was brought in bad faith. My MILs appointed attorney couldnt withdraw and refile an amended petition because MIL wouldnt let her so the judge dismissed and awarded us our legal fees. 

I havent seen the judgement yet but it's my understanding that it was dismissed with prejudice. However my MIL doesnt live in reality and is going to file another petition alleging that I've brainwashed my children. I wish that were true, they never listen to me. So I may have another update for you all shortly, but for now I'll enjoy my victory.",legaladvice

My 4 person airsoft team apparently traumatized a small child — but I'm not buying it.,"I'm apart of an airsoft team. We participate in military simulation and similar events. 4 of us were practicing clearing rooms — at my own external tornado shelter, which is on the opposite side of the house as this neighbor. 

This is in Illinois 

We all wear camouflage masks, tacvests, pants kneepads and etc. 

We set up BB mesh to catch stray BBs. We practiced the clearing, and used extremely small single explosive firecrackers as grenades (which are commonly used in local airsoft fields) 

The 6 year old APPARENTLY heard the firecrackers, came around the front of our house and onto our side yard, at first didn't see us, and then saw us come out of the tornado shelter and was traumatized.

We never saw the 6 year old. 

The mother came to me (property owner) a day later, said that the police were called by the 6 year old, apparently the 6 year old thought we were murderers, and demanded we pay for his mental health treatment. I refused. 

The child looked perfectly fine playing outside, but the mom repeatedly got in my face over it. I also never saw the police that were apparently called. 

She's threatening to take legal action now, and has thrown unknown chemicals on our property over the fence that have killed our grass. What do we do? ",legaladvice
(Update) My mother said she would kill herself the day I graduate high school (WA),"Hey. Well, some time has passed since I made the [original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/amczek/my_mother_said_she_would_kill_herself_the_day_i/?st=jxce4177&sh=bd06a7bf) was made, and an update is here!

Well, I have some good news. After I made the original post, I talked with my mother about the situation, and what was going on. Once I confronted her about it, she started crying. She said that she had fulfilled her purpose in life, and it's time for me and my brother to fulfill ours. I disagreed, and told her to stop with that, and made her a promise. If she kills herself, then her purpose would not be fulfilled. She wouldn't be able to meet the expectation that I want her at my college graduation, or at my wedding, or at any other celebrations of achievements. I told her that I need her to stay alive and that it's not negotiable no matter, as her simply being somewhere gives hope for future endeavors.

Last Monday, I graduated from high school with my friends, and finished my first year of college at the same time! It was a good time, and I finally get some breathing room for a little bit. I went home, hung out with some people, and then went to bed. To this day, she's alive and well, doing what she would normally do on a day to day basis. I wanted to wait a week to ensure everything would be okay, and I'm glad to report that it is. 

The day that I made the original post, it was closing night of a school play for which I was a part of. With many people in that theater department being on Reddit, a couple of people put the dots together and know that I posted that. To those whom I know IRL, I'm doing okay, and everything will be alright. You know where and how to contact me if you need me, love you guys. To everyone, thank you guys for the kind messages, both on the thread and in PM's. I'm thankful for even in a legal subreddit, people are kind and caring. Love you guys. 

Finally, if you're feeling suicidal, feeling like you don't belong, or going through a hard time, there are places to go to get help. Not only on Reddit, or on any social media, but through phone calls and facilities that you can go to. I know it's posted everywhere always, but if you need someone immediately, at any given time, please call the lifeline below. Thank you, and with love <3

"Friends reported me as a suicide risk as a prank, I was taken to a psych ward for the whole weekend. Need advice on legal consequences of their actions.","A few of my friends (not anymore) thought it would be funny to report me to the police as a suicide risk. I was out with them on Friday night and we had a few drinks. After I left for home, apparently they decided to call the police in turns (maybe 6 or 7 calls) each telling them that I was very suicidal that night and I had repeatedly told them that I was considering suicide and that I also own a gun. They lied about me being cheated on by a girlfriend earlier this week. I don't have a girlfriend.

Anyway, that night police showed up and I was drunk. Obviously at the time I didn't know what was going on. The police asked me several questions and I answered them, but I was also very sleepy. Police told me that I need to be checked by a medical professional and they're waiting for the ambulance to arrive. I was checked by the EMS and asked to go to a hospital with them for further tests to ensure that I was fine. At the hospital they wanted to perform blood and urine tests which I refused to consent to. I was told that I'm not allowed to leave until I am assessed by a social worker in the morning. This left me so frustrated and in the morning I was a little agitated by all of these when I did speak with the social worker, who then recommended that I'll be taken psych ward for further examination and ensuring that I was not a danger to myself and others. Up until this point I had no idea that my friends had reported me for this. The social worker said this decision is made based on the testimony of multiple people who know me personally who were concerned for my well-being and they can't take these signs lightly.

To make it short, things were cleared up at the psych ward (although very slowly) and I was let go on Monday morning in time to make it to work without being significantly late.

My friends (not anymore) had bragged on Facebook about how they've made me committed and were praising their skills of deception and pranking. Luckily, another friend noticed these and took screenshots.

Assuming I go to the police with these, are they facing any legal consequences?

My son (12) went through TSA with carryon luggage and a backpack with money that is now missing...what do I do?,"Ok so my son left Louisville early this am to fly to Tampa and he had 2 envelopes with money in them in seperate pockets in his carryon luggage bag. When he went through screening he said his luggage was missing and could only find his backpack and shoes for a moment until his luggage finally came out. He stated  several other people behind him had already gotten their luggage. So it sounds like TSA placed his bag back through for some reason? He said they did not bring him over to open his bag and being 12 thought nothing of it, really. He went straight from TSA and boarded. His flight landed and I was at the gate waiting for him. When we got to the car he wanted to take the money out and have me put it in the bank for him. Obviously, it was gone.  All he had in his luggage was literally only clothes and those 2 envelopes. What can I do really? 

edited to add update:
The money was his that he got for Christmas. His dad held onto it until they got to TSA and said he watched my son place the envelopes in the bag in different pockets.

He is reasonably responsible with his money as well and had made plans to save it up for some nerf guns and such. I filed a report with TSA as well as contacted the airline and both airports lost and found. So hopefully we will get some answers soon or at least an idea. 

It definitely could have been somehow lost between TSA and the final gate but I think we have covered our bases as much as we can right now. Unfortunately, it's one of those sucky life lessons.

"Ex husband is sending his family and friends to my house and my work, does this violate the protective order? And is this considered stalking?","Oklahoma here. So for some reference, my ex husband is a horribly abusive narcissist, during our marriage he tortured me physically, mentally, and emotionally. He kidnapped me in 2017 and I managed to get away and run to the police, where I got my protective order. I have PTSD and cut every tie to him completely out of my life, and I've managed to make a much happier life for myself and I'm even making progress with my PTSD. Well I was, until all this has been happening. Okay now on to where I need help! 

About 2 weeks ago I ran into my ex's best friend at the casino. He sat and watched me and texted someone on his phone for 10-15 minutes. Then a few days later, my coworker texts me telling me that they ran into my ex and he was asking if they knew me (we were old acquaintances anyway) and they said no. Next, about a week ago my ex's brother shows up at my house and rings the doorbell, and I didnt answer. Then, he has his stepbrother send me a friend request on Facebook. And 3 days ago, I was at work (retail) and one of his friends comes in high as a kite and watches me for a few minutes. And the final event, he had one of his best friends come out to my house this morning and ring my doorbell. I have no contact with any of these people, and I havent in over a year and a half. I've been a stone cold bitch with strict no contact with anyone who could even be friends of friends of his. 

So my question, 1) is he violating the protective order by doing this? I have no idea if they were trying to relay a message from him or not. 2) does this qualify as stalking? 3) what are my options?

I think my 12yo daughter is being groomed online (WA State),"My 12yo daughter got introduced to Discord (a chat app) by a friend. She has since been involved in some pretty explicit sexual role play with what I can only assume are grown men. We have blocked all her access to the internet at home. She's given out our home number in the past, the town we live in, and her full name. She has recently been given a cell phone so that she can reach me during the day while I'm at work, and recently she's given  (at least) of these men her cell number and I've discovered some pretty gnarly messages. 

I've done a reverse phone look up and this particular guy seems to be in Ontario. 

He has told her that he is 18. I'm willing to bet he's older.

 She needs to be scared straight and this guy needs to know he's talking to a child. 

My husband says we need to call the police. 

I don't even know where to start. 

Can someone point me in the right direction. I'll be bringing it up to her therapist in the morning. 

[EDIT]

She has a therapist, thank you.  She is well supported at home, encouraged, etc.  Thank you, also, for all the parenting advice in a legal advice sub.  That was unexpected but not surprising.  This kid is well supported at home, cared for, encouraged, and supported in any way imaginable.  She's never been spanked, rarely yelled at, etc.  We are not permissive but neither are we oppressive.  She went down the anime path, which turned into the furry path, which escalated to the BDSM/Role Play sex chat that she's currently engaged in and I'm not even sure she knows what some of these things are she's talking about with these men.  I'm thinking she should watch the Cyntoia Brown documentary.  I've gone through her Discord chat history and it looks like she's telling people we abuse her, her dad is horrible, and that she's alone all the time (which, for the record, is by choice because I literally try to include her in EVERYTHING), all kinds of drama.  

Her phone is a basic flip-phone with no data plan. No apps.  I'm going to contact her school this morning and get her chromebook access revoked.

My in-laws, who live next to them, started complaining about barking.  So I sent them a notice saying they have 30 days to either rehome the dogs, or they can end their lease if they desire.  

He texted me and said can we meet to discuss this situation.  So I said sure, come over to my apartment.  I thought he was going to claim they are service dogs or something.  But when he came over, he was in normal non-uniform clothes, but wearing his gun.

I said I'm sorry it doesn't work that way, you have to follow the lease.  Then he put his hand on his gun, and said if you want to make an issue of this, there will be serious consequences.

"Husband died Saturday, wondering if I have a potential lawsuit case. (IL, USA)","Not sure why my initial attempt to post showed up with a finance marker by the flair so I'm trying again... 

My husband and I boarded an Amtrak train in Chicago on Saturday. Before the train departed the station, my husband suffered a heart attack and collapsed. The train doors were already closed for departure and we were unable to alert Amtrak staff. There were no emergency phones or emergency stop buttons available in the car. A fellow passenger and I were so desperate to notify Amtrak employees and prevent the train from departing that we attempted to remove an emergency window.  Between the two of us passengers, we were not able to remove the window. My husband and I were visiting from Japan so we do not have phones on a US network to dial 911 so we had to wait for a passenger to do so. The emergency responders did not arrive until 20-30 min after the event began - even though Amtrak Police officers were only 30 seconds away in the station the train was still sitting at.  So basically once the train closed the doors, there was no way to notify Amtrak of the emergency.

I asked the people I am with if it was ok and they said yes but they made me let them read it first. It was kinda embarrassing but its ok. I kind of owe you all haha... 

My mother was charged with several things and is in jail but I dont think they actually put her in for the crimes yet. Like she's waiting on the police to get evidence I think. As many of you guys thought the only people in my family allowed school was my brother and me. My second brother was 2 so I dont know if she would have let them put him in school. My sisters had to stay home. This wasnt weird to me because it was an all boys school. 

They said I will never go back to my mom again and my siblings won't either. They also said what we were in was a cult. We were all in one big apartment building kind of thing. They said they weren't sure the cult itself was illegal. Just that some of the other stuff happening was. Drugs and that some of the stuff was probably sexual assault but I can't talk about it very much. Multiple people are in jail for it.

(Texas) Dealership gave repo company my vin instead of the correct one. Wake up and car is gone. My car is paid in full.,"I purchased a car 6 DAYS AGO, I've been waiting for years to buy and I've loved it so far, until this morning. The auto group that sold it to me called me and explained to me on Friday that they had accidentally given the repo company the wrong vin. 
         
Same car, wrong vin. So I've been parking it in the  back where hopefully the tow truck would be too big to fit in the tight space but I guess they pulled it off cause now my baby has disappeared.

  Where do I start off? I'm pretty livid that this happened 3 days after he said he tried to contact them.

[UPDATE 1] The General Manager just called and asked if they seriously came and took it after they left a ton of messages to the Tow company to not to take the car. He said whatever is wrong with it will be made right and he quickly got off the phone to jump someone's ass about the situation. Let's see how this goes.

[Update 2] I'm considering asking for my money back from the car, the warranty I purchased, my first months car insurance, and for them to pay for a rental while I find my replacement. They royally screwed up and I don't want to deal with the headache of them having to fix the car and it possibly never being the way it was.

Edit: Just to add the car in question is a 2011 Cadillac CTS-V coupe. So hopefully my worries about it being damaged heavily are more easily recognizable.

EDIT 3: Called the police and they told me it's a civil issue (go figure) and I talked with my attorney. He told me I have grounds for a full refund but I should have the car professionally inspected by a reputable Cadillac dealership and find out the damage and how much to make it right first and make a decision there. He says it's complicated for who is to blame because of the scenario. I'm going to contact another Police department and see if I can get an official report and call the repo company and inform them of the mistake just in case the dealership hasn't. The last contact with the dealership was over 3 hours ago. Still with no news to the whereabouts of my car. I had to find it myself.

[BIG UPDATE] after contacting the Tow yard they told me the dealership never paid for the car or after they got it from auction, so there was still a lein on the car so I basically bought a stolen car from the auction. I cannot deal with them after this. This is the shadiest thing I've ever been a part of and I'm dumbfounded I've found myself here. 

[Another EDIT] so they're trying to work with the finance company to get my car taken care of but it turns out my car wasn't the only one affected. This is happening to multiple cars all purchased through this company and I'm not going down without a fight. I'm getting out if this deal, it's way too hot for me.

[Update 6] dealer says they had bought the car on a ""floor plan"" which he explained is how they use the bank to buy a few cars from auction all at once. They closed this and paid the bank but the lein still exists until its sold and the automated system didn't pick it up that the car had sold and only saw a title transfer so it assumed I had taken it and just retagged it as mine. The dealer has offered me a loaner and says the car will be back tomorrow. He told me they could refund the deal if it really comes down to it but I would lose the money I spent paying taxes on it which is understandable. I'm gonna have the car professionally inspected and see if there's any damage and I'll decide then on how I want to proceed. This has been a roller coaster today.

[Edit thoughts] they say the car will be back tomorrow and I can use a loaner for however long but after finding it's been through auction I'm not sure on trust the car itself. I'm sitting on a spiky fence of letting my dream car go back and getting  my money back and finding another or just making the dealer fix the car. I feel like this is going to be a long road for me.

Coming off of the first post I made, John was continuing to make weird statements online.  I had a few people who are friends with him agreeing to take screenshots.

Someone asked what his proof was that we were hurting his business, and he posted a weird combination of google pictures of our storefronts, an ad for one of our events, and a listing in an old ad for downtown businesses that was printed a year before he went into business.  He also linked to a several year old interview from Gallery A about supporting high school artists.

I had my meeting scheduled with my lawyer on Tuesday Nov 7th, but he called on Monday.  When I answered the phone he joked ""I'm really disappointed in what a terrible art cartel you're running.""  It turns out my lawyer's secretary had been at the coffee shop when John was trying to get money and kept a copy of the list of grievances.  When I arrived for the meeting on Tuesday, my lawyer had a downright sassy letter ready to go for John which told him that any future threats would be taken seriously and then helpfully referred him to the definitions of a cartel.

For a few days, nothing.  Then my lawyer, I and the other galleries all get a copy of John's list of grievances in the mail.  This was the first I read it, but essentially pinpoints me as the head of the art cartel based on the fact that I was the one to sign the contract for the advertising page we took out in the local tourist book.  He also points out we have similar hours of operation we established without consulting him.  (A note about this.  We don't have the exact hours.  We just all are open similar times to the other businesses and restaurants around us because of traffic flow).

He also claims Gallery A is committing fraud as they show original pieces but also sell framed prints of the same work at more reasonable prices.  A new addition was the commentary that I (me, personally) had conspired with an ice cream place near him and told them to reduce their hours for the winter in order to hurt his traffic.  (The fact that they always reduce hours because ice cream doesn't sell in winter apparently wasn't it). There were a few other points, but those were the most bizarre.

My lawyer CC'd me on a letter that can be summed up ""Seriously, knock it off,"" and told him he was banned from my shop.

On Veteran's day, I got a call from the high school art teacher.  She told me that John had called her and told her not to work with local galleries anymore.  He said that if she ceased working with us that he would give her brochures for ""legitimate"" art schools for her students.  When she said she planned to continue working with us, John said that she was leading her students to poor practices.  She contacted me afraid that there would be issue with her students.  I said I didn't foresee any issue, but thanked her for her information.  I said if it escalated, I'd ask her to speak to my lawyer.

A few days later, I get a screenshot of John's Facebook page that has listed ""the Three Banditos are at it again"".  It links to two upcoming events we were advertising for the holiday crowd.  It also included a fantastic photoshop collage of myself, the other gallery owners and a local jeweler, each wearing a black cowboy hat and bandana.  Later that day the jeweler called to jokingly ask me if there was an initiation process to join the Banditos.  We have no idea why he is included, he wasn't part of the promotion John linked.

I found out at this point that John previously attacked a Paint and Sip that's run by a local business on the local tourist Facebook page.  He posted a pic of one of their previous group photos with ""This is not art"" written across it. He pulled it after several people pointed out his high end gallery shouldn't feel threatened by a paint and sip.  But before he did Gallery C responded by posting Magritte's Treachery of Images, which is so funny in so many levels.

Then things escalated again.  On Nov 13th, John posted a pic on Facebook of Gallery B, which is located on a corner, with sidewalks only on one side.  He pointed out that if someone were to take the corner too quickly, they would crash into the building.  Then asked people to do the ""right thing"" and drink and drive around the block a few times.  It turns out Gallery B and John are in the same professional organization, and they look poorly on threats.  Gallery B sent screenshots as well as a copy of John's list of grievances and John was put on probation with the organization pending review.

The next morning, John is outside my shop screaming that he knows what I did and that I have spies.  He didn't enter the premises and left when I threatened to call police, but I did get video of him on my phone.  The same day he removed anyone local from his Facebook.  That afternoon, John apparently went to a local restaurant and hassled the owner for details about what we are doing to ruin his business.  The restaurant eventually threw him out, but up until then the owner hadn't heard any of this, so he called me to ask what the heck this was about.

Nov 16th, I was opening shop when a friend sends me a picture of John in handcuffs.  We rent advertising space at a historic site where local information is kept.  John was found vandalizing our poster, its frame, and the acrylic cover.  He did this during the day when employees were around, no clue how he thought he would get away with it.  He got a fine for his troubles, but it got more gossip out there.  Turns out I wasn't the first threatened with lawsuits in the community.  I passed this onto my lawyer.

The weekend before Thanksgiving, there was a meeting of the group that handles the downtown events, projects etc.  Most shops are fairly active with the group and the meetings are open to the public.  As far as I know John has never attended a meeting until this one.  They were discussing the finalization of Christmas tree lighting and Christmas events when a John asked for time to speak.  He handed out this paper to everyone present which had a summary of his financials at his old, city gallery and a summary of his financials at his new gallery.  Then he apparently said ""I think we all know whose fault it is that theres a difference.  I'm not naming names.""  Then he glared at everyone until they got him to leave the podium.

I was given a copy of this by someone who attended the meeting.  John isn't doing well financially. I turned it over to my lawyer.

The day before Thanksgiving there was a notice posted on the community bulletin board.  It stated that there is a conspiracy in town to put new businesses down.  It then refers to ""certain individuals"" and ""certain unnamed shops"", and has several of the same bullet points as John's list of grievances.  It also says those certain individuals have paid off all local lawyers from representing the person who put up the poster.  This notice was removed from the bulletin board as everything posted there needs prior approval.  Gallery C happened to hear about it and fished it out of the trash.  We turned it over to my lawyer.

I had hoped things would de escalate now that I was downgraded from Bandito to the Nameless One, but no such luck.  That Saturday, the 25th, we hosted an event with refreshments.  The way this works is that we sell admission and you get a wristband and go from participating shops and galleries for food.  John did not participate, as usual.

At some point during the afternoon, two of the participants went into John's shop.  When he saw the wristbands, he went into the back and came out with a scissors.  He told them to be in his gallery, they had to cut the wristbands off.  When they refused, he grabbed at the woman's hand still holding the scissors, and was yelling.  The two left the gallery and reported it to a police officer.  Their next stop was Gallery B, where they told this story.  My lawyer has been unable to get verification for this incident from police.  (This is also, as far as I know, the last time the gallery was open.)

The next day, Sunday, I got a visitor in my shop who was acting weird.  He was asking my employee detailed questions about the business:  where did we get our artwork, what did we pay, how much was rent.  When I overheard this I came over and realized the guy bore a striking resemblance to John, only younger.  Let's call him John Jr.  I introduced myself and he asked me if I had any upcoming promotions.  In response, I handed him a copy of the monthly booklet the town puts out, which has basically everything happening in the area, including our events.  John Jr looked surprised, and asked me where else he could get this booklet.  I gave him a list of places offhand.  He then asked me if everywhere got the same copy.  I said they did and it was also available online.  I was really hestitant that I was giving John information , but figured by only giving easily found public info, I was ok.

John Jr left, but I found out he went to a coffee shop and asked if they had a copy of the booklet and asked a ton of questions about it and my shop.

Gallery C contacted me last Monday to let me know that John had gotten into a heated argument with a man matching John Jr's description on the sidewalk near Gallery C.  John Jr had left and driven away.

By last Wednesday, John had a sign on the door of his gallery stating it would be closed any day there is a planned downtown event listed online.  As there's something happening nearly every day for the holidays, this would mean he will be closed essentially all of December.

The next day, Gallery C got a letter from John.  It told him to stop walking by the front of John's store, and claims to have ""hours of footage"" of him passing by.  He then threatened to sue Gallery C for using the public sidewalk. (Gallery C and John are on the same street and Gallery C needs to use the parking lot past John's store, so he does pass by twice a day.). At this point, Gallery C decided to retain my lawyer.  He was told to cross the street instead of passing directly in front of John's gallery for the time being, but our lawyer also sent a response letter.  Gallery C informed me of this after their meeting.

At this point, I also found out through the grape vine that John had attempted to hire my lawyer some weeks prior in order to sue me, only to be told it would be a conflict of interest.

John responded by sending our lawyer a rambling, multi page letter that had some elements of his list of grievances and other additions.  While it probably was in response to Gallery C, most of it was directed at me, so my lawyer showed it to me.  it was mostly insulting my business and saying I purposefully am putting him out of business.  It also includes that John attempted to get this put in the local newspaper some weeks prior, but they turned him down.  We are trying to get verification of this.  My lawyer basically says if John does anything else, he is bringing the hammer down on him, and sent a letter to this effect.

At dinner, I heard a rumor John is behind on his rent and the landlord is planning evictions after the holidays.  Because his gallery has been closed, I haven't seen John since Thanksgiving weekend.

Gallery B sent a Christmas card with a cropped pic of himself in a black hat and bandana from John's Facebook, framed in a wreath.  He wants us to take a group photo in black cowboy hats and bandanas for next year's local business review.  I'm debating it.",legaladvice

&#x200B;

I messed up and didn't take the biggest piece of advice given to me repeatedly on my previous post: ""get a lawyer"". I thought I could just respond to the lawsuit citing anti-SLAPP laws in CT, fax over the form and wait for the dismissal letter in the mail...

Weeks ago, I discovered that they had not received my response and if it wasn't mailed on time It would be too late. I paid for overnight mail and it was received on time according to the person on the phone. Weeks later I receive a letter with a date for my court ""hearing"".

I went to this hearing and thankfully the judge stopped my former boss and his lawyer (who also brought a new employee to testify??!?) mid testimony and asked me if I understood what was happening because ""normally the defendant doesn't show up for this.""

The judge kindly explained to me that I had already lost by default for not responding, and they were here to determine how much money I owe in damages. I pulled out a copy of my response, and the case was continued. Today I filed the proper motion and paid a fine of $130 to re-open the case against me in the clerks office at the court house. I was told to wait for a response in the mail. I am also getting a lawyer if I can afford it.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I didn't get a lawyer and filed the paperwork myself. It wasn't received by the court in time and I lost by default. The judge stopped the hearing because it was obvious I came ready to defend myself even though I had already lost.  If you give a 1 star google review, run it by your attorney first.

To make it perfectly clear - I was not in a car accident nor seen by this hospital.

Because his car accident required xrays, the hospital shared my (the wrong persons) information with this third party radiology group.

The hospital has fixed the mistake and is no longer coming after me for payments, but the radiology group is refusing to fix it saying that the information they have is correct and I am on the hook for it. They sent me his medical information, what he had done, etc. They refuse to call the hospital to find out and the hospital is refusing to call them to tell them.

(Washington) I bought my son's friend a hamburger and some hot dogs and his mom is reporting us to CPS for child endangerment.,"As my kids are about to go back to school, we decided to have a fun weekend. I took both my kids and one friend each to a Mariners game this weekend. While there, we had cokes, hot dogs, garlic fries, peanuts, and burgers before the game. All basic baseball game junk food. I am always shocked at how much it costs but we had fun so I didn't mind. Last night, my son's friend's mom called us and started screaming on the phone that we allowed her son to eat meat. She said her son is a strict vegetarian and that is how they have brought him up and that we had no right to give him food that she doesn't allow. I know the boy pretty well as he's basically got free rein of the house since they've been friends for years. When he spends time with us, there have always been veggie options for him, but for a while now, he has decided to eat meat with the rest of us. He's 15 years old, and I figured he can choose to eat whatever he wants when he's in our home. I don't care. But according to her, I should have refused to let him eat meat at the game and bought him something else. She didn't seem to be aware that he's been eating meat at our house for about a year. She said she's going to file a complaint with CPS for child endangerment and interference with parental rights Monday morning.

Fast forward to today. I have moved to the Orlando area for work. I left my lease (24 months) two months early for said job and paid the final months in one payment. Today I get a letter in the mail from my landlord assuming it was the deposit back.

That isn't exact but more or less the jest of it. So I look at my lease, I only had to inform her of anyone moving into the unit if they were staying over 14 days. My mom wasn't even in the place 24 hours. Which I would have told her if my mom would have lived longer.  It doesn't say anything about dying in it either. Which why would it?

What can I do? I don't think that is an excuse to not give the deposit back. It can't be.

Charged $750 for a negative review,"Hi all! My parents recently just took a vacation to Key West, Florida. While there, they paid to take an hour and a half jet ski tour. While on this tour, the tour guide sped through and it ended up only being a 50 minute tour. She told the tour guide about their displeasure with the tour, speeding through and not being able to see as they sped through, and the tour guide was very rude and dismissed them. My mom took to Trip Advisor, Yelp, and Google to leave a negative review about their experience with the tour company. The next day they were charged $750 by the company, my mother called, and was told by the owner that they were charged the $750 due to leaving negative reviews which was slandering their company and then proceeded to hang up. 

Is there anything they can do? My parents reported it to their bank as fraud, the bank said it wasn't considered fraud and that it was a dispute. The local police also were no help when called. 

Since this situation occurred, the company owner has used my mother's Facebook pictures and shared them all over Facebook, with messages saying she was extremely drunk, and didn't know what she was talking about. (If she was drunk why would you let someone on your jet skis? Is that not a liability? 🙄


My father then called, threatening a lawyer and the money was eventually refunded. 

I just wonder how much these people have made off of people leaving negative reviews about their company. Is this legal? Can you be charged for leaving a negative review? I've never heard of such a thing. 
Thanks in advance!

"A licensed landscaper and arborist, that I did not hire, came into my front yard and took it upon himself to cut majority of the lower limbs off of my 15 year old Silver Dollar Eucalyptus Tree. Is this destruction to property? Is this trespassing?

When I looked at what once was a beautiful, full, weepy eucalyptus tree, there stood a wimpy, frail and freshly butchered tree.  I was in disbelief.  I work from home, so earlier that morning I heard my neighbors landscaper cutting their grass.  He has been cutting their grass as long as I have rented the house which is going on 5 years now.  I immediately thought of him, so I walked next door to the elderly couples house and asked if they thought their yard guy would take it upon himself to groom my tree.  They both said no way, but they had cameras and would certainly look into it.  Yesterday evening my neighbor came over to tell me it was her landscaper.  The cameras didn't catch it, but she asked him, and he said he did it ""because the branches were hitting him in the face when he passed by on the mower"" and ""he did us a favor"".  I was floored.  She apologized and said she couldn't believe he took as much off as he did.   The limbs he cut were at the base of the trunk, well into my yard.   He cut limbs that have taken years to grow.  He cut limbs that were not even pointing in the direction of my neighbors yard.  He made 17 cuts that I can count!

My landlord lives in Honduras, so we have very minimal contact.  When I signed the lease I took over all yard upkeep.  I have maintained all of the trees and flower beds, as well as the yard.  I have been the one to groom the trees.

We passed this by our realtor whom we had supporting documentation of us moving back when we talked to her in May of 2018 stating we were going to move south. She is so awesome she wrote a letter stating we were moving prior to all this happening and got it notarized by the state.

This should be a slam dunk and the judge will likely ask why are you wasting my time? Her reason for the requested visitation is ""she loves her grand kids very much and deserves to be apart of their life"" per the law she has no leg to stand on and this is not a valid reason she would be able to get visitation even if she does we are moving and i don't believe NY state can stop that. One last thing about this is the petition she filled out my sons birthday isn't even correct its off by 4 days.

[USA-NY] 24 year old male. My doctor called and told my mother he treated my genital warts,"I had one genital wart removed and my insurance covered it fully. Later my doctor kept pushing for a skin biopsy on my chest that was completely irrelevant to my genital wart. 
I finally agreed and signed the paper after he told me how risky it could be for cancer. He performed the procedure but the nurse forgot to verify that the insurance is covering it. I understand I need to pay because I signed paperwork saying I'd be responsible if my insurance didn't pay. 

However he called my mother introducing himself as the doctor who treated my genital warts. Then he goes on to tell her he needs a few thousand dollars for the procedure. 

Is that even legal? I thought he wasn't allowed to reveal another condition unless it comes down to the insurance not paying. 

I literally told the doctor my family couldn't know about the wart and he tried to use it against me to scare me and my mom into paying immediately. My insurance kicked me off for doing so many unnecessary procedures with this guy. He would convince me everything could potentially be cancerous. 

I understand it's my fault for not doing my research and being gullible so I'll have to pay for that. However I'm pretty upset he had to tell my mom about my STI condition when there was no issue with the billing. He was paid and it was done over a year ago. It was completely irrelevant to his call to collect. He called to collect from a skin biopsy of a mole on my chest.

I am the only black person and the youngest by far. My other coworkers are white, asian and post-grad. I am the only one with hair like mine.

The only reason I got hired was because I speak french. We get a lot of french-speakers in our store for some reason, and I'm the only one able to assist them.

I have curly hair so I normally do a half up, half down. But usually just leave it out because all my other coworkers don't tie their hair back either. I did slick it down into a bun during my interview and training. The slick down bun put strain on my edges and started to cause breakage.

My manager sat me down for a serious talk. She basically told me I had to wear my hair straight or *at least* slick down into a bun. That they have an image to sell and standard to uphold, they can't do that if I'm 'running around the store looking like a teenager.'

I told her that I can't straighten my hair because it will seriously damage it and gelling it down everyday will make it break off.  She told me that I have to abide by the appearance guidelines or I'll get written up.

I wish I did point out the double standards and hypocrisy. But in that moment I felt very small and didn't have the courage. When explaining what happened to a sibling and parent, they said I was being discriminated against and it's unacceptable. I don't know about HR or if we even have an HR in our store.

Way Late Update: My mom stole a trust fund I didn't know I had and now the IRS is coming after me for unpaid taxes.,"[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/39tlzj/mom_stole_a_trust_fund_i_didnt_know_i_had_now_the)

I'm only three years late but wanted to update this post. 


I reached out to the IRS who, after several phone calls and hours on hold, told me nothing could be done and to just pay up. I called one more time and a much nicer agent told me more kindly that nothing could be done unless I could get my mother to admit to withdrawing the money in writing.


I told her that if she just told the truth, admitted it to me and the IRS and wrote the letter, I would forgive her and we could put it behind us. She refused. I told her to not contact me again until she was ready to stop blaming others and admit what she had done.


A few (blissfully calm) weeks later she called me and apologized. She wrote a handwritten letter stating she withdrew the money without my knowledge and none of the proceeds went towards my care. I wrote my own letter explaining that I was already an adult immigrating to another country at the time of the withdrawal, and attached a photocopy of my passport stamps, an affidavit that I had never lived at the address the cheque was sent to, and the receipt of my immigration application which was dated prior to the withdrawal. I asked that the tax liability be transferred to my mother and included her SS number which she signed off on.


The IRS sent me a letter back stating that the taxes owing would be issued under my mother's name. Because she was a jobless crack addict, her income was under the federal threshold and she did not need to pay anything due to how low her income was that year. Disaster averted.


For those curious, no, I never got the money back and decided not to pursue it. I didn't know it existed before the IRS contacted me, and didn't feel it was in anyone's best interest to force the issue knowing that I'd never get repaid anyways. Mom quit crack a year or two back, but still battles her demons in the form of alcoholism. Our relationship has slightly improved. Also, I'm a woman (most comments assumed I was male).

I haven't heard from my kid since the service for my wife. 

I spoke with my family attorney, and he said that the state of Kentucky passed laws a few years ago that essentially reinforce the concept that the step-parent has no laws, rules, policies, or anything at all in the family dynamic. So, I'm fucked. 

We've tried to be amicable to the father. I've called, texted, no answer and no response. He came by the day after the service to get her school bag, a pair of shoes, and a doll her mother got her. And since that point, no contact. I'm going to keep trying, reaching out to the various family members on his side trying to get him to even pick up the phone, let alone talk to me. 

As for the legacy of my wife, I'm taking what remains of the life insurance policy after the payout for the service, and putting it into my kid's college account. Anything left in my wife's checking account is going to a custodial account for my kid, so that when she turns 16/17 and starts looking at a car, she has a down-payment for something that's safe. 

And then we just endure. 

Thanks to everyone that gave me a sense of hope, your well wishes, and any attempts at trying to help me through this horrible time. ",legaladvice
Update - Washington State: Neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. What can I do?,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5r4lco/washington_state_neighbor_is_currently_video/)

So a ton has happened since I last posted. I had mentioned in the comments that my neighbor had been basically using sound terrorism to harass us. I began a writing in a log of each event that occurred, with the time, the date, the description, if I called the police (I did for almost every one), and it began to show an alarming pattern—he was playing sounds at random times of the night every single night. After each major event of sounds, I would drop off a written statement to my local police station for the code enforcement officer. The city was now looking at charging him for noise violations based on my complaints.

I took my three page log and copies of seven signed statements and finally had enough of the police taking their time to work on the case against my neighbor. I dropped $95 on paperwork to begin an anti-harassment order against my neighbor. I made sure to explicitly mention the camera pointed in my bedroom window and the ongoing noises.

He was served the temporary order that very day by the local police, and sure enough, the noises ramped up. Before our court date to discuss the anti-harassment order, we were subpoenaed to be witnesses for the noise violation. We also brought the former owner of the home as well as the person who lived on the other side of my neighbor as witnesses to his noise-making capabilities. My neighbor never showed to the court date, and at that point had $1,250 pending in tickets. His lawyer showed up an hour late and the judge graciously accepted his plea to move the date a month forward. Disappointment.

Then the date for the anti-harassment order came. Once again, my neighbor didn't show and his lawyer begged for more time to look over the case. The judge was just and said that everyone has a right to defend their first amendment rights, so he moved the court date for a month later as well. Disappointment number two.

The noises are continuing on the regular at this point and we are trying to record them as best as we can on our phones. It was really hard to do because the noises were short, and happened at random in the middle of the night.

The date for the second anti-harassment hearing arrived and finally, we saw our neighbor come through the courtroom and sit in the back. When it was our turn to explain the situation, we made sure to present our call log, our statements, and videos that we had as evidence against our neighbor. Our neighbor's lawyer tried to get us to give up the call log because he mentioned he was not aware of it before our court date. The judge basically told the lawyer to go fuck himself. The lawyer's only defense for my neighbor was that he worked long hours and couldn't possibly be awake in the middle of the night to terrorize us, and that conversely, WE were the ones making the noises. We then brought up the fact that our neighbor had a security camera pointed directly at our home, and he should have plenty of evidence to prove we were indeed the noisemakers. The judge very confidently approved our anti-harassment order stating no more noises, no more cameras in our windows or at us in general, and our neighbor is not allowed within 25 feet of us. He immediately moved the camera pointing in our bedroom window to being completely flush with the side of the house. Awesome!

This was great news. We finally achieved some peace! And then the date for the noise violation trial came. Just his lawyer showed up, and made a deal with the city lawyer that one ticket would be paid, in exchange for no appeal to our anti-harassment order and to throw out two tickets. It sucked, but they took the deal. Whatever.

And all seemed well.

Then, about a month after the anti-harassment order kicked in, the noises began, again. And the camera began to slowly point into our garage, back in the direction toward the bedroom window.

This time, the police noticed something more alarming.

A red light was going off in the tinted window directly below the camera on the outside of my neighbor's house. They shone their flashlight and spotted a lens. My neighbor had a camera inside his window pointed at my bedroom window the ENTIRE TIME the order was in place, and long before that.

The officers told us to stay quiet, don't be alarmed, but they now were actively seeking a search warrant for the property to seize any noise making equipment and to take down the cameras, as he had broken the order.

The next weekend, my neighbor was arrested and we got to sit outside on the front porch while they disassembled the cameras and seized speaker after speaker, megaphones, etc. from my neighbor's home. They said he had four foot of insulation surrounding the room with the camera, and the front door of the home was completely barred shut.

Unfortunately, they just seized the equipment and will eventually give it back. My neighbor was out of jail the next day, and since they didn't have a search warrant for his hard drives, they couldn't place any voyeurism charges, despite my insistence. They even mentioned they saw me and my husband on a laptop of his.

I'm just happy that the noises have stopped and as far as I know, no more hidden cameras. I'm just glad I could update this crazy situation for you guys. I'm sure I'm not out of the woods yet.

TL;DR: got an anti-harassment order and cameras were supposed to come down, neighbor was a creep and had a hidden camera for a month while the order was in place, probably longer. He got arrested and no more cameras.",legaladvice
"[Austin, TX] Apartment maintenance workers walked in unannounced on my naked girlfriend, just moments after watching me leave for class, then take their time leaving. They've been watching her for months.","The maintenance workers in our apartment complex have always lingered outside our door since we moved in back in September of last year. We've had a few tickets put in for minor repairs on some appliances, and the first two times they came, they always knocked because the deadbolt was locked, even though they tried to enter without any prior notification. She noticed, as I'm usually oblivious to things of that nature, that they've been spying on her, like walking by frequently to try to see through her blinds, among other things such as minor cat calls. Today, when I left for class, just about a minute after I closed the door, the maintenance people walked up and unlocked our door without knocking, then walked in on my naked girlfriend, who had just gotten out of the shower and thought I came home to get something I forgot. 

She feels like maybe it's her fault because she had a ticket in for repairs, but I feel like this is predatory behavior, and that no maintenance worker should legally be able to enter someone's home unannounced, and that the main office should send and email with an estimate on the time frame in which the repairs would take place. 

If any, what actions should we take? I plan on going to the main office to file a complaint, but I worry that it may be swept under the rug or they'll throw some sort of excuse that I'm not prepared for.",legaladvice

Called the labor board today. Turns out it was all legal. The gratuity was an included and required charge. In Maryland they're allowed to take as much of it as they want in this case, as long as I still make minimum wage, hourly + tip. Which I did.

I guess I'll be jumping ship soon anyways. The place is falling apart and the owners can't figure anything out. If any employee in any department left right now it'd be disastrous for the restaurant. I already know that at least two other vital employees are planning to quit pretty soon as well because of how undervalued we all are. The owners have zero grasp of the concept of morale and how much it affects your business and the loyalty of your employees. I'll be happy to leave this place behind me and watch it crumble shortly thereafter.

The new place I started at a few months ago has been a completely different experience for me. I feel overwhelmingly valued, management is committed to supporting their staff, and the business is off the charts. I'm doing well. 

Thanks all for the support.",legaladvice

(Kansas) Renters buried fetus in my backyard,"So like the title says I rent a property in Kansas and my renters had a miscarriage and buried the unborn fetus in my backyard. Some background I'm terminally ill and currently living in Colorado waiting on a transplant. I decided to rent the house I own in my hometown. I had a roommate when I lived there and when I moved he offered to rent the whole house. This was a couple years ago. Since then he has gotten married and had a child. They were expecting their second earlier this year and apparently had a miscarriage. I should say these people, although my friends, are pretty trashy but overall pleasant enough. Around the time of their miscarriage they started having trouble paying rent and after a few months decided to move out. I'm currently in town for other reasons and decided to go look at the property and talk to them about life and whatnot. The wife then told me about the miscarriage and then told me they buried the fetus in the backyard. I was shocked and just kind of left without too much of a reaction. Now that I've gained my composure I'm worried that maybe this could potentially cause me legal trouble. What is my liability? What if a dog digs it up or something? Also I plan to sell the house eventually. What are my responsibilities there? ""Oh yeah by the way there's a dead baby in the backyard. No big deal it's not haunted or anything."" This is freaking me out and I'm not sure what to do. Should I notify the police? I'd rather not because they're friends but this is crazy.",legaladvice
"(WA) Neighbor who took cringe pictures with my car ia threatening me for ""ruining his reputation""","Y'all, the saga continues. I'm on mobile and don't know how to link my previous post but here's a summary: an idiotic neighbor kept taking pictures of and with my vehicle in our underground garage and posted them on social media claiming the car is his. 

I thought this dumbass needs a dose of online shaming so here's what I did. His social media accounts have a pretty high followership (10-12k) and as others suggested, he is indeed some kind of ""guru"" scammers. I don't really wanna say what type of scammer for privacy reasons (not that he deserves any). Well, I only have Twitter so I took it there. During his last photoshoot with my car, I took a few photos for evidence. I chose one of those pictures, tagged him in the tweet and wrote: ""I see [his handle] loves my car. That's cool but would be nice if he didn't try to brag about a car he doesn't own. This is him during one of the photoshoots in our shared garage."" 

Of course, it didn't take long until 1) dude deleted ALL the pictures of my car and 2) contacted me to threaten a lawsuit for libel (?) if I don't apologize to HIM publicly for embarrassing him in front of his ""fans"" and delete said Tweet. My ass was laughing so hard. I didn't reply which seemed to only piss him off even more because he was sending me angry emojis and curse words. I should also that my tweet gained traction and has around 120 replies and 300 RTs (I'm getting famous too!). Mostly, people are bashing him and saying what a retard he is. Others started making fun of his other posts (eg ""I'm starting to doubt he actually ate at that restaurant. Probably just took a picture and left""). Moreover, this scammer apparently claimed on social media that he lives on a mansion on Lake Washington and some of the commenters put two and two together and realized that he is actually my neighbor and there is no mansion. 

This dude basically says that it is my fault that all these people are making fun of him and that I am destroying his business (?). I'm not particularly afraid of his lawsuit and my lease ends next month after which I will be moving out so I don't really care. My question is, did I do something legally wrong? Can that be considered libel?

*UPDATE* textbook scam,"Good news! I posted a week or so ago about a company that sent me a different textbook then the one in the photo, and claimed the international version was  specified in the description. Then was demanding me send it to Malaysia for return, which would have cost as much as the book (the book was over $100). I sent many emails, then they did not respond for a couple days, conveniently those couple days were the last couple days in the 'refund time', meaning the book was no longer eligible for a refund. To say the least I was not happy. My bank said they could not do anything (I was given that advice on here), so I researched the Canadian Government on consumer laws. Shortly after this I had reported this company to the consumer laws in my district. They replied with 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention', and within 5 hours I recieved an email from the company with a full refund, and with the book still sitting on my table.

Invasion of privacy in high school bathrooms,"Alabama, USA

So due to the growing rates of teenage vaping, my school has really been cracking down on vaping in school and such, it's an immediate 1 day suspension, 50 dollar fine, and court date if you are caught in school. My schools resource officer has been reportedly checking bathrooms every once and a while to catch kids vaping. Today I walked into the bathroom at the same time he did, he was checking in between the cracks of every single stall and when he came across some kid taking a shit, he laughed at him and moved on to the next. I'm beginning to think legal action should be involved because this is so fucking gross. Am I an idiot? Is this not invasion of expected privacy?

"Step Father's grandson is ""home-schooled"" by his daughter. Child is 8 years old, can't count beyond 20. Doesn't fully know the alphabet, and doesn't really know how to play/interact with other kids because he spends most of his time at home in a small apartment.","(Note I say step father but my mom is not married to him. They live separately but I still call him my step dad)  

His daughter used to live with him until my step dad demanded she get a job or go to school. she instead left with her son and moved in with and married her boyfriend. It was around this time that he had to start preschool, and she said that she was going to home school him and she's been home schooling him ever since. 

Fast forward three years and their relationship has gotten better so she'll occasionally drop him off to visit. He's 8 now and I've noticed how far behind he is. I'm a High school senior and do a lot of volunteering at elementary schools. So when he comes to visit I like to spend my time teaching him. I taught him the basic alphabet, first couple numbers, etc. These are things he should know already. He learns very quickly and enjoys it. So I don't suspected he has any learning disabilities. I also read to him and once gave him a book as a gift. 

A few visits later while talking to him I come to find out that all he knows is what I've taught him and that the book I gave him is the only thing he's been reading because that's the only book he owns. He also tells me that he doesn't do ""learning time"" with his mom. ( ""learning time"" is what I call it when I teach him )

My friend has a younger brother the same age so I'll have her bring him over when he's visiting. While they play he acts like he's a toddler compared to him. I didn't think much of it until  my friends little brother asked him if he has any friends and he said no. He tells him that he stays at home all day. 

My step father notices this, and so does my mom and friend. We didn't say anything to each other not wanting to be rude or sound paranoid but the conversation came up and my step dad admitted he's been feeling horrible about it ever since. He wants to take action but doesn't want to get his daughter in trouble. She's living off welfare and I forgot to mention that she's legally blind. ( not completely but enough to give her disability ) He's also scared she won't let him see his grandson anymore if he mentions it. 


I'm really worried about him but I don't know what can be done and neither does my step dad. He doesn't care for her and only wants what's best for his grandson. He would want to get custody but he works two jobs at the moment and wouldn't have the time to care for him.

My car was stolen. Police found a 16 year old driving it but say they can't charge him because there is not enough evidence. Thief is the son of a city councillor [California],"My car was stolen out of my driveway. I came out in the morning to find my car gone and some broken glass in the driveway. I called the police and filed a report.

Last week the police called me and told me the car had been found and said that I could come and pick it up. I picked it up from the police station but the clutch and the transmission were fried (it's a manual) and I had to get it towed back to my house because I couldn't drive it. The police told me they caught someone driving it and they were working on the case.

Besides the window being broken and the clutch and transmission being fried the car reeked of marijuana and had empty beer bottles all over the floor. While I was cleaning it I found a cell phone under the seat. It was unlocked and it had notifications up. I brought the phone to the police figuring that it would help their case. This is where it gets weird.

The officer took the phone but told me there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone with anything so I should just cut my losses and move on. I didn't understand how this was possible because they told me they caught someone driving it and the report they sent to my insurance company confirms this.

I called the police again and kept getting the run around so finally I asked to speak to a supervising officer. The supervising officer told me they didn't have enough evidence on ""John Smith"" to charge him with anything. I don't think it's a coincidence that ""John Smith"" is the son of a city councillor. The supervising officer told me that the case was closed and I should leave this alone.

Is there anything I can do to get them to charge him? He was found driving my car that I have on video being stolen. His phone was found in my car, the window was busted, the transmission and clutch were fried, the car smells like marijuana and had 36 beer bottles on the floor. The bill to fix my car is going to be a fortune. I know that if he wasn't the son of a city councillor he would already be in jail. Also despite having a clean driving record and no criminal record I have been pulled over 4 times since I got my car back while driving my rental. All 4 times it was just so the police could ""check my documents"". A strange guy in a suit also came to my house and has sat in a car outside my work. He never says anything to me he just smilies and waves. The police say he isn't breaking any laws by being in public.

What can I do about this? Can I talk to the state police or the FBI if the local police won't help?

I think my brother's ex girlfriend has Munchausen by Proxy. Her toddler is becoming more ill. Help,"Thank-you all in advance... this is Hamilton, ON, Canada.

&#x200B;

Brief background: my brother began dating a teenaged girl with a toddler last year. I honestly would not have known she had a toddler except for her having mentioned it once. Over time, it became more and more clear that this girl is highly manipulative and untruthful. She somehow wormed her way into living with my brother and parents almost immediately, claimed to be going to college + have a part time job nearby. Having this girl as part of the family was very confusing: I literally would forget she was there because for hours at a time she would say LITERALLY NOTHING until she told some kind of crisis story, and they always seemed made up. Fight with my brother? Car crash. My mom annoyed that she was staying over every night? Sister came at her with a baseball bat. Brother finds out about shocking $50K in debt? Baby daddy extorted her and she has no legal recourse. Just all kinds of slightly unbelievable shit, but nothing major. This culminated with: Brother having misgivings about relationship? Ovarian cancer. At this point, I sat my family down and pointed out all the problems in her stories, and voiced my belief that she was neither in college nor had a job, and that she most definitely was making up the cancer (this I knew for sure based on the ridiculous treatment regimen she described). My brother confirmed all 3 of these things, (not before she claimed that they had mistaken a pregnancy for ovarian cancer) and broke it off.

&#x200B;

A sponsored post (SPONSORED POST. for more exposure, people) showed up on my page yesterday. It was a little girl in a full body cast. The little girl looked familiar, and holy shit, it's my brother's ex's daughter. I took the clickbait, and it lead me to the ex's page. Her whole profile is full of public posts about her daughter's MULTIPLE surgeries, rashes, and gastrointestinal issues. These are some of the most common issues that Munchausen's parents report in their children. I'm sure you know by now where I'm going with this. I'm absolutely terrified for that little girl. One of the posts describes ""third degree burns"" caused by ""fungi"" that the doctor found underneath her cast when the mother brought the girl into the emergency room YET AGAIN. The whole page is full of selfies with the little girl, and selfies in surgical scrubs. I know I have no evidence, but my gut is telling me that something horrible is happening. She's getting tons of attention for this.

&#x200B;

I called CAS, but they were rather testy with me on the phone (can't blame them, I have no proof of this), and said they will follow up with me ""if in the future we receive evidence worth investigating"". My question is, can I somehow alert the doctors that care for her at the local children's hospital? Could I get sued for alerting them? Is that defamation if I have no proof? I know where toddler gets treated because the mother is always geotagging.

you're BIASED this POOR YOUNG WOMAN just trying to DO THE BEST FOR HER DAUGHTER why do you HATE PEOPLE FOR WANTING THE BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN

3) I have heard more bullshit come out of this woman's mouth than actual truth. Of course I am biased. She didn't give a single shit about her daughter until my parents kicked her out and all of a sudden her daughter is greviously ill??? With all kinds of common things that MBP women report to doctors?? I'm concerned!! I could absolutely be wrong! I would be delighted to be!

you think the doctors are STUPID they would KNOW

4) No they wouldn't necessarily though?? (C&P from another comment) Let me give you an example. A child can get an infected cast in a myriad of ways (kids put their hands in all kinds of things!), but a mother could also put something gross in the cast to infect (under the guise of cleaning, whatever). This would result in an infection that is diagnosed the same whether the child gets it naturally or the mother does it on purpose.",legaladvice

(FINAL UPDATE) My new employer has a creative way of doing payroll that just doesnt seem...legal. Are you ready for a Justice Boner?,"Edit: a word and a state. SC. 

I was waiting to update this pending Big Doings by the corporate office, so thank you. 

So I quit, though I bet you all saw that coming. 

I gave 4 weeks notice per the crazy ass owners ""requirement"" because I decided to move out of state and had the time. 

Then he decided to try and screw me. When the schedule for my last 2 weeks came out, I wasn't on it. He apparently told the manager not to schedule me because I was ""toxic"" and ""not a team player"". 

But, as the saying goes, I didn't get mad. I got even. 

I knew he would try to call me in. Because that's what happens when you only have two people to close and one isn't working. So every time he called I said ""I wasn't scheduled today, so I made plans.""

After about a week he threatened to fire me. My response? ""You already did. Constructive dismissal exists. You reduced my hours to zero, basically firing me. I've already been to the unemployment office."" (I didn't, I was moving, but I wanted to hear his heart audibly stop.)

Then I asked about my last check. Since he's fired me, I needed to pick it up. He said I could get it on payday and hung up. 

I should also note that during this time I sent very lengthy email to the corporate office detailing every single shady and illegal thing this ass was doing. From trying to write work arounds for labor laws into the hand book, to getting employees to pay him back ""overpayments"" with personal checks, to the contamination, all of it. With pictures. 

So payday rolls around. No check. I call and no one answers. I go in person and no one knows anything because apparently, no one got paid. No one. Not even the managers. There's no direct deposit, he always cut paper checks (and forward dated them 3 days) so everyone was screwed. 

But me? I was walking on sunshine. Straight to small claims the next day with a written letter from the assistant manager (who's a friend, tbh) verifying that I had quit and not been paid and calls to the owner about it hadn't been returned. He had two days or until the next pay period, as long as it didn't exceed 30 days, to pay me after separation. 

He showed up and tried to say the Internet was down, which is why I wasn't paid on time, but the judge was having none of it. I got the max I could claim, 3x what he originally owed me. And the joy of seeing him get dressed WAY TF DOWN. 

And it gets better. Due to my emails and photos (along with other employees who made reports) Corporate descended on that franchise like a swarm of angry Valkyries. 

I was long gone and moved away by the time they actually did anything but he got ousted. 

Officially, he turned it over to spend time with his family (cause his daughter joined a Christian cult and ran away???)  but really corporate was FURIOUS at the shit he was doing and the terrible reputation the place had (essentially damaging the brand) so they threatened to rain legal brimstone down on him so hard it would make god jealous unless he turned the store over. 

According to the assistant manager anyways. 

Alls well that ends well. I got paid and Asshole Supreme got a banging dose of karma. ",legaladvice
"Michigan; I have dash cam footage of my dealer abusing my car (racing it), they want to meet this week to discuss it.","I have already made one post about this asking about if I should share my dash cam footage with the dealer in question, or if legally I was better of not doing so.

It seemed like there was no harm sharing the evidence, as long as it was unmodified (it was not modified).

The manger of the dealership has finished reviewing the footage and called me yesterday to set up a meeting to discuss the abuse to my car. 

To summarize everything that occurred;

1) CPO Vehicle was damaged upon pickup, I foolishly agreed to let the dealer fix it rather than taking my Credit Union's check and leaving

2) Repair work was less than average in quality, clear coat runs, body panel still was damaged (it was a fender and it was still bent on the inside). Found the passenger fog light is also damaged after the repair, dealer claims I bought the car like that, its a CPO and it should have been inspected (as per Manufactorer's inspection sheet). 

3) dealer agrees to fix it again, I drop the car off during my 2 week long vacation. Car sits at the lot, gets joy ridden back and fourth between the body shop (~75 miles round trip), Body shop wet sands clear coat, doesn't address additional damage, says ""we stand by our work.""

4) Found footage, emailed dealership with clip of footage explaining I am upset and want compensation for the wear to my vehicle, unhappy with the body repairs that are still not done properly.

5) ~1month to get a response, had to reach out to Corporate customer relations to get the dealer to respond after multiple phone calls/voice mails and no returned calls.

6) Dealership manager reaches out, wants video footage of incidents, I dropped footage off 

7) setup meeting with manager this coming week to follow up and discuss.

The car was ran to redline multiple times, the driver seemed to not be very good at driving stick, so he/she frequently was riding the clutch during these jaunts to high RPM, he clutch dumped it once causing wheel hop/spinning tires. My trips to the dealer have added about 500 miles overall to the car just trying to get the body work addressed and now the excess wear to the vehicle from being driven hard, this has been going on since the end of March. 

I am not sure what kind of compensation I should see to be acceptable (legally speaking). Initially I asked to have the dealer buy the car back from me so I could walk away from all of this, but I don't anticipate this to be given as an option. Realistically what should I expect given the circumstances, and what should I find to be acceptable?",legaladvice
"[Update] My neighbor falsely believes my disabled BIL was being creepy, and I want to protect him.","Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9hm58g/my_neighbor_falsely_believes_my_disabled_bil_was/

Hi, all. Sorry for never replying to everybody's really kind, helpful advice -- I'm bad at reddit and really busy right now. I really do appreciate it.

For a few days after my initial post, my husband or I would walk my BIL to his usual spot after work and watch from a distance to make sure he wasn't behaving inappropriately (he might have by accident). Neither of us saw him do anything out of the ordinary; he just sat on the bench, took pictures, and looked around at the trees and flowers. He didn't watch or interact with anybody else, which is about what we expected. He's so, so shy.

Per a lot of advice, I didn't delete any of my BIL's photos for awhile. This pretty quickly got to be unmanageable though, because he takes 50-100 pictures every day, often just the same thing again and again. But we set up a google drive to save them all. 

My husband and I also talked to BIL a LOT about what to do/say if he is approached by police. He is not very verbal and very quickly gets flustered and upset in unfamiliar social situations, so we really practiced pulling out his medical alert card and being very ""non-threatening"" with his body language (my BIL is 6'5"" but has physical mannerisms a little bit like a child's, so if you don't know him or why he's behaving the way he is, he can be pretty alarming). To be honest, I'm still nervous about it, but we practiced and talked about it a lot.

As for my neighbor, I saw her again a few times and she ignored me. I considered bringing my BIL to meet her properly, but decided I didn't want to expose him to her freaking out. About a week ago, she approached me and told me she appreciated my ""taking control of the situation,"" but that my BIL's disability was ""no excuse."" I said ""No excuse for what?"" and she said ""for filming and photographing children."" I considered pointing out that it isn't illegal to do that (as you guys did), but that would sound like he IS doing it, so I just told her that she isn't doing that. She threatened to call the cops again but so far nothing's come of it. I'm keeping an eye out. In any case, it's getting colder, and my BIL is spending less time just hanging out. He's also really happy to come with me to doctor's appointments, and I'm currently pregnant, so we've had a lot of those. (My neighbor started saying something about how I'd understand if I was a mother. I'm not showing yet, but I really considered telling her I was pregnant just to shut her up. But that's needlessly combative, lol.)

Thanks again to everyone's kind advice. Husband and I are currently working with BIL on responses he should give if that neighbor/anybody else approaches him while he's nature-photographing.

Oh, and thank you to the person in bestoflegaladvice who suggested a botanical garden -- we've driven to a few different ones now and it's really nice!! Thanks. :) ",legaladvice

I've never had this much karma in my life, and of course, it's on a throwaway. 

Special thanks to the people who work in UPS and other delivery services for clarifying the logistics of what happens behind the scenes.

Ex-wife's new wife is attempting blackmail,"Background: I transitioned to SAHD for several years when my wife began work as an attorney. We mutually agreed to a divorce a couple years ago and remained close. Because I'd put my own education and career on hold for her, plus a fair amount of debt accrued based on trying to make my ex's plans-on-a-whim work so that I could stay near our kids, I'm starting from rock bottom. I've lived with my in-laws for quite a while as I'm finishing my long-delayed BA while trying to transition out of retail and into better-paying work so I can afford a place of my own. She started a relationship with a woman, ""Judith,"" in the finance industry who offered to mentor me into entering the industry as well. Neither my ex nor I realized that Judith was giving me misleading advice while badmouthing me to my ex and her business contacts. A few months later it came out that Judith was manipulating and physically abusing my ex. My ex ran, but she decided to return after a week. Since then, Judith has made infrequent contact with me via text and email, swinging between attempts at intimidation and playing nice. I currently live in upstate NY with the in-laws. My ex, her wife, and the kids live in MA.

The incident in question happened a couple weeks ago. Judith sent me an email saying that she was giving me 30 days' notice to move out of the in-laws' and into a new place. (I had been open with them, before Judith's behavior came to light and after, about my financial situation and how I was finally saving enough to move out early this year.) If I'm not out by that time, Judith said, she'll tell my in-laws that I was emotionally and sexually abusive to their daughter (my ex) during our marriage.

(EDIT: Her threat was slightly more subtle than that - it was basically, ""Would her parents continue to let you live there if someone told them this? Probably not!"" And in the immediate follow-up email, ""You have 30 days to get out."" So it may not be quite so cut and dry. Otherwise I would have probably just gone straight to a lawyer or the police.)

Because the context is internal to a family situation, I'm not sure how or whether the law on coercion applies. I've briefly looked at the coercion statutes for both NY and MA, as well as the federal statute. I may have been married to an attorney, but I don't know enough myself to even figure out where jurisdiction would lie in this situation. I don't know what steps I should take or when.

Update - City police called my wife saying a store reported her for mis-scanning at a self check out to steal things.,"Well, I guess this was my welcome to the legal world. It's cheaper for my wife to plead ""No contest"". It doesn't matter whether she is guilty or not. They accused her of a crime, and because we can't afford to fight it my wife is going to be on probation. The fact that she could just be accused and suddenly we have to start spending without seeing a bit of evidence. 

Our options were pay $290 fine plus $50 for probation, or pay $500 for a lawyer just to help with pre-trial stuff.

America, where it's cheaper to be guilty, even if you aren't. At least she won't have a misdemeanor on her record.


She won't have a record because she was never arrested and the deferred adjudication means she won't have a record as long as she doesn't get a citation for a short time frame. I know there are steps after that. Non-disclosure applications and such. ",legaladvice
"(NV) Brother-in-law was attacked 2 nights ago, shot several times, exchanged gunfire with the attacker. Police took his wallet with $1,500 in it, and have made a suspicious call to hospital.","Short backstory, my brother-in-law was ambushed outside of his home after being dropped off be a female coworker. The initial story is that her ex-boyfriend had followed them home and attacked my BIL when he got out of the car. My BIL returned fire and hit him, and they're both in the hospital. There are a lot of stories flying around between everyone, it's not clear yet what the whole truth is. Aside from that, I have two more practical immediate concerns.



The call that the police made to the hospital was requesting his medical file number. The nurses didn't disclose any information to the officer that called because my BIL was admitted into the trauma ward without his name being registered. Following that, the officer then called my MIL for the number, and told her it was so that he could see what the blood tests said. 


My wife told her mom to make sure it was all on the up and up before returning the call, and the nurses overheard and told my MIL to provide a recently assigned social workers number to the police, and tell them to handle whether or not the police have access to that information.


Sorry, I know that's long without a question, but I guess what I want to know is, is this actually a concerning event? Does this smell wrong? My brother in law doesn't have the best criminal history, but he's done a lot of work to expunge his records, and the gun he used to defend himself is legally his. The details are still pretty coming out, I understand why the police are investigating things, but there is a real concern that they are looking for something to besmirch his character. It feels like they want to find out if he had drugs in his system, and I just don't think that's appropriate for them to be looking at without a warrant.


Also what we can do to try to make sure he gets his money back? He had just cashed his paycheck and I've heard way too many stories about people losing their property to civil forfeiture.Can we demand some sort of itemization of things that they have seized from him as evidence? What can be done to ensure he gets his things back?

The first day I was woken out of bed at 11:15 PM to be accused of hiding in the ditch with camouflage and a camera trying to get photos of her at home, and shining bright lights and laser beams in the direction of her home and flashing lights inside my own house.

"[Manitoba, CANADA] My cousin lives in a basement suite. His landlord has recently enacted a new rule in their home that states ""Lights Out By 10PM"" - which is enforced via circuit breakers to ""save on power"" and lower landlord's power bills, except my cousin is paying for his own power.","As the title states, my cousin is currently renting a basement suite in the house of an older gentleman who owns the property. Legally, the renting situation is done by the book and follows the law to a T. However, three weeks ago my cousin received a notice stating that there will be a new addition to the rules that says ""Lights Out By 10PM"". My cousin isn't overly bothered by this as he is usually in bed by 9PM anyways, and he can understand his elderly landlord wanting peace and quiet at night. Unfortunately, he realized immediately (when it first came into effect) that this is enforced by the landlord by physically turning off the power to the whole house by use of the circuit breakers - aside from the breakers for the refrigerators and freezers. This leads to a few problems:

1. My cousin is unable to see where he is going when using the bathroom or getting water at night without the use of a flashlight or phone (candles are forbidden in the basement suite).
2. My cousin is unable to charge his phone overnight, which is a major issue as he needs it for an alarm and worries about it dying - leading him to potentially sleep in. He can't even run an extension cord from the same socket as the fridge and freezer because he might blow the breaker, and the new rule specifically states that extension cords are not permitted if they are going to be used to circumvent the new rule.
3. The landlord rarely turns on the power at the designated time (8am) due to him either sleeping in, going to church, or just straight up forgetting. This leads to shits, showers, and shaves in the dark (no bathroom window) and is generally an inconvenience.
4. My cousin pays for his own power, and therefore he should be allowed to use his power as he sees fit. Instead, he has to live with this situation because his landlord wants cheaper bills.


We both understand that this a silly first world problem, but he is tired of feeling like he's living the Amish lifestyle and wants to know if there is any legal recourse he could take to find common ground with his landlord. He isn't look to sue the poor man, he just wants to use his own power and is willing to make compromises so both of them are happy. If he could just have the breaker for the bathroom lights and the one for his nightstand/phone charger, he would be a happy camper - however his landlord refuses to budge.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to approach this? What kind of lawyer will he need in this situation? Thank you so much for taking the time read this and offering advice. It is GREATLY appreciated. Take care.",legaladvice

I was sitting at a gas station waiting for my cousin to come out the store with my dog in the back seat(Husky if that's important). This man walks out and he was obviously intoxicated(i later found out from my cousin that the store owners wouldn't sell to him because of how Intoxicated he was). The man starts walking towards my car and i reach over to lock my doors, the man opens my door before I get a chance to lock it and sits down in back seat and then closes the door. 
   
 At first I'm calm and ask him politely to get out of my car, the man just smiles at me before locking the door(using the little door lock thing). While I'm talking to the man my dog starts growling at him, i think he sensed that i was frightened.I jump out of my car and start screaming at him to get the fuck out of my car, shoo go away, this isn't your car, go away, etc. The guy doesn't get out and shoved my dog away from him(he was growling) and then my dog starts to attack him. My dog bit him 4 times before I was able to open the back door and pull him off.

(US) ex seeking full custody of the kids for the 4th time. Feels like I'm going crazy.,"I posted this in r/divorce before. Adding updates as to what has unfolded. 

Throw away account because he stalks every thing I do. Just to be safe.

Two years ago I (now 29F) was out of the blue handed separation papers from my husband (now 30m)... this led to one of the worst times of my life. I found out he was having an affair. Was taking our 3 children to her house and telling them not to tell me or they'd get in trouble. His behavior toward me changed dramatically. He became extremely abusive and the police were called to our home. (He was forcing me to move out but at the time I had nowhere to go, I had no money on my own.) Two long days later he's charged with a domestic violence charge, and I get granted a temporary protective order. We get to court, judge drops it because he's calm in court but warns him if he even touches me he will go to jail. Eventually he pleads guilty to his charge and gets a year probation. We go to court again. He wants full custody. Drags me through the mud. Judge said no way and gave us a 50/50 split. He's still with the woman he has an affair with. I ask for 6 months of no paramours around the children because he wanted to move her in immediately and I believed the kids needed some healing time. Judge agrees and adds it. He's livid. In the 6 month period he gets her pregnant. We go back to court again after the 6 months.  He again asks for full custody. Judge denies and keeps it at 50/50 because it's working for the kids. The other woman however we find out after court had moved in about a month before the 6 month period had ended. He told the kids, again, to lie to me or they'd be in trouble. Some time passes, I meet an amazing man. We were good friends first, then decided to try dating. Dating is perfect. I introduce him to the kids. The kids adore him, he adores the kids. It's going nearly perfect. Except my ex is flipping out because how dare I move on. How dare I involve him with the kids. I don't deserve to move on he claims. More time passes. We move in together. Kids have their own rooms. They love it here! My divorce finally becomes final. Ex gets married the very next day after we are granted the divorce. The next day after that he files a show cause because I moved in with boyfriend. He wants full custody again. My youngest then tells my mother that some strange things have been going on with daddy and she doesn't think it's right. Daddy tells her not to trust mommy's boyfriend because he's going to hurt them and touch them in the no no places. This goes on. More and more of these comments are revealed that my ex is telling them my boyfriend is going to hurt them. We go for our pre-trial for the show cause, it's granted to move forward. Date is set. Not a week later I get a call from cps that they need to investigate an allegation that my boyfriend touched my oldest. We do the interview, cps clears him completely. It's obvious he hasn't done anything because he's never left alone with the kids. I'm in charge of baths, etc. However, the cps worker thinks she has been abused, but she was coached to say it was my boyfriend. They seem to think it was my ex or my ex's father or my ex knows it's his father and he's covering it up. So now they are investigating his family instead. We are waiting for the results and What is uncovered. 

Im shaking all the time. I haven't slept right in days. I can barely eat. My baby was hurt. I knew it in my gut. It was attempted to be pegged on my boyfriend but they found no way for the allegation to be possible. 

It's all a mess. This is beyond who deserves custody. This is who hurt my daughter. How can I get justice for my daughter and help her heal from this .. 

Update: my boyfriend has been 100% cleared of any allegations. It was ruled unfounded, as we expected. However, the ex has decided to ignore our custody agreement and only give two of our three kids to me. We did week on week off. When I went to get them at our usual meetinf spot a month and a half ago, I was met by an off duty police officer that was a friend of his family letting me know I would only be getting two of the children as the oldest is now ""terrified of her mother and the mother's boyfriend."" I attempted to call another police officer but they said it was a civil matter. I filed a show cause for him violating the custodial agreement. Tomorrow is our court date. I have not seen my oldest child in over a month, have not been allowed to talk to her, or my questions about how she is doing are ignored. Ex just won't talk to me at all. 

My attorney says this is an obvious and clear cut case of parental alienation and it's obvious he wasn't getting his way so he escalated his claims to attempt to get custody. 

Obviously, I don't think this is going to be a cake walk. However, I just want to know I'm not crazy and this is actually an attempt at parental alienation and I'm not going to lose my children to a monster who is an expert of maniuplation.

[Ontario] My Roomate has just told me I'm supposed to move out so her boyfriend can move in *We are both on the lease*,"Location: Ontario. 

I have been on lease at a shared two bedroom with a roommate for 3+ years. Both of our names are on the lease. 

Due to health reasons, I legally subletted my room for 8 months (ongoing.) The landlord has approved the sublease. I am in a different city with family, currently. Did due dillegence to find a great roommate to share spade etc, they (the subletter and roommate) get along fine etc. 

My roomate has messaged be out of the blue, now saying that she intends for her new boyfriend of four months to move in after the sublease ends in June, and if I want to return to the city, I will have to find new accommodation, as he will be replacing me. 

Now, I fully intend to move back to the city- as I have to finish my Uni degree there. The location is ideal and frankly I wouldn't be able to find something as affordable (I pay under 500 for my room) and would likely have to put off returning to school longer if I needed to worry about moving expenses and now pay 700+ in rent in rando student accommodation. The apartment, I view as my home, as I do not have permanent residence elsewhere. 

So, I don't want to leave. Does she have a legal case to 'kick me out', provided I don't extend the sublease past 12 months? 

Additionally, what can I do to protect myself? 

Additional context: my sublets room is furnished with my furniture, and about half the apartment furniture is mine / all the plates etc. I left those items there because I have known my roomate for 8 years and intended on returning. (Although, they made a fuss about me keeping things in our storage locker, wanted me to leave certain things but empty them of my belongs so they could use etc..  but that's a story for another time and another subreddit)

They have a wee bit of a mean streak, and I just want to make sure all my bases are legally covered, so that I can return assuming I don't find other accommodation. (In the far off hypothetical I found something better, I would give 60 days notice to the landlord, her etc) 

I am hoping this can be sorted though us talking. 

Last- is there anyway she could move the boyfriend in without my consent if he is not on the lease? 

Thanks in advance guys.


Edit: thanks for the response so far. To clarify 

Regarding Lease Renewal: This is our 4th year on the lease, and in Ontario once you've been a resident for 12 months, the lease rolls over month to month, to my understanding. For the past two years we have, at the end of 12 month in july, we have signed new rental agreement's with the max allowable rent raise (1.5% a year or something) 

So I believe that I am legally protected by the lease, and my right to the apartment stay as long as subletting is less than a year and a day. (I still pay the rent, after deposited to me by the subletter and the onus if the subletter *did not * pay fall soley on me)

Could someone versed in Ontario Law please confirm my understanding? 

Updated: Wow everyone thanks for all the advice. I'm hoping to resolve this with my roommate and I've sent her a message. I'll also be looking into chatting with a professional if nessisary.  ",legaladvice
Fiancée stuck in Saudi Arabia,"Hello. I'm not sure if this is American-only legal advice sub reddit but since I know nowhere else to post this, then here goes.

She's from the Philippines and I'm from Iraq. She works as a nurse there and have wanted to leave for a year now, but the employer won't give her an exit visa, and he keeps extending her stay there. They told us last year that they'll let her go back on March. And now they are saying it's extended till August.

I'm not sure what to do. I tried talking to the manager and the accountant, but it was useless. I want to talk to the employer directly but I'm not sure what to say. I'm afraid I'll make it worse.


Edit : thank you for your responses. She can't physically go to the Philippines embassy 1. Because she's a woman and she can't go alone and 2. Because it's in another city

But Ill tell her to contact them via phone. I'm not sure how much help that would be.

The reason for not giving her the permission so she can have her visa is, from what they told us, they don't have enough nurses and they need her, and because they paid alot of money to her residencey so they want her to ""work it's worth""

Thank you all for your responses! I'm really grateful for all of your help! ",legaladvice

But not at the shop -- at her home. I sent my boyfriend to grab it to avoid a bizarre confrontation with her. She left it on the porch and wouldn't answer the door. She left a valuable painting on her porch, outdoors, for hours. Whatever, I have it back and never have to talk to her again.

Dumb Prank went too far (Ohio),"Asking for my little sister, who isn't on reddit:

My sister was the victim of a dumb prank that went too far. Some of her buddies watched the movie *Scream*. They got one of those spooky masks and went to our house when she was home alone. One of them tapped on the window, and another rattled the door knobs. My sister didn't know who they were, so she locked herself in a room and called 911.

Anyway, the guys were still there when the police got there, and they ended up being charged with ""Aggravated Menacing"" and since one of them had a real knife, there was an accelerated charge for that. Also, because my sister was 16 and all the guys were 18, it was considered child abuse?? 

My sister didn't want to press charges once she realized it was just her friends, but a magistrate (?) is pressing charges now. She doesn't want to testify, but they are making her. Even worse, this wound up on local social media, and she is being accused of ""ruining their lives"" and getting harassment for that. What should she do? ",legaladvice

[Chicago] I was robbed by my AirBnB host. Looking for legal advice.,"This all took place over the past weekend (Friday/Saturday, June 14-15) in Chicago.  I already filed a police report, as well as brought this to the attention of AirBnB both over the phone and on Twitter.

Unlike my posts about this incident elsewhere, I'll be as thorough in explaining the situation here as to get the most relevant advice possible.  I apologize in advance for the essay, but please read all of of it if you want to give advice, to make sure you get the whole story.

I was in Chicago for the weekend for Pokémon Go Fest - for those unfamiliar, it's an all-day paid event hosted at a park, this year it was at Grant Park.  My ticket date was for Friday the 14th.

Earlier that week (Monday I think?) I went on Airbnb to look for affordable options.  By this point, all the hotels in the area were close to $300 a night, and most Airbnb's within a mile or two of Grant Park were either already booked or also that expensive.  I found what looked to be a good deal south of downtown for around $85 a night.  The host had mostly positive reviews, with the only negative review saying that he felt the price was too high for a single bed.  Fine, nothing to really be concerned about there.  People said the host was nice, that he made them breakfast, really no reason to think there was anything fishy going on.

I requested Thursday through Sunday (checkout on Sunday) through Airbnb, and the host accepted my request later that day.  I put in the comments (where it says to tell the host about yourself, and they encourage you to share why you are traveling) that I was in town for Pokémon Go Fest and would be gone most of the day, and just needed a place to sleep at night.  Arrived in Chicago, went to meet my host Thursday evening.  The Uber driver warned me that it wasn't the best place for an Airbnb and that it was one of the unsafer neighborhoods in Chicago.  Well OK, nice to know, but I really didn't have any options at this point.

Messaged the host that I was there, he came out to meet me and show me up to the room.  I took all of my belongings with me (I had a laptop worth about $2000, a suitcase with my Nintendo Switch among other things, phone chargers, clothes, medication), and said I would be back later, that I wanted to go get some dinner.  I asked him if there was a key for the place he could give me (as that's usually what Airbnb hosts have done at past trips I've taken, even if it *is* just for a single room and not the entire place), and he said he doesn't have a spare key, but to just message him when I need to be let in and he'll come open the door.  Again, he seemed friendly so I didn't think anything of it, and said I would be back later.

I got back, messaged him to let me in, and he came to open the door.  I went to bed, didn't talk to the guy at all.  He had the TV on all night, or at least until I fell asleep, I was lying in bed at 1:30am hearing his TV.

Next morning (Friday), I got up, showered, took my medication and left.  After all, that was the day of Go Fest, where I would be busy in the park from 9am-7pm.  The host knew this, I told him in my initial request to book that I would be gone all day.

So here I am in Grant Park at about 9:30, after just getting started with my day, when I got a message from Airbnb support.  They told me ""your host is no longer able to accommodate you, let me know when I can call and discuss this with you.""   Already pretty pissed off at this point as I was trying to enjoy my day, but I told them go ahead and call whenever.  I got a call from a ""resolution manager"" maybe 15 minutes after I sent that message, and the lady explained that, for whatever reason, the host was no longer able to host me and that, as compensation, they would give me a $200 voucher and give me links to other listings in the area.  Great, I said, but what about all of my stuff?  I'm *busy all day*, I can't just go get my suitcase and laptop, having nowhere to take the stuff, nor can I check into some Airbnb at 9:30 in the morning.  The lady said she'd check, and call me back.  She called back another 10-15 minutes later and said ""I talked to your host, he said he would be there all day so you can get your things when it's convenient."" I said great, then I won't leave the park and just go get my things after 7pm when the event is done.  I asked the lady if he gave a reason for cancelling my trip (at this time, I was too preoccupied to even ask *if he had a right to do this*, I just went along with it), and she said that he said something about ""not liking the communication"", whatever that means.  Um, okay.

Fast-forward to 12:30pm.  Host messages me through Airbnb (note that, the entire weekend I hadn't ever talked to the host outside of Airbnb - I had his number and he had mine, but I didn't receive any text messages from him or any calls, and I didn't message/call him either.  Given that the whole ""I don't have a key for you"" was already sketchy enough, I wanted all of my communications with him to be logged through Airbnb so their staff could see it in case of incident.) saying ""Your checkout time was noon and you didn't come to get your stuff.  I'm going to put it under the stairs."" I wrote back saying that Airbnb support told me you would be home all day, what are you talking about? My checkout time was noon *ON SUNDAY*, not in the middle of the day on Friday!  If he wanted to cut my trip short, that was on him, but he's not going to inconvenience me like this.  (okay, I didn't say all of that to him, just the first part about what support told me).  He wrote back saying ""I don't know what you two talked about but I definitely will not be home all day, I suggest you come get your stuff.""

Well, considering that the front door to the building locks, I figured my stuff was safe under the stairs, only tenants of that building would be getting in anyway, and if he wasn't home later I could probably ask one of the other tenants to open the door for me.

So around 6pm when I had a bit of a break, I looked for another Airbnb.  Found something much closer that cost more money, since they were giving me a $200 voucher after all - tried to book one, but the voucher wasn't working.  I called them and they said they'd ""look into it"", and I basically said look, I'm running out of time, just give me $200 back to my credit card and I'll get a hotel, I'm done dealing with you guys.  They agreed, under the condition that I gave them the hotel receipt.  So I booked a hotel.

Fast-forward to Friday night around 8:30pm.  Finished Go Fest, ate dinner, got an Uber over to the place.  I actually told the Uber driver I was going to get my stuff, and then need a ride to the hotel, he said he can just add a destination to our trip, and agreed to wait while I got my stuff.  The front door to the complex was locked, but the night before it had opened after I jiggled the knob a few times.  I'm standing there jiggling the knob and trying to push the door in when some lady gets out of her car with a young child.  She sees the Uber driver parked there watching me, asks him what's going on, he explains to her that he's waiting on me, etc etc.  This lady's naturally a bit spooked, as she sees some strange guy trying to, what looks like, break into her apartment building while someone in a car is waiting for them.  Definitely seems sketchy from her perspective.  I explain the situation to her and she's shocked that anyone would rent an Airbnb in that building, but she agrees to open the door for me.  I get in, look under the stairs, and my luggage isn't there.  Wanting answers immediately, I attempt to actually call my (former) host.  He doesn't answer.  She said she'd try to call since she lives across from him, I gave her the number - she calls, gets his voicemail, leaves a message.  Oh, and meanwhile the Uber driver alerted me that someone else was added to his queue so he has to leave.  I say thanks for the ride and that I'll book another when I'm ready.  Now I'm by myself. 
 While we're waiting for a call back, I walk up to her apartment (which is directly across from his) - as she handed me a couple gallons of milk to carry for her while she unlocked the door for me.  I set the milk down in her apartment and, just for the heck of it, I open the Tile app on my phone.

Before I continue my story, let me explain real quickly what Tile is and what it does.  Tile is a small tracking device that you can attach to objects that you think you might misplace - in my case, my car keys and wallet.  I have one in my wallet and one on my key ring.  If your phone is within Bluetooth range of these devices, you can make them play music to help you find the device - and if you ever lose it, the app will tell you where it's last seen.

So, anyway - much to my surprise, the Tile app tells me *that my keyring is in range right now*!  Literally, as I'm standing outside the guy's apartment that I can't get into, my car keys (which were in my luggage) are within a few hundred feet of my phone!  The guy calls her back and says ""look, I told the guest this too, I put his stuff under the stairs, if it's gone then someone probably stole it and it's his fault for not coming and getting it when I told him to."" She relays the message to me, but I say no... that's not true, the stuff is here *right now*, and I show her my phone.  She tells him this, and I hear loud yelling over the phone.  He starts cussing her out, saying it's none of her [expletive] business, and hangs up.  Okay, now I'm starting to get the picture.  He probably saw this as a great opportunity - I said in my notes that I would be gone all day for an event, he sees that I have valuable items, what a great idea!  He can end my stay early, *know I can't get my stuff because I'm gone at an event*, CLAIM he put it out for me and ""oh, it's gone, someone must have stolen it"".  Meanwhile, he pockets all this valuable loot that he can do whatever with.  Except... he wasn't planning on me being able to prove that my belongings were in his apartment that night when he wasn't home.  As soon as she tells him this, he flips out, realizing I'm onto him.  The lady calls the landlord.  Landlord comes out, I explain this all to him.  He advises me to file a police report.  Says that even though he has the key and *can* let me enter his apartment, he doesn't have the legal right to do so, and that the tenant (my Airbnb host) could try to sue *him* for illegal entry.  The landlord also puts a notice on the guy's door, saying he's going to evict him, that it's totally against his lease to let guests stay there.  He was appalled that the place was even listed on Airbnb.

We called the police, waited about half an hour for them to show up, making small talk in the meantime.  He told me he was gonna evict the guy soon anyway because of how shady he is, and that this whole Airbnb thing suddenly makes sense, because the guy was always late paying the rent and kept coming up short, but that mysteriously a couple months ago he was able to pay it (after the landlord threatened to evict).  I keep telling the guy, look, that's all well and dandy but I just want my stuff back.  I do understand where he's coming from, and that's why I was glad to wait for the police.  If police can write up a warrant and let me in, great!  But after about half an hour of waiting, he said ""let's just go down to the station"" so he drives me there.

I run this by them, the cops basically say they can't issue a warrant off of that alone and that I have to attempt to get my stuff back directly from the person first, then I can file a report if he doesn't comply, *then* they can do something.  So the landlord tells me - the guy's usually home Saturday mornings.  Call him, call the police, they'll go up together and see what they can do.

So I'm staying completely empty handed at a hotel Friday night, hoping I can resolve this matter in the morning.

Saturday morning comes, I do exactly as instructed.  Call landlord, call police.  Police escorts come out, landlord comes out a bit later.  I call the host, who of course does not answer, so landlord gets his spare key and we start walking up to the place - me, landlord, and an officer.  Knock on the door, no reply.  Police knocks and says they're the cops, here with landlord and guest, the man opens the door ajar (leaving it chained so they couldn't force entry), starts filming and making this whole spiel about illegal entry and how they're infringing his rights.  He says to me ""I messaged you lots of times and you ignored me"", I say no you didn't, I don't have a single text from you and only the one message from Airbnb and he says ""that's bulls*** and you know it"".  I say fine, show me your phone then where you sent me texts, and of course he refuses because that's not true at all.  The cop basically says look, at this point you tried, but you'll have to file a report for stolen belongings, we can't break into this guy's place.  Meanwhile, I'm checking my phone while standing in front of his apartment like the night before, and the Tile shows it's no longer there.  Says it was last seen 10:30pm Friday night (when we left to wait on the cops).

So, the guy moved my stuff elsewhere after realizing we were onto him, also took the notice off his door.  The landlord gave me all the information I needed to file my police report, and asked if he could see the Airbnb listing just to see what I even agreed to with the guy.

Would it shock anyone at this point when I learned that he used a fake name on Airbnb?  The name I had for him wasn't even his real name.  Huge surprise. /s

So anyway, I give the officer all this info, they write up a report.  I give them the itemized list of what was stolen, they estimate it at around $3000 (I actually forgot to tell them about my Switch at this point), give me a ""victim notice"" and say an investigator will follow up with me in a week or so.  Well, great, I won't even be there in a week, and he can easily sell my stuff before any of those serials I gave the cops get registered anywhere!

I called Airbnb about this.  I said first of all, I didn't think hosts could just cancel a stay like that and kick a guest out.  They said ""they can't..."" and the guy on the phone said ""your stay wasn't cancelled at all, it shows a confirmed reservation from June 13-14 with you checking out on the 14th at noon."" I said NO, that's not it, look at my original confirmation.  He checks and says ""oh, huh, I see that now."" Digs into it and apparently some supervisor overrode something that should not have been overridden, as it shows in the Airbnb app that I consented to the altered stay (I did not, and was simply *told*).  I don't know what lies he told the Airbnb support people, but they somehow got their managers to override this and alter my trip to say I was checking out on the 14th instead of the 16th.

So at this point I'm considering my goods lost, and I called Airbnb again and asked if there was any way they can take money from the guy (after all, if they deposit money into his bank account when people book stays with him, they can take it out too...) to reimburse me the $3000 he stole from me.  They said ""you can do that, but you have to fill out a request"" and they sent me a link.  The link only lets me request $87 back (one nights' stay, the other two were auto-refunded when the trip was altered).  I explain this to them, and they said ""just request the $87 back, the guy's not going to do it anyway, then after 72 hours you can escalate it to our claims division and they can go from there."" Needless to say I'm less than pleased with Airbnb's support by now, I've talked to several different ""case resolution managers"" who all just keep giving me links to things within the app, and none of them assuring me they will ban the guy from Airbnb for being a fraud and stealing from his guests.

I sent the guy a message through Airbnb saying, just FYI I gave the police all the serial numbers of what you stole, and I have GPS tracking on my items should you try to sell them (the second part isn't entirely true, since Tile requires a phone to be in-range of it to actually get the location.  Since Friday night it hasn't been picked up by any phones.  But he's not going to know that!) I said I'd be willing to drop the police report and Airbnb claim I filed against him if he returns my stuff (again, not true, I'm absolutely still keeping that police report open) No reply of course, so I text him the same message.  Still no reply.

Sunday morning I figure what the heck, I'll try one last time.  I said something along the lines of ""If you don't return my belongings, I will sue you for at least $3000 which is the value of the items you stole from me.""  Short and sweet.  He messaged back ""I filed a police report against you for phone harassment, don't contact me again""

I called the non-emergency police number and explained this all to them.  The lady said his supposed police report was complete bogus and that sending two messages asking for my stolen items back is absolutely not harassment, that it wouldn't hold up in court at all.  But either way, it's clear he's not going to return my stuff.

I'm now back in Michigan without any of my belongings.  The guy's probably going to try to sell my stuff.  He's also probably being evicted from his apartment but that doesn't help me in the slightest.

Airbnb is still ""working on the case and will contact you as soon as we can"", and I'm not expecting to hear anything from the police investigator for a week.

The lady at the police did say I can hire a lawyer in Michigan to sue the man in Chicago and not have to actually travel back to Chicago myself.  Though I'm not sure I'd trust that, I want to testify against the guy myself.

However, I've also never taken anyone to court before.  Only times I've ever been to court were for jury duty and to contest traffic tickets.  Hence why I'm asking for advice.  What can I really do at this point?  I've Googled the subject and most people are saying Airbnb just tells people to sue in incidents like this, they aren't a hotel and their insurance is to protect *hosts* from unruly *guests* and not vice-versa.  So I'm really not thinking they'll do anything either, and the guy's listings are still up as well.  Half tempted to hire someone else to book the place and go looking for my stuff, lol.

But seriously, what should I do?  Just sit and wait?  Hire a lawyer? Any advice is really appreciated.

A friend suggested I should sue for more than just what my stuff is worth, because of emotional trauma from the ordeal.  I believe the limit for small claims court is $5000, so I'm considering asking for the max.

tl;dr Airbnb host who knew I would be gone and unable to come for my belongings bent rules and ended my stay early, kept all my items in his apartment and lied to me saying he left them out for me to collect.  Tried to play it off as someone else stealing them, freaked when I confronted him on the lie and now refuses to cooperate with police nor give my stuff back.",legaladvice
"Can we successfully sue someone ""advertising"" items on our property?","My father lives on an 18-acre wooded property in Oregon that he and I jointly own (I live in California). He's into classic car restoration and started collecting ""barn finds"" over 20 years ago. Today he has more than 40 vehicles on the property, mostly in barns and old chicken coops, but all relatively well cared for. Most are classic cars worth non-trivial amounts of money (old Fords and Hudsons, 1960's muscle cars, that sort of thing), and he's whiling away his retirement years pulling the cars out one by one to restore and sell off.

About a year ago he started noticing small thefts from some of the cars. Hubcaps started vanishing, engine parts would disappear from previously running cars, one car had its interior partially stripped. He initially assumed that it was local thieves until a couple of months ago when he caught a couple of videographers going through one of his barns, documenting everything inside of it. While they waited for the sheriff to arrive (at gunpoint, FWIW), the videographers explained that they'd learned about the property through a ""barn finds"" auto blog and discussion board. Apparently, the property had been ""found"" about 18 months previously, was described as abandoned and had been visited a number of times by the members of this barn finds forum. They also solved a mystery. About six months prior, my dad had found some deep muddy ruts on an abandoned access road at the back of the property. We learned that a group of these guys had tried to ""rescue"" a very valuable and collectible car stored in one of the outbuildings, but had got stuck in the mud and had been planning on trying again. 

The property is now VERY well marked with signs prohibiting access, and we've re-strung the barbed wire fences around the perimeter. My dad also felled three trees to block some of the old access roads on the side and rear of the property to prevent any additional ""rescue attempts"". 

Our problem is that the original website STILL has the information online including detailed photos of everything we have on the property. They are still listing the exact location of the land, including directions about how to approach it to ""avoid neighbors"", but have added a few comments about ""an angry old man living in a neighboring house who is trying to claim the abandoned property and derelict cars"". Since catching the trespassers, our fences have been cut three times, a number of additional parts have vanished (including an irreplaceable steering wheel from a 1938 Mercedes Benz), and the barns have been forcibly broken into several times.

So here's my question. Because this all started when the blogs primary authors trespassed on our property, documented our cars, and falsely labeled them as ""abandoned"", and because they continue to list them on their website, is there any chance that we could successfully sue them and recover some of the losses we've experienced over the past year? Between the new fence, signage, and the value of the lost parts, he estimates that we're probably out more than $15,000 at this point. We've identified the owner of the blog and believe that he has the financial resources to pay a judgment, but I'm not sure whether it's worth the effort. I personally know two lawyers. One is telling me to sue their arse off, and the other is telling me that we'd be wasting our time and money.

Mechanic said it would take 2 weeks to fix my car. It's been 3 months and now he says he wants more than what we agreed on or he'll transfer the title over to him.,"I live in Washington State.

My car broke down in April and I couldn't afford to take it to a shop. Luckily the AAA tow truck driver said he had experience rebuilding my specific car and could do it for way cheaper $400. I paid him $100 at the start then another $100 after 3 weeks. Every time I asked how close it was he would never tell me a definite answer. Something always came up. Just last night he said he finally got it done. But now he wants $300 instead of the $200 and he said he will transfer the title over to him if I don't pay that amount. 

Is he even able to do that? I feel like I shouldn't have to pay more seeing that he had my car for so long.

Thanks!

Update: Went to go check out the car. Waited 30 min for him to put the intake and oil in which he said he had already did the night before. He started the car and it just blew a ton of burning oil smoke and made an even worse clicking noise than it did before I even brought it to him. 

His excuse was that he ""didn't hear that before"" so he didn't know it was a problem. He then said that he would replace the engine for free as long as I gave him the $300 and brought him a new engine.

I talked with a cop as well and he said there wasn't much I could do since he hasn't actually stolen it yet.

Update 2: Ended up paying him $160 and towed the car out. Also called AAA and reported it with them. Thanks everyone for all the advice!",legaladvice
[MN] My ex-wife opened a credit card in my name ($2000 balance) to start selling makeup through a MLM scheme.,"We divorced back in January and it was fairly amicable, no kids and no spousal support. Since then, I learned she lost her job and had to move back in with her parents. I received a letter yesterday from a collection agency. On it is a credit card I've never had before and an ""offer"" to pay off the $2000+ balance for $1700. I called the number and asked what the hell it was about. After a couple minutes of back and forth, I learned one of the addresses they had in their system for my account came back to my ex-wife's parents' house. At this point I'm livid. I hung up and immediately called her.

I asked her if she opened a credit card in my name and I got a long-winded story about how she was going to start her own makeup consultancy business with a pyramid scheme company since she had to move back home. She needed to pay for the initial product, marketing materials and a car wrap. It cost her about $1700. Her ""plan"" was to use the money she was going to make to pay off the credit card and close the account. She can't get a credit card due to some really bad financial decisions she made in her early 20s (she's in her late 20s now).

Unsurprisingly (to me) nobody wanted to buy the makeup and she had no way of paying the credit card so she didn't even try making a single payment. I laughed at how absurd it was, hung up, and sent her mom and dad a text about it and haven't heard anything back. At this point, would I need to sue her to get my money back or would that be pointless since she has no assets of her own?",legaladvice

TX- Disgruntled ex employee came back to work a week ago and stabbed me. I am being fired because of it.,"I just now got out of the hospital. Last monday on the 28th, I had an old employee we let go on friday come in. Now this is not unusual as people generally forgot things when they leave. I asked him what he was doing here. 

He said he needed to talk to me about what happened. This guy was let go for budget reasons. Simple as that. We cut 5 employees and he unfortunately made the cut. 

I informed him that there was no real reason why he was let go. Just a business decision and that we would have glowing letters of recommendation for him, will not interfere with unemployment, and will actually give good references for everyone who called. 

This point he claims its bullshit and gets hostile. I try to calm him down as does many other workers nearby. His friend tried to say he would take him to lunch and pay. Basically everyone knew he needed to leave at this point. 

He seemed to calm down, but then pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed me in the stomach. I did not even realize I had been stabbed yet as I saw the knife and reacted. I grabbed his arm and held it firmly. The adrenaline was running through me so much I did not realize I had been stabbed yet until I saw the blood. I started to panic and punched him with my free hand in the jaw a few times. I guess one of them hit home as he dropped to the ground. 

I sat down in on the ground holding the knife in me as I knew it was probably the only thing keeping me from bleeding out. The other workers that were there held him down until the police arrived. The ambulance took me and I went in for surgery. 

Today i receive a phone call that I do not have to return to work. I told my boss that I would be ready for light duty on monday. He said that my health was not what he meant. One of the HR guys saw me punch the fired worker a few times and said that my face was like ""A vicious animal."" Exact words. 

I told my boss that this was to be expected when fight or flight kicks in. He agreed with me and said that he wished he did not have to do this. But that everyone who got physical with the former employee will probably be let go pending a review by legal. 

This will make me lose my insurance. I am worried about continuing medical issues. The stab wound is still infected, but I have been given both pills and a cream for this. 

I am mainly worried about losing the job. Is there any kind of suit I can bring up if I am fired for this? I know you can sue someone for anything you want, I am asking about suits that would have a reasonable chance of winning given a good lawyer. 

Also is it legal for my job to fire me and the guys who helped over this? The guy was only out for maybe half a minute so he was still a danger. It took the police 12 minutes to show up. Hello the ambulance was forced to wait outside for 5 minutes until the police showed up to secure the situation. This guy had plenty of time to harm other people. How can a job just up and fire everyone like this? Im guessing yes because texas, but is this even legal?",legaladvice
"Am I Obligated To Honor Previous ""Verbal Agreements"" Made From A Business I Inherited?","I'll try to keep this as black and white as possible...

I unexpectedly inherited a Marina in NY 3 years ago after the sudden and out of the blue death of a family member.  Over the past 3 years I've pretty much been trying to decipher the whole business and put together everything in a way that's more manageable for me to run.

The biggest issue I've had has been; it seems everyone ""had a deal"" with my family member for a discounted slip (boat parking space) and at first I was honoring those deals as to keep good relations with all the customers.  I found out that a few people have taken advantage of this and stretched the truth and even completely fabricate deals.  Taking advantage of my goodwill and naivety.

With the new season about to begin,  after being burned a few times, I have decided to put my foot down and say any deals that were made under previous ownership will only be honored with a written agreement.  This has made one customer of mine livid and he's been constantly and inappropriately bothering me about how the deal he made has already been agreed upon.  *Not by me but from my dead family member*.  

I don't have any written evidence but a long-time employee, who I trust very much, told me recently that the deal the customer made with my family member was only for one year.  He's now received the same deal (more than half off on a slip in exchange from some old equipment that I don't even use) for the 4 years (one when my family member was alive, 3 since I took over).  My family member took a ton of notes and seemingly wrote everything on his mind down, either on his phone or in notepads/random pieces of paper.  I haven't found ANYTHING about this deal.

Trying to take my anger and emotion of being lied to and taken advantage of; I told him for me to continue honoring the deal I need something in writing between the two of them that gives details and dates of the ""deal"".  Is this legal?  Do I have to honor deals that I never verbally agreed to? Are there any ramifications that I'm not thinking of by terminating verbal agreements that I had nothing to do with?  What about written ones?  Can I tell him he's no longer welcome at the marina (contractually I have that right)? Where should I go from here?  He's essentially dooped me for 5-6 thousand dollars.  I'm just trying to do the right thing, but I don't want to be taken advantage of or get in any legal trouble.",legaladvice
"[CA] Grandma helped me set up a stock account in her name, I made a large profit and now she's saying the money is hers","**EDIT: Please stop messaging me asking for investment advice, I've got 500+ messages asking the same thing.**


So about 2 years ago when I was 15, my grandma helped me setup a stock account  under her name because I was interested in stocks. I deposited more money into the account over the years, totaling about $700. I've been messing with pennystocks the entire time and while I had some bad losses,I've made a very good profit. I'm not going to specify but the account is worth several tens of thousands now. 

Last week I was visiting my grandma and she asked me how the stock account was going (I don't visit her very often and shes never asked before), and she was shocked when I told her how much I made. She suddenly told me that it was in her name, it was her account, and it was her money. I was super confused but we got into an argument and I ended up leaving. I've talked to my parents and they talked to her about it, and apparently they got into an argument too. 

She is insisting that the money is hers, the account is under her name but I put all of the money in it, and did all the trades under the impression that she was letting me use an account under her name, then we'd change the account to my name when I turned 18. I am now 17, turning 18 in 7 months. 

Yesterday I got an email that the bank account was changed and I checked and all the money was gone. I don't know how she got it because she didn't know the password, I'm guessing she contacted support or something?

I reached out to a lawyer, who drafted me a response free of charge to send back to the TSA.  I questioned his verbiage as it looked to me like I was apologizing for everything and admitting guilt.  He responded saying that yes, you are apologizing (and asking for a warning instead of a fine), but nowhere in the e-mail are you admitting guilt.  


He further stated that this is the best course of action for now and that he was 99% sure they would drop it and just give me a warning.  But should they come back with an actual fine, to contact him back for official representation.


I received the response today, and they gave me a warning.  No fine.  I am so incredibly relieved.  I know a lot of you encouraged me to sue the TSA and whatnot, but I am overjoyed that this is finally behind me.   I did have some definite fault in what transpired, and won't make that mistake again.  I do think there was some significant negligence on the TSA's part that I could have taken some action on, but frankly, I'm glad it didn't come to that.

My arts school claims that everything created while using their WiFi belongs to them. Is this legal?,"I go to a school in Pennsylvania that has a heavy focus on the arts. They provide internet to us students, and they also provide laptops. 
Apparently everything created using the school's WiFi belongs to the school. To me this seems awfully exploitative considering they make every effort to keep students from using anything else. Especially in an arts school where they teach primarily minors, many of whom are unaware of this rule.
So I've got a  few questions; Is this legal? How does the legality change if I'm using a personal device, VPN, mobile network, or combination of these? Many students' art has been sold and published by the students. Is *this* legal, or does it nullify the school ownership?

Edit: I went to the administration office and requested a copy of the ""Acceptable Use Policy"" cited by the Student Handbook. Here's the link:

AUP https://imgur.com/a/NwoY6G0

Acceptable Use Policy 

To avoid doxxing myself I've censored my name and the name of the school. Some interesting points: 
1) The document was signed in 2016. I was, at this time, under fourteen years old. This document may also be outdated, but I have not signed any similar document since.

1.1) Even though I was so young, my mother signed an identical document at this time.

~~2) There's a clause that states ""I understand that the Technology Resources provided to me may be protected under copyright law..."" Is this the relevant phrase?~~
As u/Sylvan graciously pointed out, this clause is in reference to licensed programs or materials provided by the school:
""They're saying if the school provides software (eg. volume lisenced MS Office or Adobe Creative Suite), or course materials like online textbooks or references, you agree not to copy it elsewhere.""



Edit: A point I forgot to add. The school may have updated their policy since 2016. They decided (rather inconveniently) this year to go paperless. They didn't explain the policy to us this year, they just told us something like ""You know the rules by now.""

Yet another edit: To clarify, I still don't have all of the pertinent documents. I remember a far more in-depth document discussing school technology policy, and I'm searching for this document now. I am going to ask around and tomorrow I will ask the teachers where they got their information.",legaladvice
[Update] I think my mom is going to try to kill my grandmother and make it look like suicide.,"I wanted to thank the r/legaladvice community and give an update to [my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9sudc9/i_think_my_mom_is_going_to_try_to_kill_my/) from about 4 months ago. For privacy purposes as this is an ongoing situation, this post will be fairly short and vague.

Last month my grandmother was admitted to the ICU in respiratory failure. She pulled through, but with the help of my aunts, uncles and cousins we determined (with evidence) that my mom has been both neglecting my grandmother's medical needs and drugging my grandmother without her knowledge. Although she wouldn't outright say it to me, it turns out that my mother had been insisting to my cousins that my grandmother was suicidal, and even tried to keep pushing the 'she wants to kill herself' narrative while my grandmother was hospitalized. We believe that she may have even attempted to OD my grandmother at the hospital, but her plan was thwarted by ever-present relatives. As an aside, we did alert the hospital of the situation and unfortunately were told they couldn't do anything because ""it's a family matter"". Everything is now in the hands of my aunt, who's working with a lawyer to address the situation in the least stressful way for my grandmother. Thank you all for your advice and support on my last post, and I'm so glad that my grandmother is still with us. I truly believed that this situation would only end in tragedy, but it seems fate had different plans. My grandmother is still in the care of my mother for the moment (with relatives checking in daily), and while my mother is not yet aware that my family knows of *everything* she's been doing, she does at least know that her siblings are seeking to change the POA and insurance benefits out of her name, and has since completely changed her tune about my grandmother's mental health. Otherwise, my grandmother is home and doing well, and is under the close eye of her children, doctors and social worker while my family works out where to go from here. Thank you all again.

OP here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9t4514/abusive_exboyfriend_is_threatening_to_sue_over_a/

Thanks to everyone for the advice, quite a bit has happened since my first post.

I ignored him and continued doing what I was doing, then a few days after I posted he showed up at the bar while I wasn't there and asked around for me. They said he seemed drunk (which is unfortunate as he allegedly got sober after our breakup) and they told him to fuck off and called me to warn me. 

Before I could even react to that, he contacted several people at my work via social media, including one person very high up in upper management who barely knows who I am. He sent them all the same opener, saying he was trying to reach out to me and asked for my phone number or email and saying it was urgent. Two of my colleagues responded to this message that I know of, both said something to the effect that they wouldn't be able to share my info but they'd let me know he asked. He then began threatening them and ""warning"" them about me and telling them very sexually explicit things about me and asking if they were sure I was the type of person they wanted to work with. 

I was really, really trying to avoid asking anyone at work for help even though I knew they would be nice about it. I didn't want to be the person that drags their drama into the office, but my ex did it for me, so I decided it couldn't hurt at this point to consult with a friendly coworker in legal to see what she thinks. She walked me through getting a restraining order and put me in touch with an attorney that practices in this arena if I end up needing it - I really hope not to.

Literally two days after the TRO was granted and he had been served, he showed up at the bar again, drunk again, and this time I was there. It was honestly really surreal seeing him. They kicked him out but he loitered outside and refused to leave and the bartender and my friends and some random strangers were all guarding the door, it was quite the debacle, we called the cops and he was arrested.

So, I think I'm in the clear for now, although I know he's willing to break the law so I'm not incredibly comfortable. I put up cameras in my apartment, my friends are walking me out to the car every night (I used to walk alone, it's a safe enough area it was never a concern before), my employer and colleagues are aware and supportive even though I wish I could've kept this private. I'm doing what I can. There wasn't a huge dramatic ending to all of this but it seems like it should be over now - here's hoping. Thank you again for the advice and support everyone!",legaladvice

A mother trying to control her son's... Alone time.,"I'm 15. My family is deeply religious. I respect that but sometimes, yknow, I'm 15, and I have to, you know, rub one out. I try not to but like... I can't concentrate on anything else if I don't. And like if I see a pretty girl it'll get worse. It basically feels like sleeping to me, if I don't do it I can't function. Idk if I'm normal or not. I'm definitely ashamed of it. But I'm not lying I promise. My mom doesn't believe me. My dad is out of the picture so I can't talk to him and ask him if this is a guy thing.

Anyway my mom has tried a lot of things to get me to stop. She took my door off, for example. She grounded me and stuff. I try to hide it so she gives up but now she's decided to get some kind of device and put it on me so that I can't touch myself. She seemed serious and it wouldn't be out of character for her. She also does other weird things like on Fridays we can't eat at all because of Jesus. I try to respect that but often times I go out on a bike ride and get food somewhere. I get hungry.

What I want to know is can I refuse to wear her device? I pretty much know I will lose my phone (she'll probably sell it so I can't get it back) and stuff if I refuse but I personally think that going a while without my phone is kinda fine. I want my grades go stay OK so that I can get into college and have some control over myself and I can't do that if I'm constantly hot and bothered by every girl I see cuz, well you know.

[Update] An employee has obtained a personal video of me and is showing it to others.,"Since [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az3vqw/an_employee_has_obtained_a_personal_video_of_me/) gained some attention I'm posting an update. 

After I submitted the post on Saturday I called my director. He has been my mentor and a trusted friend since I started at the company three years ago, and was already aware that the relationship between myself and my ex was a thing that happened. I'd been told that my employee had gone directly to him, I'm assuming to smear me, so I knew I had to speak to him about it directly. I was expecting an I-told-you-so type conversation, but he was kind, understanding, and completely nonjudgmental. He told me he doesn't look at me any differently and no one else does either who matters. He also made my decision about whether or not to go to HR much easier. Since he's a director and she brought it to him he was obligated to report it. This was basically the best case scenario for me. I'd had several of her friends come to me and ask me not to go to HR and to let her work it out of her system. Now I can say that the decision to bring it to them was completely out of my hands. 

I got a phone call from HR this morning asking me to report immediately to them. I asked if I could go to my building first to clock in and change, and they told me nope - ASAP. I sat down with them and they were also totally kind and completely nonjudgmental and supportive. They got the full story, the names of everyone involved, and asked a lot of good questions. They also confirmed what commentors on the last post told me, that I'd done nothing wrong and had nothing to be ashamed of. They even told me that they will do whatever they can to protect my reputation as the investigation moves forward. From what I've heard both the AVP and the Director of HR have dedicated their entire day today to interviews with people so I feel confident that this is being handled as it should. 

They called her in this afternoon to get her story and suspended her with pay pending the investigation. As an aside, as my manager drove her to the corporate office for the meeting she told him how she's ""the real victim here."" The mental gymnastics just totally baffles me. I've been advised to document everything, including any interactions with her friends, in case there is any hostile workplace environment concerns. 

**TL;DR: HR is handling the situation, the woman in question has been suspended pending the investigation, and I'm being protected. Good update all around.** ",legaladvice
"[Update] Neighbour damaged their car pulling into my driveway - want us to pay for ""repairs"" [Ontario Canada]","Original post - https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aadtxw/neighbour_damaged_their_car_pulling_into_my/

It's been about a week since the issue came up and I thought I would post an update.

I ended up going to speak with them the following day to tell them about the trespass. I also gave them a letter stating the same thing. It's just something I made up based on suggestions here and what I found on the internet. They seemed a little surprised and didn't say much other than I should expect to here from their attorney.

So far, we haven't heard from anyone lawyer wise.

For a short time, I felt like the problem was resolved as nobody used our driveway. This all changed yesterday (Friday, exactly a week since the incident) when my neighbour pulled into my driveway as I was clearing ice from it. He smiled, waved and reversed into his driveway. I did manage to take a photo as I shook my head ""no"" at him. They used our driveway at least 2 other times in the evening after dark that we know about.

I called the non-emergency police number this morning to report the trespassing and the call taker told me someone would contact us soon. At this point, I think I would be surprised if the police did anything based on what I'll mention later in my text.

I have also pursued this in two other ways. First, the bylaw folks did get back in touch with me to tell me that there was no bylaw stating others couldn't use my driveway. They also said that I'm well within my rights to put anything I want in my driveway anywhere as long as it's not a permanent structure. I also learned that blocking my driveway from the street is not permitted and that anything within 1.5m on either side of the driveway is considered blocking. Bylaw said the damage to the car is a civil matter and has nothing to do with them (not surprised there).

Lastly, I tried to find out if I own the driveway all the way to the road. This has been an exercise in frustration to be honest. Right now, the only thing I know for sure is the following;

>City right-of-way

>This term refers to the City-owned portion of a piece of land.  It is very often wider than the road and sidewalks that may abut your property and can extend to a considerable extent onto your property.  The City maintains a right-of-way wider than the width of the road in the event that a road widening becomes necessary at some point in the future.

>Notwithstanding this, a property owner is still responsible for maintaining the City-owned portion of their land, with respect to matters such as grass cutting and snow clearance.  The exact extent of the City's right-of-way can be determined through a Plan of Survey.

This leads me to believe the city does own a piece of the driveway but I don't know how much and if this means my neighbour can use it. The fact that they began using it again a week after my visit leads me to believe they have found out that they are free to use it.

At this point, we are trying to decide if we drop it or go all in and hire our own attorney. Someone from the planning department of the city is going to be calling us back next week (I hope).

Thanks to everyone for all the great advice.

Cheers.",legaladvice

Good Morning, guys. This is an uplifting update. 
 
First of all, I'd like to thank all of you guys for such an overwhelming response.I'm glad that there are people who would spend time from their busy life to help a random stranger on Internet. :) 
 
So, After reading all of advises here and carefully discussing this matter with my cousin, we made a nasty plan. Yesterday night that squatter girl went outside to grab some dinner with her bf. Me and my cousin carefully packed all of her stuffs in her three bag left in in our front porch and locked ourselves in house. We also looked over her stuffs from window to make sure no one steals it. 
 
Our wait was over after 2 hours when girl returned. She figured it out and started pounding at our door, yelling loudly to open door, you know typical squatter drama. We told her to go fuck off and we won't open the door. So, finally after 30 minutes of constant drama, she dared to call cops. I was nervous how it would turn out. 
 
Cops arrived. Fortunately these were different ones than previous night. First they listened to her side. Then they came to me. I explicitly told them that I was sole owner of house and never allowed girl to stay more than 1 night. She was not only trespassing but also living in my house illegally without my permission. Bitch kept saying I had given permission to stay there indefinitely and now kicking her out. Officer said she has any proof of that? She claimed she had some message which accidentally got deleted. 
  
Now the best part, Officer then asked her for an ID. She gave ID. Officer verified it over Radio. Suddenly, they told him this bitch had a failure to appear warrant for months old shoplifting case. Stupid lady was arrested immediately. His stuffs were send to friend's house. Officer said that I don't need to worry and they'll take care of her. I do not require any further action. 
  
So, Finally I'm relived from that squatter and bitch is behind bars. What a justice boner! 
 
All's well that ends well. :)
 
TL, DR: Previously there was bad cop, then comes good cop and justice is served. :)

[PA] I was just fired for refusing to give vaccinations as a receptionist,"I am certified in PA as a CMAA (Certified Medical Administrative Assistant) and my boss knows this. My official job title on hire was ""Medical Receptionist"".

She started pushing me recently to do height and weight because the office is under-staffed. She pushed another receptionist into calling in medication which I found out is illegal in the state. I refused to do this.

She became angry with me and her tone changed about a month ago. 

When she demanded I start doing flu shots, I declined. I was sick last week and had to call off. She called me in this morning and asked why I refused to do the vaccinations. I told her I am not certified and she fired me on the spot stating I ""miss too much work"".

I am only concerned about moving on at this point and concerned about UC. I heard she has done this to other receptionists and made sure they did not get paid their final pay and did not collect unemployment when the dispute letter arrived. One girl even sued this woman and won. She is the office manager for a foreign doctor.

My landlord shut off the electricity in the middle of a heat wave,"We are in New York. Electricity is included in our rent. Yesterday, the landlord put notices on our doors warning that our power consumption was ""unreasonable"" (trying to survive 100+ degree heat in a very poorly insulated building with no central AC will do that, I guess). She threatened to ""suspend service temporarily"" if we continued. The notice started with ""attention residents"" and I saw identical papers on some other doors, so I assume it was directed at all tenants.

2 hours ago she followed through with her threat. The power is out in my apartment. The hallways and stairs are barely lit. My landlord is not answering her phone.

What can I do? With the kind of person she is, I'm worried that she'll just wait for the end of the extreme heat, evade consequences by turning the power back on, and pull this shit again in the next heat wave.",legaladvice
(Minnesota) My boss took my car and drove it home from work because his was in the shop and I got fired for reporting it stolen,"Not trolling I swear. If this wasn't happening to me I wouldn't even believe it. My location is the state of Minnesota and I'm looking for advice because I have no idea what to do next.

While I was at work my car disappeared from the parking lot outside my office. The office I work at is the only building that uses the lot. I reported my car stolen but later realized that I couldn't find the keys and I told the police that as well. The next day my boss was pulled over driving my car. He has told the police that I lent him my car because his was in the shop. I didn't lend it to him and he never even asked me if he could borrow it. I told the police I didn't lend it to him. He now says he assumed he could take my car while his was out of commission and that he took the keys out of my purse. He has been charged with stealing my car and now he has a lawyer and won't say anything else. I have also been fired from my job by my bosses boss and the company owner. The reason on my letter of dismissal was for showing disloyalty to the company. My bosses boss says I need to learn how things work in the professional world. I worked there for a year and it's the only job I've had since graduating college and they aren't going to give me a reference and my unemployment application was denied because I was fired for misconduct.

Got a text from a former coworker saying our old boss has been opening credit cards in employees' names for the last couple of years.

Daughter threatened with expulsion over t-shirt update,"This isn't much of an update, but people have been asking. I edited my original post because it went viral and I didn't want my daughter to be doxxed. I certainly didn't want to expose her to the cruelty that comes with such viral stories.

Once this story started floating around the district, the superintendent connected the dots and jumped on it pretty quickly. The principal was quietly replaced and the boys were disciplined. My daughter was not punished and the superintendent actually apologized to her for everything that happened.

[UPDATE][UTAH] Sheep farmer trying to have therapy dog put down.,"I few weeks ago I posted this...

&#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bqkxrd/utah\_sheep\_farmer\_trying\_to\_have\_therapy\_dog\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bqkxrd/utah_sheep_farmer_trying_to_have_therapy_dog_put/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I work at a residential facility for youth in custody.

&#x200B;

We have a dog on site.

&#x200B;

Dog is directly supervised by staff 24/7 just like the clients.

&#x200B;

Dog is either locked inside with us, or tied outside with us.

&#x200B;

Someone came to our facility claiming witnesses state that our dog killed one of their sheep.

&#x200B;

I tell them to kick rocks.

&#x200B;

A few hours later, someone from the city comes threatening to take the dog.

&#x200B;

I tell them they cant prove it was this dog.

&#x200B;

They tell us to work it out with the sheep owner.

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

Ok, a few weeks went by and we didnt hear from the sheep owner again. My boss, the actual owner of the dog, was happy to just let it go, but he was worried that this time was passing because they were preparing some sort of legal action, so he did finally get in touch with them.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago, they told us they had checked out the sheep and it was not going to make it.

&#x200B;

Now, they tell us they cannot produce a sheep. Ok, its been a few weeks. The remains are probably disposed of by now.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago they say they had taken pics of the damage.

&#x200B;

Now they tell us they cannot produce the pics.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago they tell us they have an eyewitness, later changed to multiple eyewitnesses.

&#x200B;

Now we find out it was one guy who reported it from work. He does not work within view of their field. He works at a city dump right next door to our facility and who has a history or verbally abusing our residents (telling them they should be penned in like animals, theyre rapists, homos, etc).

&#x200B;

Anyways, we started pushing the issue and we find out that this guy who works next door to us is in a bad mood one day and just decides he hates our kids more than normal. Maybe he decides they dont deserve a dog. I dont know. At any rate, he calls up a nearby sheep owner and tells them he saw our dog kill a sheep.

&#x200B;

They couple who own the sheep are so worked up they dont even go to their field to check it out. They come straight over here and start mouthing off. I tell them our dog never leaves the facility and it cant be our dog. They say theyll be back with police and leave.

&#x200B;

They then go to their field and find out there is no dead sheep. Instead of owning up to their error, they double down and call the city. Perhaps keeping up the act to save face.

&#x200B;

Police told them they dont have sufficient evidence so they called animal control. Animal control comes and I tell them they cant prove it was this dog. This dog never leaves the facility. Its always either locked inside or staked outside.

&#x200B;

The city leaves and we never hear from the couple again until we get in touch with them and piece all this together.

&#x200B;

Our dog is fine and sleeping on a couch right now.

"Car got towed from both designated spot and visitor's spot at apartment complex, other tenants having same problem, 3 days still no response from property management.","I've been living in the same apartment complex (College Park, MD) with parents for the past almost five years. We always used the same parking passes, just like everyone else, but suddenly one morning my car gets towed from our designated spot. Towing company reasoning is ""Your passes are no longer valid. You need to speak with your property manager."" Neither my parents or I were ever informed about any new parking passes or anything. Met other tenants in the same building who also got their cars towed despite having a pass, and were never informed about new passes.

I try to get in contact with property management, call their company number and not even a receptionist answers. End up going down the extension list, trying to get a hold of anyone, still no answers. Property management's emergency line is the only one where somebody answers, and every time it's just an operator who says will pass on my message to a manager. The operator was at least helpful and said she's passing on my message to multiple managers. Still no call back, and every time I call back there never seems to be any manager available, regardless of time of day. I tell operator to mention in the message that I'm going to go pick up my car, because otherwise the fees will keep piling up, but I demand to be paid back for this. Emphasis on the fact that other tenants including me are getting towed despite never being informed about new parking passes.

Pick up my car in the morning, figure well if my pass is now no longer valid that means I can't park in my own designated spot, so I'll just park in a visitor's spot. Four hours later, my car gets towed again. Reason? ""You need a pass for visitor spots now, too."" At this point I'm absolutely livid, we suddenly can't park in our designated spots or visitor spots with out some new parking passes, and I'm now $450 down the drain. We were never informed about new passes, and we can't even get new passes because property management is being unresponsive.

What can the other tenants and I possibly do about this?

\*\*UPDATE\*\*: Wow I can't believe my most popular post on Reddit is me being pissed about my car getting towed lol Also for people asking, no I don't got to UMD, and no the apartment is not in anyway affiliated with the school. Alright so me and two other tenants (Just for clarification, my parents legally own our apartment, the two other tenants are renting their apartment from somebody) tried going to the address provided by the emergency line, turns out it's wrong and they haven't been in that address in years. Great start. We're finally able to get the new address, head there, and was able to get a hold of the property manager of our complex. He does give us all the new parking passes, which is good I guess. He claims that a (1) notice was sent out via mail back on March 28, and he handed all three of us a copy of them. Neither my parents or I ever received this notice in the mail, and the two other tenants' landlord claims he never received the notice either. He also claims, and is also stated in the notice, that on May 2nd he and a member of the board of directors were in the parking lot between 5:30-7:30pm handing out the new parking passes as a courtesy. Not going door to door, or even entering the actual apartment complex, just hanging around the parking lot. He also claims that he is not involved with or personally authorized the towing company. When asked who was responsible, he said the board of directors. When asked for the board of directors' contact information, he said that he can only give that information to the property owners (aka my parents and the two other tenants' landlord). The property manager was also overall pretty snarky and rude with us, kept deflecting the fact that I wasn't getting any responses from the 3 days worth of phone calls, saying that isn't his responsibility, and then telling the three of us ""You kids need to learn how to control your tempers.""

It's great that we got the new parking passes while we were there, but this is still absurd. At this point, what should be our best course of action? And could we still possibly take this court? The other two tenants did say they were gonna get in contact with their lawyer and would definitely keep in touch for this.",legaladvice

I left some volatile gummy bears on the desk now my co-worker wants to sue me,"This is in Michigan. I am originally from Germany and very unsure how the law works in the United States so bear with me. 

Last year I received a job offer to work as an assistant professor in the German language department at a large university in Michigan. I recently finished my PhD and was really excited to fill a research position (and possible post doc position) in the specific field I applied to. 




Most of my time I give classes in German literature but additionally the university would like me to help students with writer's block so I joined an interdisciplinary workshop. 

There are at least 4 people connected to this workshop and we get along fine most of the time. Sadly there is one elderly woman who made me out as a rival day one. 

I do not know what provoked her but there is something about me that makes her mad.  Cue the incident...I had an appointment with a student, gave him some tips and instructions and left my bowl with gummy bears on the desk. 

Mind you, these gummy bears a sugar free and volatile, if you eat more than a handful you are in serious fart troubles and you will occupy the toilet bowl for the rest of your day.

But my co-worker ate the whole bowl, first she excused herself from any commitments and then she called in sick. The next day she confronted me and blamed me for the whole ordeal, that I deliberately placed those gummy bears and it was all a ploy to humiliate her. 

According to her she has already informed HR and her lawyer and that I will be kicked out of the country in no time. The only thing I can blame myself on is that me and my colleagues giggled at her bowel distress signals.

Blind furry sexually harassing me at work. [FL],"I'm 18 and I work part time at a Starbucks in Florida (along with another serving job). I'm a girl and I just finished losing a considerable amount of weight, and I'm receiving attention for the first time in my life and I'm still not really used to dealing with it. I do know that the way I'm being treated now is very screwed up, but I'm not sure how to handle it.

There's a man who started coming in every day, who I've interacted every shift of mine for the last month. He is at least in his mid-twenties and comes in wearing a tail and making furry jokes very often. He is somehow visually impaired and he brings in his service animal to guide him, and he makes sexually charged and inappropriate jokes EVERY time I've interacted with him, regardless of whether I'm make his drink/taking orders/giving drinks. If I'm not at the counter he yells inappropriately. The worst example I can think is him ordering a ""puppachino"" that we offer and letting his dog start to lick it and then holding it back to me. ""For the two favorite b****es in my life"" with a giant smile on his face before licking the top himself. It's usually not nearly that bad but it's pretty similar. He has pulled up inappropriate drawings on his phone and asked if I like doggy style. That specific puppachino incident was two days ago and his behavior continues to get worse. He does not seem to be severely mentally ill with anything and I think he's very aware of how uncomfortable he makes me. 

My manager generally isn't someone who is easy to get along with, and when I approached him with this he essentially handwaved away my complaints and told me that he couldn't do anything and that dealing with this was part of the job. He also explained that he knew about this specific guy because one of my other coworkers already spoke to him on MY behalf without me asking (so I know it's not just me!) but he can't do much because the guy is disabled? I know that that's ridiculous, but I'm not sure where I go with it. It's not like I can really argue back. 

Can anyone help me out with what to do? I currently live alone and I need this job but this one guy has turned what is otherwise a really fun and nice place to work into a place that makes me sick. Thanks. ",legaladvice
"I am a teacher who is having a baby over the summer. I want to use my sick leave and then take an unpaid leave of absence, but HR is trying to tell me I can't use my sick leave. Please advise.

As it was explained to me, I need to take this as a ""leave of absence.""

And something about not being able to pay for both a temp and me on leave at the same time...

I don't see why they can't hire the temp, use them as the sub for the first two months, and then change their status to temp and pay them accordingly. They are essentially telling me I can't claim over $4000 by using my sick/personal leave, which I obviously need since this is unpaid leave for a year.

My gym membership was forged,"Earlier this year, I registered with ClassPass to hit the gym in New York City.  I went to a few gyms, including Crunch Fitness.

"[FL] Transmission shop destroyed my girlfriends center console, and is completely outing her life in google reviews","My girlfriend took her car to this transmission shop to get it fixed and they ended up spending like $4k on a brand new transmission to be put in. 

Two weeks later, the tranny started acting up again with the exact same issue so she took it back and when she came back to retrieve the car after it was repaired, she found her entire center console was destroyed. 

When she said something to the owner, he completely denied it and said they didn't do it, and it was completely destroyed and for sure wasn't like that before it was brought in. My girlfriend didn't want to get into a confrontation, so when he proceeded to call her a bitch for the accusations, she said fuck you and walked out and slammed the door.

The guy ended up chasing her out of the shop, screaming in her face which is when his wife came running out and got in between them. My girlfriend then got in the car, and left and called the cops. They sent an officer out there and he told her, if she wants the parts replaced, her best chance is to write a letter to the shop. Like WTF. 

We then left 1 star google reviews, and less than 24 hours later, six or seven 5 star reviews popped up with the most generic reviews of the shop, and then at the end of the reviews, they would completely blast me and my girlfriend calling us dumb college kids and saying we were lying about the entire situation, even though there is photos of the center console attached to my girlfriends review.

One guy even said he was there while it happened and watched it go down, when it was just my gf and the owner! 

The weirdest thing that triggered me to post this, was that today we noticed another review. It's written like one of her friends wrote it, and they completely dropped every piece of information of her life, saying shes crazy because of certain things, so don't trust her reviews and that it's a really good place. It was weirdly specific, stating places she used to live 4 years ago and stuff about her father and step father. 

We have lived in this city for like 4 months, and havent met anyone that would know any of that information which is leading me to believe they hired a PI or maybe have connections to the cops in this city to pull all of that information.

"[UPDATE] I haven't seen or heard from my biological father in 21 years, and I received a phone call saying that they need the next of kin to make decisions.","So I wanted to thank everyone who commented and replied on the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8azu76/i_havent_seen_or_heard_from_my_biological_father/?ref=share&ref_source=link) as it really helped me feel better about the decision to relinquish my rights as his power of attorney.

On Sunday, my aunt had called to let me know that when she visited him and asked if he wanted to see his children, and he tried to open his eyes and blinked several times so she insinuated that it was a yes. To be honest, I only agreed to go because I knew I had to do this for myself so that I wouldn't live with the possibility of regret that I did or did not see him in his dying days (even though I know I don't owe him anything). It was also an hour and a half drive from where I currently live in Louisiana.

So when I went to go see my dad, the doctor wanted to speak with me, my aunt and uncle first about what to do and who's going to have the power of attorney. I told them I wanted to withdraw my responsibility and then the doctor said that I can give it to someone else. I gave my aunt and uncle that option and they said they were in the same boat as I was and didn't know what to do either. If none of us decides to hold that responsibility, then the decision will ultimately go to the State and it'll be up to them with the next steps of care. I also asked if there would be a financial burden to whoever becomes his power of attorney. The doctor said she wasn't sure but she believes that he has Medicare/Medicaid, but anything not covered by them would be the responsibility of the power of attorney. 

So I finally go in to see him with my aunt and uncle and he just seems kind of unresponsive. He has very little brain function and is pretty much equivalent to a person who has gone through several strokes. My aunt was trying to wake him up to open his eyes, and he slightly fluttered his eyelids. They told me to talk to him. So I asked them if I could have some privacy because I really didn't know what to say. I just kind of stood there for a second after they left and just talked about myself. I felt like I was in an interview or something. I was just like ""hey dad..... it's liveliftlove"" and he turned his heads towards me and opened his eyes a little bigger, but I'm not sure what brain functions are still working (doctor didn't have MRI on hand so we weren't sure what brain functions weren't hypoxic) and I just started talking about myself. I told him I'm turning 27 year this, I've gone to college, have 2 degrees, don't have any kids, have a side business, and am currently living in Louisiana. Then, I said something along the lines of  ""I know it's been 21 years since you've seen or heard from me..."" and then I started choking up because I knew what I wanted to say next but I had a difficult time saying it. A part of me just wanted to get super angry and say ""I turned out okay without you or maybe because you left I became who I am. You had nothing to do with raising me and the successes I have achieved to this day"". Ultimately I said I forgave him and that I hope he finds peace and happiness in the next lifetime or whatever it is that he believes him. I saw tears come out of his eyes, so I'm not sure if he heard me and was reacting or if it was just because he had all of these tubes in and out of him and he was having some sort of gag reflex. It was just kind of hard to recognize him because the majority of his face had something covering it with the ventilating and feeding tubes. I still felt like I was talking to a stranger, but I just hope he knew I was there and that it made him feel better. I don't feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulder or like a sigh of relief. I'm actually pretty okay with whatever happened, and I know I won't have any regrets with that part of my life. 

Apparently, he has a group of friends that was also there and they all looked at me and was like ""omg, she looks just like the mom."" I got annoyed after we visited, and we all sat together in the waiting room talking and trying to find out more information and they just kept telling me I'm his child, I need to do this, this, and that and to force my brother to come see him. I just didn't say anything because I didn't want to be disrespectful. In my head I really just wanted to scream ""FUCK YOU and FUCK YOUR OPINIONS, because you guys got to know him more than I ever had and it's not anyone's fault but HIS that he chose not to be a part of my life so don't you DARE tell me what I should and should not do."" But we found out that they got in touch with the wife in Vietnam and she's trying to come over here to visit and she has been given the power of attorney, so he's currently on full code until they can get her a visa/sponsorship over here (which he'll probably pass before that can even happen). 

Thanks everyone for reading. I know this update is a little long, but I thought it might've been courteous to those who have taken their time to offer their advice.

My father recently passed and now my family is trying to say that i am not his child and that i should not have the rights to make decisions as next of kin.,"I live in Oregon. I am the only child of my father. When my dad passed away I got all of the mortuary stuff set up and paid for services. I also decided to let my father be an organ donor (he never disclose whether he was for or against this decision). About ten minutes after I learned of his death, I began to call all of the family members so that they heard about it from me instead of a third party. After the phone calls I spent most of the next few days making sure his girlfriend (they spent 13 years together so I feel like they were practically married) was ok and we'll taken care of. I learned that while I was taking care of her, my family went to the mortuary and claimed that I am not his biological son and that I should have no rights in making decisions about my dad. The mortuary called me to confirm that I am indeed his son. I offered to bring them a copy of my birth certificate that has his name listed as the father as proof of lineage. The mortuary requests that I do not pick up my father's ashes for the next few days while he waits for them to file legal paperwork.


My questions are:

 what paperwork would they even be able to file?

 Should I be doing anything else to make sure that I am not legally in the wrong (such as brining in my birth certificate as proof) ?

"[CA/TX] My brother, who I have not seen in 8 years, and who is a minor showed up at my doorstep.","Hello everyone, 
I am a 26[F].  About 8 years ago, when I turned 18, I ran away from my home in rural Texas.  My parents are extremely conservative Christians.  While they were not physically abusive, they did not allow me to go to any college because ""education is not for woman.""  My BF, now husband, sent me money in cash and I got a PO box and ran away.  I have not seen, heard, or talked to them ever since.  Before I left, I told my brother, who was 8 at the time, my BF's landline number and a code word to identify himself (in retrospect I was 18 and immature and I felt cool running away).  I told my brother to use the landline only in the most extreme circumstances.

Yesterday morning my brother, now 16 showed up at my doorstep.  To say I was shocked would be an understatement.  He paid someone to look up my address on a website when he was in Texas.  The way he ran away is similar to mine.  His ""friend"" (I suspect it is his friend, but he appears to have a crush on him) sent him cash money he then used to buy an airplane ticket.

The reason he gave for running away was that he was gay.  My parents frequently are homophobic.  They also say that gay people should be going to conversion camps.   Although he won't admit it, I suspect my brother may have depression.  At this point I don't know what to do legally.  I suspect that my parents may have filed a missing complaint, but I am not sure.  I haven't received any calls from the police or any visits from them.  So here are some questions.

1) Am I under any legal obligation to contact my parents letting them know where he is?  Is it illegal to not do so?  I have no desire to talk to them.

2) Am I under any legal obligation to tell the police where he is?  Is it illegal to not contact them?

3) I know the chance is almost close to zero of my getting any sort of guardianship of him, but does planning to send a child to a conversion camp that has led to the suicides of my brother's two friends constitute child abuse?  Does it constitute child abuse in California?  Does it constitute child abuse in Texas?  

4) In the most negative scenario, under which my brother is forced to return to Texas and then forced to go to a conversion camp, what can he do to protect himself physically and mentally?

5) Does telling a child constantly that he will go to hell because he is a ""sodomite"" and he is a ""pedophile"" constitute emotional abuse such that CPS could reasonably place him in another home?  Does talking about conversion camp constitute emotional abuse?

Edit: Side note, the friend who sent him the money is someone I know.  I know him because I use to tutor him in the homework program at the local library.",legaladvice
Update! [California] Neighbour constantly blocking my wheelchair access ramp,"[Here's the link to my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6dj4qh/california_neighbour_constantly_blocking_my/?st=j8u5lhg8&sh=e0c0b34e)

Hello!

The person who directed me to this legal help forum mentioned that it's customary to give updates once significant progress is made in a case. So, since I'm currently sitting in a car, still a couple hundred miles away from home, this is as good a time as any to tell you guys what's been going on. :)

Following your advice I contacted the authorities to have the area around the ramp marked out as a no-parking spot. They weren't able to help me since the street is owned by my neighbourhood's homeowner association. Now, my house is one of the few in the area that is not part of that organisation, but I decided to contact them anyway. The president turned out to be a wonderful lady who was of immense help to me. She helped resolve the parking situation by designating the area around the ramp as a no-parking spot. I felt bad about inconveniencing my neighbours, but the homeowner association agreed to my idea of extending the street parking zone by a few yards on the other side of my neighbours' house, that way they still have somewhere to park their fifth car. She did all that as a gesture of goodwill without me being a member of their organisation, which made me fall in love with the neighbourhood even more. Also, I'm really glad I didn't have to involve the police.

Since my accessibility issue has been resolved I've decided to pull the trigger and buy the house I live in. I'm currently in the process of finalising the purchase which is taking slightly longer than usual due to a complex ownership situation, still at this point my estate agent is assuring me that there should be no more roadblocks, which makes me really happy. Once I'm the owner of the house I'm planning to join the homeowner association as well. I've also been asked to become their accessibility consultant to help make sure all of their future projects are wheelchair friendly, which is a huge honour to me and makes me confident that this is the right place for me. :)

On top of all that, I've reached an agreement with the homeowner association and two other couples to build a second ramp a little further down the street and split the cost between all of us. Every party, including the homeowner association will be covering a quarter of the price and we have a promise that this time a no-parking spot will be marked out immediatelly. :) The project is set to begin once the purchase of my house is finalised.

Thanks once again for all your help! What started out as a nuisance has become a fantastic adventure that reassured me that I've found a place I can truly call home!",legaladvice
My great aunt believed the scam where the IRS calls and demands payment in iTunes cards. The cashier was suspicious of an elderly woman purchasing so many and called the police. The cashier was fired the next day for costing her workplace a purchase.,"My location is Florida. Apologies if this is an obvious question, I am not familiar with the law in any way and have no idea about the legality of this.

My 70 year old great aunt got a call from the ""IRS"" saying she owed them money or she would be arrested. They said she had to pay them in gift cards ASAP. Of course this is a well known scam but my great aunt believed it (we've since told her about how these scams work and she knows now to call one of her kids if she gets a call asking for money or personal information). My great aunt went out and tried to purchase hundreds of dollars in iTunes gift cards. The cashier got suspicious of an elderly woman buying so many for so much, especially after my great aunt couldn't tell her what iTunes was. The cashier knew what was going on and called the police and got my great aunt to call a family member. My great aunt did not buy any gift cards or lose any money.

The next day my cousin went to thank the cashier but she was not in and the manager told my cousin she had quit. Another employee approached my cousin in the parking lot and said the cashier was actually fired. My cousin left his number with the employee and the cashier later called him. She was terminated the day after she helped my great aunt. The reasons in her termination letter (which I have seen) were ""acting outside her authority as an employee"" and ""actions causing /company's name/ to lose a transaction or purchase"" due to an incident on /date she helped my aunt/. Her manager verbally told her it was for ""stopping that old lady from spending $700""

My family is angry on her behalf. She's only in her early 20s and is working full time to help her family while going to college part time at night. She was denied unemployment because she was fired for cause. My family would help her but we are not well off by any stretch. Was it even legal for her company to fire her for helping save a person from being scammed? Does she have any means to contest this? 

Thank you for your time.",legaladvice
Got terminated after telling boss I'm pregnant,"I've been working at this company for a year and a half and have had no negative feedback or commentary about my work. I had about 3 major projects and 2 smaller projects going on as of November 2018. Around December, stating there's not enough work for everyone, my boss took one of my major projects and one of my smaller projects and gave them to other team members in similar positions as me. I was OK with this, as I figured if others don't have workload it is OK to distribute it evenly. As of yesterday, I still had one major project closing out (deficiency work in progress), one major project active until at least June, and one smaller project until at least March. I was busy.

&#x200B;

In the middle of January, I found out I was pregnant. I've been dealing with strong bouts of morning sickness and decided to tell my boss on Feb 8th that I am pregnant via a formal letter and email - after my first ultrasound & prenatal confirmation (Feb 6th and 7th respectively - I was about 8 weeks).

After having very little communication with me during this period, he decided to terminate my employment yesterday, 12 days after finding out I'm pregnant. The reason he stated is that ""there is not enough work"" and business ""economical decisions"". However, none of the other team members in similar positions have been given reduced work, hours, or terminations. I am the only one affected.

I was also not offered any other opportunity for reduced work hours, work loads, or even an opportunity for early mat leave which I would've definitely considered if it meant maintaining somewhat steady employment during this time.

&#x200B;

I am currently taking anti-nausea medication (that I have to remain on for the duration of pregnancy) and pregnancy-triggered asthma medication along with having some gum/teeth bleeding issues that are also symptoms from pregnancy. I had booked a dental appointment on March 9th for this issue. After this termination I've lost my health insurance (husband is self-employed and was on my insurance). I've been only given one week of insurance coverage which does not even cover the end of the month.

&#x200B;

I am wondering what my legal rights are in this situation.

&#x200B;

P.S. I haven't taken any time away from work due to my symptoms. We have the opportunity to work remotely from site or home if need be and I have followed through every single day, even if I was bedridden, with all of my work emails and tasks for the day. I have informed my manager of every appointment (there were only 3) and taken time off either during lunch breaks or scheduled it accordingly to not affect my work schedule. Tuesday this week was my first sick day since December 2017, when I took two sick days.

EDIT: Location Calgary, Alberta, Canada and the company is a medium sized construction company with approximately 80 people.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just wanted to add on a bit more info on the ""transfer of job"" situation that occurred that one commenter had asked whether it was a common practice?  
And the answer is pretty frequently actually, this is why I didn't think anything of it. My major project that is closing out/deficiency phase began before I started employment and was under a coworker with the same role as me and was passed on to me. Same coworker had another job which started last year, they were on it for 2 months early last year, then it was passed on to me for the rest of it. One of my initial smaller jobs I did with this company had 3 parts, I did finishing of part 1 and entirety of part 2, and part 3 was passed on to another coworker. This was done all the time based often on location of the sites (who can conveniently drive there) or person's availability or who knows what else. 

It never occurred to us anything that would spell ""role reduction"" and my former coworker confirmed this also as we had this discussion before.",legaladvice
[UPDATE] If a traffic sign hits your car can you sue the city?,"Thank you for the great advice offered when I posted to /r/legaladvice . I took that advice and was successful.

I have an update: Warning this is going to be very long. A year+ of bullshit denials. Skip to the end for the TLDR.

* Accident tore a hole through the roof and nicked the winshied. Repairs were about $1000.  Insurance deductible was $1000. I caught the incident on a dashcam that records speed, gps time, gps position.
* Contacted IDOT with their form. IDOT referred me to ISTHA.
* ISTHA identified the location as under the control of company (we'll call them) ""JCo""
* JCo sends a letter saying that it wasn't in their area and it was in company ""KCo's"" area.
* I call KCo - they say ""Nope""
* I get a call back from the local director of ""JCo"" ( let's call him ""POS"" ) says it wasn't them and that someone else also had property damage that that KCo is handling the issues and KCo is the company to contact, not them.
* I send a letter to ISTHA and include a map that identifies time and GPS lat/lon location along with the note about the phone call.
* ISTHA send a letter back to Jco which states ""NO - it's JCo's area and handle this with the injured party directly and CC risk management with the details""
* 6 months go by - nothing. I follow up with a letter and a screenshot of the dashcam video with a mile-marker visible. Asking for a response.
* Jco says ""Winds were 41 mph that day - not our responsibility""
* I follow back with [this letter](https://imgur.com/a/Pm3xyBb) showing that the raw data from NWS (stored by NOAA) says their claim is without merit.

No response. So now I'm getting worried about the statute of limitations as we're getting close to 1 year away from the event.

I called ISTHA and say what's up. They ""can't offer advice."" I forget exactly how I asked but it came up that engineering might want to be CC'd on my next letter as they decide who gets bids.

I start looking around for lawyers. It turns out that I have to file in Illinois.  There are some great resources for lawyers in Illinois, but when the lawyers hear it's for $1000 in damages, they all say ""no "" - that in good conscience they can't take a case that will cost much more in their time costs than I'd get back in damages. Fine. I'll do it myself.

So I look at the Illinois Small claims court. It allows electronic filing. I know you can lose with incorrect details on the filing, but the state of IL provides numbers you can call for people representing themselves in small claims court. I call. I find out:

* You have to file in the district court in which the accident occurred.
* You can ask for court fees when you file.
* Don't put anything much on the complaint other than ""the accident occurred at X location at Y time, this is in this district in which I'm filing, defendant refuses to pay, therefore I'm filing for damages + court fees + related fees. ""
* The classification you have to put down when filing.
* You can file online and the date of submission is the date when you press ""submit"" (if before 4 pm? I forget the exact time)

I call Jco and the conversation with POS goes like this:

Me: I want to avoid a lawsuit but I need you to pay for damages and the statute of limitations is coming up.

POS: Four other people had this issue - one was a woman who said a tractor trailer hit the sign.

Me: What is her name?

POS: Don't know but she said she sued the trucking company for $4000.

Me: What's the name of the trucking company?

POS: Don't know but you should be suing them, not us.

Me: How did a truck hit the sign - the sign was behind a concrete barrier?

POS: Yeah the truck hit the barrier, bounced off it and damaged the barrier and sign.

Me: The dashcam video shows no such evidence. The barriers are all fine and there aren't even skid marks up them. I might have to take you to court.

POS: See you in court! Wasn't even our sign - the sign is from a subcontractor (names subcontractor).

Me: What's their number?

POS: (gives the number)

So I call the sign subcontractor. Dead end. I file the lawsuit against Jco, ask for damages + costs to file the lawsuit.  Choose just regular certified mail.

* a month or two later and I get a letter from their corporate office (this supposedly local company was actually a subdivision of a much larger company - possibly international) asking to settle and not bring any future claims about this matter in exchange for 100% of what I asked for. I agree.
* Call the small claims court and ask about cancelling the lawsuit and the legal advocate there insists ""UNTIL THE CHECK CLEARS DO NOT CANCEL THE LAWSUIT"". Ok - I get it, but what's the process? ""UNTIL THE CHECK CLEARS DO NOT CANCEL THE LAWSUIT - people get caught by this all the time!!!"" - Uh, ok - I really do understand, but what is the process? Can't do it - have to go to trial, but you can tell the judge at that time that you ask for dismissal.
* Check clears a few days before the trial.
* Call the court and they say that I have to show up but if nobody shows up, the case is dismissed and that this is vey common. I say it would be a long drive and inconvenient for me to get there and I ask if I can just fax in my request to dismiss the case with settlement details. They say yes make it attn: the person I'm  talking to and the judge. I send the fax.
* I call Jco to let POS know I'm asking the case to be dismissed ... he's no longer with the company.

TLDR; Road contracting company is negligent and causes damage to people's vehicles, asshole director gives me the run around, says ""Sue me"". I do. They pay. He's gone (fired?).

&#x200B;

P.S. Having public resources like GPS ,the court system, NOAA, is AWESOME. I couldn't have stood up to a massive company like this without either spending a shitload on lawyer fees or having taxpayer-paid infrastructure like judicial advocates, freely accessible NOAA data, and a legal system that puts individual claimants on an equal basis with any dishonest company.  People may complain about paying taxes but a well run government is an indispensable tool for us regular citizens.

P.P.S. Always have a dashcam that records GPS datetime and location. An $80 investment saved me $1000. The one I have isn't sold anymore and isn't as good as newer ones, so am not identifying it.",legaladvice

[CA] I smashed a drone in my yard this morning. What can happen to me?,"Obligatory on mobile, etc. 

This morning, as per usual, I got up at 5, got ready, and left at around 5:15. Ten minutes later, my wife calls me saying there's a drone hovering in our backyard and it's making her feel unsafe and violated, as if she's being watched. We have two dogs, but otherwise she was home alone early in the morning and scared. 

I drove back home and found it hovering about a foot off the ground in the middle of my yard, with a camera attached and I assume on. I walked outside with a baseball bat and tried to gesture to the camera for it to leave, and even brandished the bat a couple of times. After it still hasn't moved, I hit it with the bat, which broke the blades off a couple of motors and knocked the battery off. 

I brought it inside and left for work, and my wife was very grateful and felt much better after I left. 

I personally felt that the only reason someone would be flying a drone that close to the ground at that time of morning was to either harass my dogs, or to scope out my home for burglary, so I felt I made a safe and conscious decision to protect my family and pups. 

But now I'm curious about the liability and my research tells me there's a lot of debate about whether it's legal for someone to be on your property that low with a UAV or whether I legally had the right to destroy it. 

Can I be held liable for the damage? If the owners come to my door can I just give them the drone back and tell them to keep it off my property, or will be be expected to pay for the cost of a replacement? Do I have any defense for protecting my home and dogs from invasive cameras and a nuisance danger for my dogs? 

In southern California, by the way.

Edit: thank you guys so much for the reassurances, I promise I have read every comment. obviously, given that it was very early in the morning and I was already running late for work, coupled with the fact that my wife was deeply uncomfortable and felt unsafe, I reacted more emotionally than I probably should have. 

Now that I know it was likely an accidental situation caused by a lost connection, when I get home I'm probably going to look into the device and see if I can determine its make, model, and potentially who owns it. I feel pretty guilty that I destroyed what was likely a fairly expensive piece of equipment, but I do stand by my decision to act in favor of my family's safety. I'm debating reaching out to the owner if I can find them to return the broken pieces but haven't decided if it's worth the risk of being sued especially considering the vague laws regarding shooting down an aircraft. Thank you for all of your advice and I hope either way the pilot takes more care in ensuring their equipment stays in their line of sight and off private property.",legaladvice
"Agreed to front money for a trip that had to be cancelled, now friends are refusing to pay the non-refundable costs (New York)","Let me preface this by saying that I'm not sure if my grievance has any legal standing, but I have evidence of it in the form of texts and Facebook messages.

Last year, three friends and I attempted to plan a week-long vacation abroad to Iceland, where they had been before but I had not. 

Two of them were fresh out of grad school and I was currently earning the biggest wage out of the four, so I agreed to book the flights and Airbnb house on the promise of reimbursement for their shares. This was to have taken place in the fall of 2018.

Prior to the trip taking place, one of them informed me that she had changed jobs in the interim and had not accrued enough leave time to make the trip. Another told me that his boss had demanded that he chair a meeting that coincided with the trip, and threatened his promotion if he took the leave time. The third would not agree to come if their boyfriend (the second one) wasn't coming. 

So one by one they dropped out, after I had already spent some $2,800 in bookings. In spite of this, they assured me that they'd still recompense me the loss, since I was forced to cancel the whole thing, not wanting to travel solo to a place I had no experience in. 

Airbnb fortunately refunded me most of the money, but the airline would only offer me non-transferrable credit with hefty rebooking fees and a strict time limit, which rendered the credit more or less useless. I wound up visiting the UK in February and plan to visit again this summer, but the airline that holds the credit doesn't offer a viable UK itinerary that I can use.

So it's been roughly seven months since the trip was due to take place, and I'm still owed roughly $1,200. The two who owe the bulk of it are increasingly avoiding me, in spite of their repeated promises to pay me back. I understand that their bosses were inflexible, if that's indeed what happened, but the deal was always that they would pay me back, trip or no trip.

I'm wondering if I have any legal avenues to pursue recompense if they continue to kick the can over this, and whether or not text and Facebook messages are admissible evidence in this situation.",legaladvice
"I got visited by some agency, and I don't know what to do","Hi! I'm a lurker on Reddit most of the time, and I didn't plan on getting an account until this absolutely surreal experience a couple of days ago. I live in an apartment building near Atlanta if that helps. 

I was visited by this government agency I've never heard of called TSA, it's not the airport one since I've haven't travelled via plane for years now, and because I don't think TSA officers can visit peoples homes. They said they were law enforcement, and that they needed to search my apartment but I didn't let them in because I've never heard of an agency called the TSA other than the airport one.

They showed me a warrant, but I still didn't let them in. Eventually, they called for someone, and someone from the FBI came from their office in Atlanta, they showed their card and they were from something called GEMA-HS, I don't know what that stands for. They got in contact with the police which confirmed the warrant, and I allowed them to enter my apartment.

They did a search then left. Am I in trouble because I haven't done anything wrong, I'm a grad student and I can't afford for something to go on my record.

I'm still pretty confused as their uniforms had an emblem on it with 3 mountains and the uniforms they were wearing did not resemble law enforcement uniforms but rather they were wearing very professional suits and I didn't see any weapons on them.

EDIT: I contacted the Atlanta Bar Association's attorney referral line as directed to by u/triceratops. They put me in contact with an attorney whom I've spoken to, and he's told me to not speak about the case anymore. We've set up an initial consultation meeting, and I would like to thank everyone who helped me sort this out. I was totally lost in the beginning and had no idea what to do, but you guys gave me guidance and helped me out during my time of need and for that I am very grateful! 

About the CO leak, I called the fire department and they said they're already at my apartment assessing the leak. The utility company has also been called, and they're sending their own representatives as well. My friend took me to the hospital to get assessed for CO poisoning, and I'm currently here and they're preforming some tests on me.

Restaurant owners took 24% of my tip last night.,"UPDATE: I'm actually working a shift at this place right now. My plan was to talk with the owners in person after the shift, however a handful of you have suggested emailing/texting would be better since there's no guarantee they'd consent to being recorded. My plan now is to email them either after my shift tonight or some time tomorrow after I've made some necessary calls. I understand now that it may be legal after all given that it was an included service charge. Some have speculated that they may be paying employer-based taxes with it, however for the past five years I've been here they haven't been going anywhere near our gratuities. Hopefully they'll be honest with me when I email them and I can let you guys know what's really going on. Again, thank you all for the advice. I'm trying my best to reply to all of the comments. I wasn't expecting this much attention.

———————

I live in Maryland. I wait tables for $3.63 an hour plus tips. Last night I was handed an invoice for a party I was working and at the very bottom, written in pen, the owner's wife/co-owner wrote ""tip x 0.78 = tip for server"". That's 22% of my gratuity. On top of that they've been taking 2% of our gratuity every night to help pay for the credit/debit card transactions. The fact that the owners are taking our tip money because they need spending money infuriates me. Especially considering we already share 25% with the support service staff.

Edit: Thanks all for the advice. My plan now is to confront one of the owners about it and make sure to record what's said. Updates to come later.

EDIT 2: To all those concerned, I actually started work at another job 3 months ago in anticipation of this restaurant going out of business, or me having to quit. Haven't pulled the trigger yet because even with both jobs money is tight. Being trained to bartend at the new place and from the looks of it, once I'm done with my training, the money from that will sustain me enough so that I can quit the restaurant in question. I appreciate the concern, you all have been incredibly helpful.",legaladvice
School has suspended my 3rd grader for saying the word 'gun'. - NY,"Yesterday I got a call from my 8 year old son's school, saying i had to immediately pick him up, but they did not say why. I rushed out of work to get him, and when I got to the school the vice principal had him in the office. I was told that my son was being suspended for a week, and would be mandated to see a social worker twice a week. When I asked what was going on, I was told that my son made threatening statements to another student during indoor recess, and it was overheard by the recess monitor and reported. My son was looking really upset at all this, but the vice principal said it was the rules and there was nothing that could be done. I then turned to my son and asked him what he said, and he told me he was flexing his arm muscles in the gym and said 'Look at these guns!'.   


 Apparently 'gun' is a trigger word that all staff have to report, no matter what the context, and an investigation has to occur before the student is allowed to return. The vice principal reiterated that it could be construed as a threatening statement and that school policy was that he would need to see a social worker twice a week during his recess period.

I am beyond pissed off at this. What exactly can I do? I now will have to take time off of work for three days next week, and  probably the full week after since they told me they won't be able to do the investigation thanksgiving week. ",legaladvice
"(New York) Girlfriend is pregnant. I want the baby, she wants to give up for adoption. What does the law say? (Update)","I guess it's time for me to post an update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5pbvb7/new_york_girlfriend_is_pregnant_i_want_the_baby/) post. I don't have a happy update however. So much has happened.

On the advice of this sub I went to a lawyer and did all the necessary paperwork. My girlfriend changed her mind a few times between wanting to raise the baby with me and wanting adoption but in the final weeks of the pregnancy she told me that I'm not the father at all. I thought she was lying so I asked to do a test. We went and did one of the prebirth blood tests and the result was negative. She was telling the truth. I wasn't the father.

I broke up with her her then. I was so heartbroken. She had cheated on me and made me think I was going to be a father for months. I was curious about who the father was though. I asked her and she told me that it's the man who is going to adopt the child from her! Yes. This man fucked my girlfriend and now wants to adopt his own baby from my girlfriend with his wife who had no idea.

I thought his wife deserves to know so I went to their house (when he wasn't home) and told his wife everything. She had a complete breakdown in front of me. I felt sad that I caused this but I imagine it was her husband who cheated on her that really caused it. She called my now ex girlfriend to get confirmation and she told her the truth then called her husband and that was when I left.

Now the baby is born and I've heard that my ex girlfriend and the man have moved in together in an apartment and are raising the baby! I guess his wife will divorce him soon.

It will take me years to recover from this. I thank you for your advice and help. It's sad that things turned out this way and I hope this baby grows up to be a decent person despite being raised by two cheaters. ",legaladvice
"20+ years later, still paying for the mistakes of my youth","I'm trying to figure out if there's anything I can do here short of applying for a pardon and hoping for the best.

I live in Michigan, USA.  In 1996-97 when I was 18-19 years old, I was charged with a pair of felonies and a misdemeanor, all in separate incidents because I was young, stupid, and made poor decisions.  Destruction of property, theft of items from a motor vehicle over $5.00, and retail fraud (forgot to pay for gas at the gas station).  The latter of the offenses was a legitimate mistake on my part but that really doesn't matter.  The court cases for all three went pretty much the same way.  Court appointed attorney recommended a guilty plea and he would petition for the minimum sentence.  Stupid decisions on my part all around, but he did what he said and I served no jail time, received no probation, no community service.  I paid restitution and court costs totaling less than $1000, much of which was restitution for the window that I broke.

None of these details matter much in the grand scheme of things.  The fact is that, because I have TWO felonies on my record, getting either of them expunged is out of the question.  I feel like I've more than paid my debt to society for these mistakes but I am constantly reminded that I will continue paying for these mistakes.

I work in IT Security as a consultant and while my employer is aware of my past, we will occasionally have clients request or perform their own background checks.  This creates a problem for me at work as I am unable to work with certain clients (law enforcement, government, gaming, etc.) and I can't help but feel at some point, my employer will become tired of dealing with this restriction.

I'm unable to officially be involved in anything school related with my two children.  What I mean by this is that coaching, chaperoning, or any other involvement is prohibited because of my felonies.  I was informed of this years ago when I simply picked my oldest son up from school and filled out paperwork to be able to do so, including fingerprints.  I received a letter a couple of weeks later stating that, while I was not restricted from picking my son up from school, dropping him off, or entering the school, I was not allowed to accompany him on class field trips, coach any sports, or be otherwise involved in any school functions as a volunteer due to my criminal history.  Trying to explain to a 6 year old why his father can't coach his baseball team when he knows that I played baseball in college or that I can't go on his field trip to the zoo with him and watching his heart break each and every time kills me.  Both of my boys are old enough that I've now explained things to them, but that doesn't repair the damage I feel like I caused during their childhood by not being able to do those things.

These are just a few of the many ways this impacts my life on what seems like a daily basis.  I guess this post really has two purposes.  1) To see if there's anything else I can do short of applying for a pardon and 2) to serve as a cautionary tale.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Some of them, no matter how insignificant they may seem at the time, will stick with you for the rest of your life.

Edit:  Thank you all for the wonderful comments and suggestions.  I have reached out to an attorney and will be working with them to try and clear this up.

Out of the well over 100 comments and messages I've received in response to this, exactly two have been negative responses.  Everything else has been extremely positive and I thank each and every one of you for it.

I'll continue to post updates as I can but I'm sure this will be a long slow road.  I feel like the wheels are at least moving now and I'm not stuck in quicksand or mud.  Thank you again.",legaladvice

MY COUNTY I RESIDE IN CANNOT HELP ME BECAUSE OF CONFLICT BETWEEN LOCAL GOVTS. THERE IS ALSO A SEVERE LACK OF VIC. ADVO. IN MY AREA, MANY OF THEM ARE ASSIGNED UP TO 200 CASES YEARLY. RAINN HAS RECOMMENDED ME TO A LAWYER DEALING WITH POLICE NEGLIGENCE & MALPRACTICE, WHICH IS WHAT I INITIALLY NEEDED ADVICE REGARDING. I BELIEVE THERE WAS SEVERE NEGLIGENCE REGARDING MY CASE & HOW IT WAS HANDLED. THERE ARE MANY MANY DETAILS & FACTORS TO MY CASE NOT MENTIONED IN THIS POST THAT MAKE IT HARD FOR YALL TO UNDERSTAND WHY IM STRUGGLING WITH THE STEPS I NEED TO TAKE. IT CHALKS DOWN TO ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL TOO, PLEASE REMEMBER I WAS 18 & HOMELESS WHEN THIS HAPPENED. IM NOW 20 & COMPLETELY STABLE..

STAY STRONG OUT THERE. 

late august of 2017, it is to my belief, that i was drugged, raped & nearly strangled to death by two people i worked with. 

upon escaping the apartment i was in, i had to find someone in the complex to call 911 for me. the two people in question fled the scene, & the local pd took 20 minutes to arrive.* 

    *i awoke completely nude, groggy. i quickly found my clothes & got dressed. i heard the shower running, & i noticed white powder around the cup of hot choc. i had been drinking. i light a cigarette & grab my phone. the female in question comes out of the bedroom, & asks what i'm doing. i tell her i'm leaving, that i don't care what happened & that i just want to leave & go home. she makes a slick move for my car keys & i'm like ?? i'm just trying to leave dude. i turned around to grab my phone purse & she jumped onto my back & began strangling me. she puts me on the ground & i go in & out of consciousness. i literally thought i was going to die, i'm crying ""why me, why me"" saying my hail marys... i catch a moment to breathe & my fight/flight kicks in. i take my cig & burn her arm & face.. she released & i turned over & grabbed my purse.. pulled out pepper spray & sprayed her. i kicked her & took off running with my purse out her apartment door. i'm screaming, ""HELP CALL 911!"" ... it took me forever to get someone to come out & call 911. i was bare foot, in a flannel w no bra & panties w some cloth shorts...


i was transported to a local hospital where i waited an hour & a half for a SANE nurse. i was told she was on her way(aprox. 45 mins-90 mins) but i had a panic attack/existential crisis & requested i be taken back to my car. *

  * the two people took off in the mans car. they locked the apartment & therefore the police had to wait for a search warrant before entering the apartment to retrieve my phone & keys. after getting the warrant, they go in & my phone is gone but my keys are there. theres dildos, collars, drugs, blood & a bunch of other weird ass shit i dont wanna talk about. they inform the officer thats with me & thats when i decided to leave bc i needed to get ahold of my friends mom or someone. i was completely alone & estranged from my family.. i was 18 years old at this time.

once i get my keys & a way to contact my friends family, i go back to the hospital & wait 14 hours to do a rape kit. i completed but once the SANE nurse left, i left. i didnt fully check out because it had been nearly 24 hours & i wanted to go back to my friends & shower & fucking sleep. 

the days following, i have no contact with my detective. a full statement is never taken from me, & the two people are still MIA. i end having to quit my job bc coworkers hear about what has happened. they think im lying, even thothe two people in question are shady with criminal records. i phone my detective 5 days later asking for an update, to which he responds hes, ""been very busy withchild abuse & domestic violence cases."" & he would, ""do his best to try & prioritize my case"" i mentally shut down after this... i was 900$ in the hole with my phone being stolen & had 200$ to my name after having to leave my job. 

for months i hear nothing, i leave voicemails with the pd & det. & i get no response.. email inquires never go far & it was hard to get anything going. when i went to file restraining orders they didnt go thru because the charges had been dropped. the male cleared his name & claimed i was on a consensual, rape fantasy esque lesbian escapade. that he tried to pull the female off me & we got in a ""cat fight"" because, ""you know how crazy lesbians are."" (i am not a lesbian, & had a boyfriend at the time) i was under the impression the female was suppose to be my friend, not a romantic interest. 
the whole case is apparently dropped, i'm considered a washed up, lesbian drug addict & the dna is whatever.

today, october 1st of 2018, i received a voicemail from a det. at the pd claiming there was a hit on the male dna found near my peri anal, neck, & thighs.. & that they want to purse the case further....

what the fuck do is going on, what the fuck do i do

"[Update] Seattle, WA- Mentally Disabled Neighbor has twice followed us to our front door and attempted to enter. What are our options?","[Original Post](https://redd.it/8san7h).

Thank you all so much for your help and suggestions. First, a few things to clear up:

-We are NOT trigger-happy people looking to kill our neighbors (contrary to what a few comments and nasty PMs said). My husband has a handgun because he enjoys going shooting, and for protection. I am not thrilled, but as long as he is safe about it, it's not worth fighting over.

-We did not know the man was mentally disabled until AFTER the first incident. I feel our fear was justified given that a strange man followed us and our toddler home and then tried to open our door and window.

-I actually have quite a bit of compassion for the elderly and the disabled. I went to the house to speak with the caretaker to figure out how we could all keep this from happening again. I understand his hesitancy to give me any info, but I was trying to help the man rather than get the caretaker fired or have his license taken.

Onto the update:

After posting here, I followed the top suggestion to contact Adult Protective Services and filed a report. After filing the report, APS also referred me to the Complaint Resolution Unit, which deals directly with caretakers and aides under investigation. Because this had happened twice in three days, APS moved fast to visit the home and get in contact with the agency running the group home (note: they kept calling it a group home, but as far as I can tell, the man who followed us is the only resident there). The agency was very apologetic and horrified that these escapes had led to police contact twice. I was told alarms have been installed on all exterior doors so staff is alerted when he tries to escape. They will be bringing in additional staff as well, to ensure that this man has 2 aides assigned to him at all times.

The APS investigator let me know that the man is non-verbal and only understands very simple instructions, so simply asking him to leave our property wouldn't work. She mentioned that he hates being alone and probably latched onto our family because we looked safe. Apparently he also loves dogs and she thinks that's what caused him to come over the second time (we were in the front yard with our dog). Moving forward, I will be trying to arrange a meeting with the agency to come up with a plan in case this happens again. I'd rather not involve the police if I don't have to, so hopefully they will give me a number to call if he appears at our house again. Ultimately I'm very glad that this man will be getting the care he deserves and needs.",legaladvice
"My husband's ex-wife took my stepson to the dermatologist and told them to send the bill to us (without, of course, mentioning it to us). Shockingly, they did and are now hounding us to pay for services we never authorized or even knew about until after the fact. In Montana.","As the title describes, my stepson's mother took him to the dermatologist. The treatment he underwent was not medically necessary, but I'm glad he had the appointment regardless. That's not the point. 

The issue is that several months after the fact, my husband and I recieved a letter stating we were past due and owed the office several hundred dollars for the kiddo. This was doubly confusing, as my husband has used this doctor himself and they're a pay at time of service operation. I called and the office manager said the ex had said to just bill it to my husband. I advised her that, obviously, the ex wife is not able to speak for us financially, so what the heck?? 

Her response was that the insurance they had on file (from my husband's visit there three or four years ago) was under hubby's name so they thought it would be okay. I advised her that, first of all, the policy she was referring to had been canceled years ago and that the family has been under my company policy for over two years now. And second, billing an insurance company is a little different than sending an individual a bill without any sort of communication much less permission.

She told me I'd have to come into the office and update my stepson's insurance information and pay the bill and then they would submit it to insurance to reimburse me. I told her that the divorce agreement states that my husband pays the insurance premiums, but deductibles or costs for medically necessary procedures, emergency visits etc. are split 50/50. Non essential services are at the discretion of the individual parent, and we hadn't given permission for any of this. And frankly, I shouldn't have to be explaining this to her because she should know better than to send bills to people who aren't even in the office or in communication with the doctor. 

The office manager proceeded to tell me that ""it wasn't fair"" to charge the ex and then submit to insurance for reimbursement (this office doesn't collect from insurance, apparently, they submit for insurance to pay the policy holder back after the bill is paid) because the insurance company would send the check to me and I might just keep it. I told her that's wildly insulting to suggest and, frankly,  none of her business anyway. She's not in a position to dictate how we handle the financial specifics of the divorce. 

She repeatedly insisted my husband and I are liable for this bill, so before I head to the office and handle this in person, I wanted some advice. Does the doctor's office have a leg to stand on here? I just don't understand how a person who is not authorized to speak or spend on our behalf can just tell a business to send us an invoice?",legaladvice

"Found Hidden Camera in AirBnb (Seattle, WA)","My bf and I are staying at an airbnb in Seattle, we're basically living in the bottom unit (basement) and the hosts are directly above us. Everything seemed fine. Last night I went to use the charging cube and cable they had in the kitchen, for some reason it wasn't charging my phone so I took a closer look at it and saw that it was blinking. We shined a flashlight on the cube and realize it was one of those hidden camera charging cubes. It was in the kitchen but pointed straight at the bathroom, which means it has footage of us undressing (completely naked) and walking into the bathroom to shower. 



The hosts never informed us about this and we are really uncomfortable with the fact that it has footage of us without our consent. We contacted Airbnb but they are not super helpful and now we are considering calling the police to file a report. Is it legal for us to take the files from the cube (direct USB connection)? 


update 1: We called the police non emergency line, they won't give us an ETA or when they are coming but we have to wait for them. We only have 2.5 hours left until we have to check out . . . so I guess we will sit tight until then

Update 2: the couple left and went somewhere while we waited for the police. The police eventually did show up, made a report, took the camera as evidence, and tried to get a hold of the couple but couldn't. All my messages between myself and the host were wiped from the Airbnb app, I did not screen shot them but have copies of what the host said in my email. We are going to Mt Rainier for the next two days so I will keep you guys posted after. 

Update 3: Airbnb messages are back and I have full access now, will screen shot and keep safe! Thanks for all the advice and support, I'm just glad the police came and took care of it from there. Will look into lawyers once I'm back. Entering mt rainier now, will update later. 

Update 4: the host has contacted me and apologized stating that they did not know it was a camera and that some other guest had left it behind, they seemed a little upset and offended we would accuse them of such things. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that what he said was true. Airbnb refunded me the entire stay without me even asking and have temporarily suspended the host. They are starting their investigation and will communicate with the police. The police are still trying to see if they can get data off the device and are still doing their investigation. So that's where I'm at, it'll probably be a while before anything happens so I will make a separate update post when everything is settled. Thanks for the support everyone, it's been pretty terrifying and now I'm paranoid at every place I stay but I'm trying my best to just think of it as an isolated incident! ",legaladvice
"Former grad student, considering suing my university for $14k unpaid wages (Texas)","Long story short, I completed my graduate degree back in December and my graduate advisor still owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages for the work I did in their research lab during my last year of grad school. This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. The excuses for why I wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as I was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when I tried to talk to them. During the year where I wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. They lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. Multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me ""Hey, I thought you should know this is what Dr. Professor said about you, and I know that's not true"".

I contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. I gave Legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where I was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, I did, and then they did nothing. I informed them that this professor has done this to at least three other students over the course of at least five years. One of the other students had to drop out because, unlike me, they didn't have any external funding. I gave them piles of documentation, much of it taken from the university's own records, showing how the professor had falsified financial statements, employment records, grant proposals and reports, how the professor was paying students less than promised or nothing at all and using personnel money to buy equipment because they intentionally underestimated their equipment costs to make their grant proposal seem more competitive. University legal still did nothing. I contacted them again to ask if they needed any additional information from me, if they had planned or taken any corrective action, if they were planning on paying me my wages, no response of any kind.

Granted, they have been busy the past few weeks with coaches taking bribes from celebrities, but I spoke to them months before that. As far as I know, at this point my only option is to just sue the university directly. They have a massive legal department and they've argued in front of SCOTUS multiple times in the past few years, so I have no idea if or how I should approach this, but the simple fact of the matter is that this professor owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages, I have written statements promising me that amount, they slandered me in professional settings, and they're lying to the university and the federal government about how they're using research funds. What are the odds of suing a top-tier public research university with a multi-billion-dollar endowment and coming out ahead?  I'm in Texas if that's relevant.",legaladvice
"Apartment maintenance man saw me in a state of undress, put his finger in my mouth.","Throwaway because of how embarrassing this is for me. Also I'm in Pennsylvania. 

I moved into a new apartment complex at the beginning of August and have had no problems so far. A couple of weeks ago, I called maintenance to take care of peeling paint by my back door. A guy came, he fixed it, and I thought the issue was resolved.

Fast forward to today, I've been extremely sick since the weekend. Today I got back from class, took NyQuil, and just laid down to sleep. I closed my bedroom door as an extra buffer against the noise my neighbors across the hall can sometimes make. I'm a deep sleeper anyway and taking it made me pretty much dead to the world. I had a fever breaking so I got incredibly hot before the medicine kicked in, so I stripped down to just my panties.

These next bits I'm fuzzy on because I was sleeping and didn't witness them. A maintenance guy came back to ""finish my paint job"" and let himself in when I didn't answer the door.  He saw my keys and stuff in my living room so decided to check if I was okay. He let himself into my bedroom and saw me there asleep. My blanket had become a tangled mess so he got a full view of my chest. He then put his finger in my mouth to wake me up. 

I was immediately woken by the finger and this guy told me all of this in a rush while I was incredibly confused and groggy. Then I realized he could see me pretty much naked and screamed at him to get out. 

This happened just a few hours ago and I have no idea what to do. He might be telling the truth about being worried but it really bugs me he went into my bedroom. It bothers me more he put his finger in my mouth because it feels more sexual than just, say, shaking me or something, especially since I was undressed.

Killed my neighbor's dog [UPDATE],"Original [here]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3buv0v/neighbors_dog_killed_my_goats_i_killed_it_now_he/)

This all happened several months ago and it did get a bit exciting so I figured I would update as y'all seem keen on those.

Short story: I got more than I originally asked for.

Long story: neighbor got drunk and tried to drive his truck through my house (presumably. He hit a tree instead). Tree fell over onto my roof and destroyed it as well as quite a few electronics in the room under where the tree hit as it was raining quite hard at the time. Neighbor ended up with a broken leg, rib and arm. I got home a while after all this happened and found him still in his truck so I called an ambulance and sat there to make sure he wasn't going to die or try to do more damage. Anyway after it was all said and done his insurance wrote me a very large check for the roof and electronics and I got a court judgement for nearly what I was asking ($4500) for the goats and damage to the fence. I'm currently in talks with another lawyer to find out what it will take to get the tree replaced.

And the neighbor moved away. Don't know if it's just because he thinks I ruined his life or if he just sold his house to cover his costs. Frankly, I don't care. I just want him far away from me.",legaladvice
[Update] on contacting the child I gave up for adoption 12 years ago,"A new update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bpqws6/i_was_separated_from_my_child_12_years_ago_if/) and this first [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c5gn9y/update_to_my_post_about_contacting_the_child_i/) as some people asked (I hope this is OK and I'm not breaking the sub's rules). Thanks again to the people at r/legaladvice.

I wrote a letter to my ex-wife. I spare you the detail but in it I apologized for what I've done and took responsibility for it. I also told her that I've made efforts to better myself and how I got my act together, and that I'm aware that she only has my word as proof for it and I know that's not much. I asked if she would let me know how she and my son were doing and if she'd be willing to share a bit about his life. I asked if he knows about me and if she thinks there's a chance she would let me contact him at some point in the future. I also added that I won't make any further attempt at contact if she doesn't answer or if she asks me to stop.

I really wasn't sure she would answer but she did. It was a long and emotional letter. I don't want to say too much but she says she has forgiven me and she's glad I'm doing better. She, my son and her husband are doing well. My son is a happy young man, he's doing great in school and has a nice group of friends. She finds him very mature for his age, he knows what he wants to do with his future. He has a good relationship with his parents and siblings. Reading this has been a huge relief, I'm so glad he's doing well. She said I was right to give him up for adoption however difficult it may have been. I knew it but reading it from my ex-wife has been incredibly comforting.

My son knows he's adopted, and he knows why his mom left with him and why he's never met me. Apart from that he doesn't know much about me. He has asked a few questions over the years and his mother has answered truthfully, and she writes that she hasn't bad mouthed me and I believe her. As for contacting him in the future, she'll think about it, but she and her husband need to talk about it first and see if my son wants it. And obviously my ex-wife and her husband will need to talk to me to see if I've changed for real. She said that she needs time to think about it and she doesn't want to rush things, but whatever they decide in the end she won't keep me in the dark.

So now all I've got to do is wait. This is a positive outcome, knowing my son is doing great is what I had been hoping for all these years and it helps a lot, even more than I would have expected. Even if I'm not sure if there will be contact in the future, there's hope so that's fine.",legaladvice
UPDATE [MD] Condo Assoc. sent a letter citing inappropriate bylaws to restrict my kid from doing basically anything.,"OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c1ft6g/md_condo_assoc_sent_a_letter_citing_inappropriate/

The board meeting was yesterday. When the floor was opened to owner commentary, I raised my hand and told them that we'd moved in about 6 months ago and what I liked about the community before telling them about the letter and what it said. I ended with, ""When I got this letter, it made me feel like Community isn't a welcoming place for young families."" 

It turns out that the letter was sent out without the full knowledge and consent of the board. In fact, they had no idea that it was sent out. The president of the board was livid that I and 6 other families that I know of received this letter and told us that our kids were allowed and encouraged to play on their scooters and bikes on the sidewalk. They don't want the kids to play in the parking lots for their safety. They also ask that kids stay out of plantings and off the grass. Then she referred us to the playground that has several safety concerns and mentions the new layers of wood-chips that had been put down at the beginning of summer. 

I told her that while we appreciate the new layer of wood-chips I still had some safety concerns. 

* The end of the slide is about two feet off the ground and when my three year old goes down she shoots off the end like a cannon.

*The nylon covering on the climbing structure has come off and I'm worried my kids fingers could get hurt. 

*There's a strange lurid green fungus the size of a hockey puck by the swings. When you poke it it lets off spores and oozes. 

They'll have a contractor come out to give an estimate to fix the playground. 

The person that sent the letter was counting on us to be intimidated by official stationary, not to talk to each other, and discouraged by the inconvenient board meetings. I'm especially upset that six or seven families that I know of received this letter and four of them were renters/people of color. One person is a single man whose nephew visited him for a weekend and brought his bike. I plan on joining the board once I've been here a bit longer and implementing community-building events so that people don't feel so alone.

I called the SF police, they set up a Skype interview with a detective. Making the report took well over two hours. It was tough. But doing it at all felt like a personal victory. 

A few weeks later the detective emailed me to say that, unfortunately, the club's cameras were not helpful. They did catch something on a nearby apartment complex's front door camera though. The footage is too grainy to make much use of, but they were able to see his approximate height and build. If someone is caught doing something similar nearby with a similar build, they *might* be able to get him to confess to it.

Not very high hopes, but it's something. At least I can say that I tried.

"FINAL UPDATE: Toronto - Landlord let cleaners into my condo without consent. $1,700 worth of property stolen","What's up /r/legaldvice? I have received some messages from people asking about how this ended, so I'm back with my final update on this thing. You may recall my last two threads:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4cnlz7/toronto_landlord_let_cleaners_into_my_condo/
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4cse80/update_toronto_landlord_let_cleaners_into_my/ 

This is going to be long. There's  a tl;dr at the end.

After those threads, I felt like I was probably correct in pursuing the landlord, but the comments were a bit of a mixed bag of advice. As I said I would, I sought council here in town. I saw a paralegal that was supposedly in this area of law, referred through the Law Society. What an enormous waste of time.

After I explained the entire situation to the paralegal and how I didn't know if I should go after the property manager at the tenant board, or the cleaner in small claims, or both in small claims; the guy basically despondently nodded and said, ""Yeah… That's a real tough one… What do you want to do?""

It was frustrating that a legal professional in Toronto couldn't give me any better direction than Reddit. I left no wiser than I arrived, and decided to just go through the process with the LTB and feel it out. It didn't feel worth my time or money to seek additional council.

There was a preliminary hearing at the LTB in April where the property manager and I were each allowed to give our version of events, attempt mediation, and then the board member would determine if the case would go to a formal hearing. After telling my side of things, the property manager didn't dispute any of the events. The board member said that the cleaner was an agent of the landlord, and advised the property manager they would be required to pay any damages to me that may be awarded. This was very good to hear, as it finally confirmed I was correct to go after the property manager and not the cleaner.

The property manager was cooperative and was pleasant enough to deal with. The board member asked us if we would attempt a settlement. So far, the cleaner had offered $600. The PM said they would add $400 to that for a total of $1,000. I said I would not take less than the full value of my items listed, because I was confident I could prove their value beyond what they offered at a hearing. No settlement was agreed on. That was unsurprising and made sense to me. Even though the PM was not contesting the events and was likely going to be ruled against in a formal hearing, it was in their interest to make me prove the value of my stuff and get an order from the board for that amount. Then they could use the order to sue the cleaner later. If they settled it could be difficult to get the money from the cleaner.

At the end of the preliminary hearing, the board member took down a ""Statement of Agreed Facts"" to expedite our next hearing, since we didn't disagree on any of it. I'm not going to list them, but the gist of it is that they gave their copy of the key to my apartment to a third party without my consent and they removed my belongings from my apartment. It was very clear they weren't fighting me on that.

The formal public hearing where the board would determine damages was a couple months later. I had receipts (mostly Paypal confirmation emails) for about $1,200 worth of my things that were taken. Then I had $400 worth of stuff where I had pictures of me wearing it with identifying brand markings and stuff showing, with print outs from web sites where it could be purchased to show the monetary value. Then about $200 worth of stuff where all I had was pictures because they were irreplaceable items that I paid cash for. I had my girlfriend as a witness to what was taken and to confirm brands of clothing items. The full value of the items was over $1,800.

I was expecting to be awarded $1,200 at least for the items I could prove exactly how much I paid for, which is why I didn't settle for $1,000, but wasn't confident about the rest of it. 

Before the hearings for the day started, the board member called out our names and said ""Are you sure you can't settle this one with the mediator this morning? I'm looking at the agreed facts here and…"" He looked over at the landlord and kind of shrugged as if to say the hearing is a formality at this point. Nonetheless, the landlord wouldn't budge on it, so we waited 4 hours until we were called up for our hearing.

After we went through all of the documents item-by-item, the property manager was given the floor. He tried to dispute the items that did not have receipts – specifically a pair of jeans worth over $300 (Yes, seriously.) The board member said that it's not a criminal case, and it's not up to me to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every single item I listed (Referenced *Maldonado v. M.E.I.,* [1980]). The burden of proof I had to meet for a civil matter like this was met through what I had provided. As the PM elected not to bring any experts, witnesses, etc. that could argue against the values I had stated, or to say the items I was wearing in the pictures did not match the products in the evidence I produced, he had no reason not to believe me. The board member said he did not even want to hear from my witness, because the evidence I produced was substantial, and there was no contest from the property manager beyond ""it's not a receipt"".

The board member ruled in my favour for the full amount that we discussed for each item at the hearing, and I received the order stating such a week or so later in the mail. On my way out of the hearing I asked the landlord what they were going to do. He said they had no interest in fighting it and would be getting the cleaner to pay for it.

A week or two later I received the cheque in the mail, from the cleaner. This was a few months ago now, the cheque cleared and the matter is resolved.

Thanks to everyone that offered their advice and comments in the other threads.

**tl;dr:**  Had a hearing at the tenant board and won. I didn't have receipts for everything but the board member ruled that it's not a criminal case and I didn't have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt what the value of my belongings were. I provided enough evidence combined with the fact that it was uncontested by the landlord, so I was awarded the full replacement cost of everything I lost - over $1800.

Should I call the cops on my parents?,"So my parents are pretty shitty but definitely not the worst. They've been doing hard drugs since before I was born and have done so most of my life(I think they still are) causing us to move around a bunch (we now live in North carolina and originally in Pennsylvania). And I understand that addiction is hard to overcome but I feel that since they have 3 kids they need to stop and become better people

 Currently they live in a decent sized house BUT it's completely trashed. I mean there is literal garbage everywhere, tons of mice in every room, dog shit and piss in some places. The mice problem is so bad we can't really even have food in the house or else they will eat it and we don't have a working fridge so that's not an option either. We would get fed fast food once a day outside a school. I recently dropped out of school and moved to my brother's house(I'm 16 my brother is 20). And it wouldn't be my concern that they lived like that if it was just them but my 12 year old brother lives there and so do their two dogs. I just feel so bad for them and they don't deserve to be living in that house. 

My parents are completely neglectful to me and my brothers. They get drunk almost every night, they smoke weed and are possibly doing more drugs than that. We haven't been to any sort of doctors in 5 years because we don't have medical insurance for whatever reason. 

We have tons of family members but they live in a different state but any one of them would be happy to take my brother if absolutely necessary so I'm not worried about what would happen to him if the police were involved. I've tried calling CPS several times but everytime that happens they let me parents know they're coming before hand and somehow make the place decent so they see nothing wrong with our living situation. 

So I guess I just want some people's opinions on if I should call the police

Edit: I now have tons of pictures of what the house looks like 99% of the time. So I have actual proof of it. 

Edit 2: I do plan on going back to school. I only dropped out because I have really bad depression and anxiety and couldn't deal with living at my parents and also the stress of keeping my grades up and having a social life

Can I file for a restraining order for an ex-girlfriend that hasn't left me alone for almost five years (since we broke up),"Hey!
Just a bit of backstory, I dumped this girl in ninth grade after she committed credit card theft (Just her parents' card, but spent almost $1000). Obviously if she'd steal from her parents, she'd steal from her boyfriend. She's never let it go. No other boyfriends, and got into crazy amounts of trouble at school afterwards. In senior year, she was busted for sending nudes of herself to minors, from fellow seniors (Myself, 17 at the time, included) all the way down to seventh graders. (She was 19 at the time) School covered it up, even with copious amounts of proof. She was let off without even a suspension. Nonetheless, she's never stopped contacting me. Every two months or so, she'll try to text me with a new number or social media account or email. I block them constantly, but it's like cutting the head off of a hydra. Two more replace it. She's constantly belittled me, made fun of my mother's death, lied to girlfriends I had, saying we slept together and such, and basically done everything she can to ruin anything that makes me happy, and I'm tired of it. She emailed my college email account the other day, as we both go to the same community college, and I wrote up this reply, but before I sent it, I wanted to know if there is anything I should/ shouldn't say.

Julia,

Listen, I'm going to be completely honest with you. I don't know why you keep trying to contact me. At the risk of coming off rude, Julia, I literally want nothing to do with you. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to see you. I just don't want you to be part of my life. I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings, but we broke up in ninth grade. We're done. Permanently. Please, for the love of god, find a new hobby. I've given you chances on top of chances and every time I try and reconcile with you, you fuck me over, and I'm really tired of it. Your opinion of me is the last thing I care about, so call me whatever you want, but I'm tired of you fucking up anything that makes me happy because you get some sick form of pleasure from it. Please don't contact me, my family, or my friends again. If you do, and I'm being 100% honest here, I will file for a restraining order. You're coming dangerously close to stalker territory, and I'm done. So, politely, fuck off.

Regards,
u/homelesscheeto

So, I guess my final question, are these acceptable grounds to file a restraining order? Or does she physically need to be stalking me or whatever. Any advice would be appreciated! (Going to school for Law so I'm curious to get some expert opinion here) Thanks :)

Can my dad really hire a bounty hunter to kidnap me from college and take me home? (MS/TN),"I'm a freshman at a good school in Tennessee. My dad is a really difficult guy and has just gotten worse since I left for school. To make a long story short, when I stopped checking in every day he started calling the dean, and when the dean's office stopped taking his calls he started showing up here. The school really had my back and banned him from campus. 

Now he's calling my friends and their parents and saying I have to come home (my mom won't take his calls anymore and the court won't make her). My dad says that I ""lack the legal standing for self-determination"" because I'm a minor, since in Mississippi you're a minor until you're 21. He says that he's hired a ""youth transportation service"" to ""escort"" me home. Like those people who kidnap gay kids in the middle of the night and take them to conversation camps. Bounty hunters for kids. 

I told him that the fugitive slave act is a goner and that I only have to obey the laws of the state I'm in, which designates me an adult with the right to remain unkidnapped. He said that I'm bound by the ""long arm statute"" and that I haven't even established residency in Tennessee because I've only been here since mid-August and I'm still registered to vote in Mississippi. 

So I guess my main question is my title: is he right, can he really send someone to kidnap me and take me back to Mississippi? My mom says this is just him being crazy and trying to intimidate me but obviously I want to cover all my bases.

If he's wrong, what can I do if that actually does happen? If some guy comes up to me and zipties my hands and says I have to go with him, do I? Can I fight back? If my friends are nearby and see me being kidnapped, can they help me? Since the episode that got my dad banned from campus, I've had a couple hefty guy friends offer to walk me back and forth from class. If one of them is with me and someone tries to take me, do they have to just let it happen, or do they have a right to help me not get kidnapped?

I think that's all my questions for now. Thanks!

Tl;dr: stopped talking to dad and he says he's going to have a bounty hunter bring me back to Mississippi because there I'm still technically a minor/child. Can he really do that? ",legaladvice
"(Illinois) Neighbor, cut down a rare 150-year-old tree that has been in my family for generations.","Recently a great aunt of mine died, and we needed to send a week in Washington State, and we asked a neighbor to take care of our five cats, two dogs, and 100+ chickens. We came back this morning and my parents had dropped me off at school this morning straight from the airport before heading home. While my dad was inspecting the property, he noticed that our 150-year-old giant sequoia was gone. My Great-Great Grandfather had planted the tree after returning from California, and it's not native to Northern Illinois but with the right care it can survive, you just have to be careful about windburn in the winter. Now the tree itself isn't that large because it's still young and the winters here (like this one that won't end because we have fucking snow in April) stunt its annual growth. Upon the first confrontation, the neighbor admitted he had cut it down but upon further questioning will say nothing/denies doing it at all and my parents really have no idea what to do from here, and I want to be able to help them.

My toddlers grandmother stealing his identity?,"Just to give a little back story I have a son who is a year and half old. Me and his mother are no longer together but he lives with me now. Before he lived with me about 4 months ago, he was living in Florida with his mother and her mom. 

Her mother is notorious for stealing her children's identities, opening credit cards, putting bills in their names. Stuff like that. So it occurred to me that I dont have his social security number card. I asked his mother if she took it to Florida with her and she told me her mother stole it from her. 
Obviously this is a concern to me. I thought maybe I could check his credit on credit karma or something to see if shes used it yet but he isn't old enough for me to check that way. 

Is there a way for me to check if shes using his ssn? If not is there some way I can preemptively report her for stealing his identity even if I'm not sure that shes used it yet?

If it's important, I know that she has a warrant out for her arrest for violating probation in North Carolina, thats why she moved to Florida.",legaladvice

"2nd Update for ""My teenage son is being sexually groomed""","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/62hwid/my_teenage_son_is_being_sexually_groomed/)
[First Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/69aro6/update_my_teenage_son_is_being_sexually_groomed/)

This is to carry on the timeline and process for anyone else in a similar predicament. It's insanely long but hopefully thorough. 


We got an update from the detective a couple of days ago and I think things have come to a conclusion. I am so impressed with him and all he has done for us. I don't know if y'all will like how this is going to play out but we very much understand the ""reality"" of this situation. It's infuriating but indicative of the society we live in, especially in the south.


I want to clarify some details for ease of understanding the big picture. The person who was grooming my son is a woman around age 40. My son is age 15, turning 16 later this year. 


We've learned that predators have specific victims that they exploit; absent parents, kids with troubled backgrounds, low self esteem, access to the child, etc. On the surface, my son seemed perfect to groom.


We adopted him when he was 14 years old after only knowing him one month. He is black and we are white. He had a completely shitty childhood concerning his environment and people who raised him. Thank whatever higher power that he is the complete opposite of his upbringing. He has busted his ass to climb out of that hellhole and has succeeded every step of the way. This child has raised himself, we just give him the tools he needs to succeed faster. We gave him a complete fresh start with no attachments to his old life. We are not, by ANY fucking stretch, knights in shining armor, all accolades go to him. All we did was throw him a life preserver, he has done all the swimming. It is a privilege and joy to share his life, he is extremely humble, kind, generous, and stunningly well adjusted. He conducts himself with more grace and tact then any person I've ever known. 


He loves us and his new siblings fiercely, loyally, and very protectively. We feel the exact same towards him. This is our child, he is from our hearts, if not our bodies.


See, that's where Sick Bitch fucked up. She mistook his independence and our trust in him as indifference. Despite circumstances, our kid is a far, far cry from a 'troubled youth'. If anything, he is vulnerable, not an aggressor. She had no fucking clue of the depth and strength of our family. She didn't know the private side of our family life, only the public. She thought he was easy picking and, in a way, he was an ideal target. He has had to learn what is appropriate from parental figures and learn how healthy family relationships operate. He never had that growing up, he didn't know what is ""normal"" so he was easy to manipulate using a maternal approach. This is how he missed so many blatant red flags.


Her life: very attractive white woman, happily married for quite a while, strong leadership and ties in the local church, college degree, works with children... You get the picture.


Here's what it comes down to and I'll attempt to explain it accurately. In order to charge her with Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, there has to be ""intent"".The detective was unable to prove ""intent"". From what I understand, all of the grooming that she was doing must be for the purpose to promote a sexual relationship. Since there was no physical contact or her asking, saying, or obvious instigation that her actions were towards establishing sexual contact, ""intent"" can not be proven.  She was interrupted with her toe on the line. If this hadn't been caught at the precise point that it was, the detective is positive that she would have progressed much further. I am counting blessings over here.


Both sides of their stories, timeline, and events matched up perfectly. Her defense? She says that she had a huge lapse in judgement and it's being horribly misconstrued. She claims that she was acting as a friend, got caught up in a teenage mentality, feels horrible about the whole thing, blah, fucking blah, fucking blah.  EVERYBODY agrees that she was grooming our kid, no shadow of a doubt, it just didn't go far enough to prove sexual intent. We couldn't prove that she wanted to have sexual relations, only that she was viewing sexual material with him and discussing sexual subjects. Of course that is a relief but at the same time, I'm infuriated.


Hopefully someone with a better grasp of the law can explain this and make it easier to understand. We understand, it's just hard to put into words!


We were told that the DA's decision to move forward would heavily depend on our wishes. Moving forward would be weighed on proven evidence and on my son's testimony. The detective very tactfully and compassionately voiced our unspoken thoughts (my summation not his); It would be so fucking easy for a defense lawyer to make this my son's fault. Black, athletically fit, minor with a broken history, alone with a white woman who was scared or coerced into playing along. Upstanding white woman, relentlessly apologetic with hordes of people to testify of her integrity. Deep community ties up against the new kid in town.


It would be a breeze to turn preconceptions and insinuations into the ""truth"".


I cannot elaborate on this anymore it is too fucking enraging and horribly corrupt. I will leave all the rage to be explored in the comments... I could fill a novel.


If this were my decision to make, I'd do my best to destroy the bitch. However, this is my son's life - he would effectively be blamed during a trial, his life and history up for display, our family and parenting gutted and picked apart, and once again, he would live with constant stress and humiliation. Right now this is a private situation. If it became public, he is terrified of the teasing, hatred, condemnation, and frustration of exposing this person. Plus, we all know how this situation plays out in regards to older woman ""fantasies"" and the hypocrisy of how female predators are perceived.


At this point, kiddo's life has never been better and he is terrified to jeopardize his security and happiness. He has already paid dearly for shitty adults that abused him and he is adamant that he does not want to be the sacrificial lamb. He says does not want to give up his hard fought peace in the name of justice. We completely understand and support his decision.


We have spoken with the DA and have mutually decided to not pursue this due to the detriment it would cause our son.


During the conversation, the detective walked me through the steps in his investigation. He works the second shift so the majority of his legwork is conducted during the early evening hours. He asked me to read between the lines and understand that he had to remain professional and unbiased. He is a family man.


- She was provided a ride for all 3 of the interviews, conducted at times of his choosing and convenience



- All phones, personal computers, and other evidence was collected by several officers during late afternoon, early evening hours. It took around two hours. All of the spouses electronics were confiscated as well.



- Interviews were VERY intense and very very thorough. He elaborated more than this and it was VERY satisfying to hear.



- She was asked and had to account for every single video, message, and other evidence that was found on her devices. All the evidence corroborated my son's story perfectly, no discrepancies at all.



There were some more things but this is already insanely long. If anyone has experience with police investigations and can add anymore to this, please do!


All things said, more good came from this than harm. Though her actions were deliberate efforts to cause pain and destroy, the outcome brought forth love, compassion, and knowledge. My son now has even more strong, kind, and resourceful mentors in his life. Fuck her, she lost.


Thank you all so very much. Your kindness, support, and advice has been a huge source of comfort for me. Much love to all.

An extra organ removed without consent/notice,"In 2009, while active\-duty in the Marine Corps, I had an appendectomy at the naval hospital on Camp Pendleton. The procedure was unremarkable and I went about my life as normal for awhile. Recently, I started having strange pains in my abdomen. Fearing the worst, I ended up getting a CT scan. One of the notes from the scan was ""surgical clips present from a cholecystectomy \(gallbladder removal\)"". 

Not having a gallbladder is news to me. No one told me it was removed. I've had digestive issues since then consistent with gallbladder removal, but I wrote it off as years of MREs and stress.

[UPDATE] - California - Douche with a train horn on his truck - I am not at fault,"California 

Original post here - https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bea5yk/california_involved_in_accident_caused_by_prank/

My car was towed pretty quickly after the accident, and once I gave my statement, my wife picked me up and took me to the auto shop that I asked the tow truck driver to take the car to. 

So my insurance is going to sue the guy for the cost of the repair, my adjuster is not pleased with the situation. He met me at the auto shop a couple days after the accident, and he was just shaking his head all the while saying ""this is so freaking stupid...a train horn?! REALLY!?"" Right now I am looking at $7,400 worth of damage on my 2017 S60 T6 Volvo. I love this car and am so pissed that it has been in an accident! 

Tiny Dick Truck Douche actually had his car towed and impounded because he disabled the factory horn, therefore according to the police, his car was ""lacking basic safety equipment required by California law"" and was not ""road worthy."" Petty I know, but oh so satisfying! 

The main responding cop called me this AM to tell me all of this, and that I, along with the guy I hit (he did indeed hit car #3) will not be ticketed. They concluded that involuntary jerk of the wheel due to hearing a train horn next to our cars was what caused the accident. 

We will likely be summoned to court to testify against this guy in some kind of criminal trial. The cop went on to tell me that wrote him up for everything he possibly could. Cop gave me a brief rundown, I do not remember it all, but his exhaust was illegally modified, he did not have mudflaps, his tint was too dark...sounds like they went through his car with a fine toothed comb. 

They gave him a couple other tickets pertaining to being the cause of the accident, basically loud horn disturbed the peace, creating unsafe driving conditions, etc. 

So apparently this guy is ""known"" in the area. Calls have been made before about a dark colored, lifted truck making a loud horn noise, and the cops know all about him. This seems like it was their chance to finally nab him and his childish antics. 

Don't know what is going to happen to my insurance rate, but at least no points on my license!

So I am sure it will be sometime before I have a final update, but that's what's going on with me.",legaladvice
[FL][MIAMI][UPDATE]Being sued for having topless photos of a minor in my bar who claimed to be 21,"Thank you very much to everyone who responded. I really appreciate your all giving up time to do this. This is part update (first chunk) and then answers to questions (second chunk). 

So I lawyered up with a decent firm I've used before, and a day or two subsequently I was officially served with notice I am being sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress.

I didn't state it in my first post because I thought it was not relevant but if any of the girls want to remove their poster they just need to let me know and it will be taken down immediately – although obviously they lose their free month of drinks. This is clearly written on the form they signed, which they all have a copy of. So I knew from the start it wasn't a case of regret and the girl wanting the poster down. 

One of the first things my lawyer did was check with the girl's firm if it was real and not a scam as several posters had suggested. Unfortunately, it was a real case, they provided all the documentation and stuff. It gets worse. They also sent him a scan of the girl's passport and birth certificate when he asked, both confirming she is 16. They'll be brought up in the lawsuit so there's no question of them also being fakes. I checked her real info provided by the lawyers and compared it with the form and [as I now know] fake driving license she gave me. She used the same address on the fake ID but just changed her last name. It is clearly the same girl in both photos. 

She doesn't want to bring the police into it and wants just a civil case. My lawyer met with hers and, just as /u/thewhitenashorne and other FL attorneys had suggested, made noise about how her possessing a fake ID is a felony and how about she just drop the suit and we stay even stevens unless she wants the police involved, but her lawyer basically told mine that it would be far worse for me if we got the police involved because of it being a naked minor, and also the threat of having my liquor license taken away, like basically as my lawyer explained it they have two cards to play (photos of a minor naked, potential confiscation of liquor license) and I have one of a much lower value (girl has a fake ID that's only a DL, not a passport or green card).  

Anyway, I have removed the poster and have locked it and the memory card with all the photos in the safe. 

I have had warnings in the past at the first bar I owned to ID more strictly (I'm from Europe where we're more relaxed) and at this one too but we ask for a driving license/passport for everyone now so the police are happy. The guy telling me I accept fake IDs is wrong: I just do the bare minimum when it comes to accepting licenses because my business is serving alcohol to college kids, not being border patrol.  To the poster who asked, I have no idea whether or not it is allowed but loads of FL clubs and bars confiscate fake ID, particularly during spring break. 

To reiterate since some people were double checking this – yes, I collected and photocopied ID from all of the girls concerned alongside the forms they filled out. It is easy to match the forms with the relevant posters since I can compare the ID and the poster photo. 

I have notified the photographer although he is not named in the lawsuit. He told me he has insurance against this exactly for this sort of thing (he's an erotic photographer) so wasn't too bothered as I had done checks and asked for ID. The photos weren't in his online portfolio as I had paid extra so I had sole ownership of the photos – he has no copies. 

I have checked with my insurers who will indeed cover this. The fact I have consent forms and proof of age made them and my lawyer a lot more happy. 

While some bars do indeed let younger people in, my bar's policy is always 21+ only. The only way that girl got in was with a fake ID – she should not have been there legally. 

On an non legal point – I have received several abusive PMs about this competition, calling me a paedo, a rapist, a ""scumsucking sleazoid"" and so on. This competition was completely legal and completely consensual. I have run these sorts of competitions before in my bar every couple of years and have never had any problems yet. I appreciate that the bars some of you may frequent are not run on the same model or are higher class that mine, but bars like mine work this way. Cheap alcohol at a bar near frat and sorority houses means I make a killing and this just encourages business. If you disapprove that I don't own an expensive trendy hipster bar aimed at young professionals, serving pumpkin spiced craft beer with Lena Dunham quotes on the walls, just ignore the post. Don't PM me a load of self moralising abusive bullshit.

I have also received two PMs asking me where exactly my bar is in Miami since they fancy coming for a drink. It doesn't seem wise to reveal this stuff on the web – particularly in the middle of all this -  so sorry, no. 

That's all for now. Obviously if anything happens I will update at the end of the case. My lawyer has said I should hold fire on updating you till then. Thank you all once again for your help.

Superintendent left all my stuff and a bill for new locks on apartment building lawn. No eviction notice given.,"I live in Louisiana. Yesterday when I came from work I my furniture and all my stuff was on the lawn of my apartment building. I went to my apartment and the key wouldn't work. I went to speak with the superintendent and he said I had been evicted. I was not given any notice, I have lived in this building for six years with no complaints, have always paid my rent on time, I just renewed my lease for a year in July and I already paid the rent for September. He said I wasn't getting my September rent or my deposit back because he had to pay to change the locks and for movers to come and get my furniture out of the apartment. There was also a bill for the rest of the outstanding costs with my stuff. He told me I had until night fall to get my stuff off the lawn or he would call the police. I did call the police but they said it was a 'civil' matter. He is also withholding my mail until I pay the outstanding bill he says I owe. 

One of my neighbors was nice enough to guard my stuff but someone made off with my TV and my cookware. I called a friend to come help me take my stuff since I didn't want any more of it to get stolen.  I stayed at the friend's place as well last night. I have proof that I paid the lease for the year and that my September rent was paid. I was never given any notice. I called the company that owns the building and despite speaking with three different people I was told they won't intervene in a dispute between a tenant and a superintendent. A couple of neighbors have texted me that the woman now living in my apartment is pregnant and probably dating the superintendent. She told one of them she didn't want to live on the top floor (where there are open apartments)  so her 'hunny' gave her this one instead. I have no idea what to do now because the police and the building owners won't listen or help me, I'm practically homeless, some of my stuff was stolen and I can't even get my mail.",legaladvice

The lawyer told me that I probably won't need to do anything else as they were handling it and to stay as far away from the ""doctor"" as possible.

&#x200B;

If this was the end of it I wouldn't have even come back. Here I am so something happened. And boy, was it satisfying. I submitted complaints to the board that licenses chiropractors and physical therapists after my last post. along with a harsh email to the company the PT was working for. Well, this last Friday I got a email from said company apologizing. They said that the PT who refereed me to him is ""no longer with us"" and ""Will not be practicing in the near future"". Along with this, on ""doctor"" Dave's Facebook page they released a statement saying that they will not be taking new patients for the foreseeable future 

&#x200B;

So, it seems that, for the time being, these two won't be pulled the shit they had with me. A win-win.

My tenant cut down trees in my yard. Including my apple tree,"We live in BC Canada.  

So here's the story. 

Renters moved in May 15. They asked that we take the house off the market, they will sign a two year lease and pay $2000 a month, $100 more than we were asking for. Immediately they were late paying rent and since then, have not paid rent on time once. Numerous messages every month with excuses as to why rent couldn't be paid on time.  June 7 he asked me to pay someone to care for the yard because they couldn't afford a lawn mower. I reminded them that it was in the rental agreement that they care for the yard because we are 10 hours away and that we need a somewhat self sufficient tenant. More months of late rent and complaints about small issues which we immediately attended to by sending someone in (furnace filter needed changing, toilet ring needed replacing in both bathrooms, dryer needed to be cleaned) 

July 21 he messages me about pruning the trees and cutting and getting rid of them. I clearly stated in text that he was not allowed to cut the trees down. 

Sept 14 we have friends come visit and tell us our grass is about 3 feet tall so I send this message to my tenant ""Hey Chris, could you please now the lawn or at least pay someone to mow it and clean it up. Just got a call from a neighbor concerned that the place isn't being cared for. Said the lawn was out of control""

He proceeds to bitch that the yard has been a disaster since he moved in in the spring and that he shouldn't have to do a dump run for the garbage in the yard. The ""garbage"" I explained were painted decorative tires for growing potatoes with the garden and if he wasn't going to use them he could store them in one of the 3 sheds but to not throw them out. 

Today Oct 3 he sends me pictures saying he cleaned up the yard and I see that my apple tree in the front yard is missing and the choke cherry tree in the back yard is also missing. He did NOT have permission to cut them down, I explained this to him and he says ""I did not touch either of the big trees anymore than I showed you a couple of months ago and you had no problem then. If you are not happy I apologize but you told me to deal with the yard so I dealt with it so that I was happy with the way the yard looked. Sorry we didn't know the tree in the front yard was to stay. We checked it and it hadn't produced anything. ""

We pruned the apple tree end of last summer so of course it won't produce apples this season!!

Now he is trying to get out of his lease by telling me to evict him but I want repayment for my trees. It was stated in the least that they weren't allowed to remove any permanent fixtures pertaining to the property without written consent from us.

My (18F) anti-vaxx mom (34F) refuses to give me my documents that I need to get vaccinated and encourages my family to harass me.,"Hello Reddit, I don't quite know if this is the right place to post this but I appreciate any help I can get. (I'm sorry about my English.)

I recently turned 18 and until now, my mother still had all my documents like my birth certificate, my bank account stuff, and of course my vaccination certificate. I never had any problem with that because I knew she kept it safe and didn't misuse it to hurt me or something. At least until now. 

A bit of backstory; I was vaccinated as a baby, but sometime in between then and now, my mother got it into her head that vaccines are harmful. My mom's pretty naive, the kind of person that reads something on FB and assumes it must be true and doesn't actually look up sources or even google anything, ever. Because of that, she thinks vaccines cause mental illness, don't help, are all just a big gimmick by the pharma industry, you get what I mean. Obviously I learned about vaccines in biology and I informed myself about them so I know that's all bs.

When I was 14 and knew it was about time my vaccinations get refreshed, I asked my mom to go to the doctor with me to get them, but my mom refused to allow me. ""You can do what you want when you're 18,"" she said. Thing is, I turned 18 recently, and the first thing I looked into was finally getting my vaccinations. I got infected with whooping cough last year,  it was the worst 7 weeks of my life and I had injuries along my ribs because of it that took an entire month to heal.

It could have been prevented if I had just been vaccinated and I want to take those precautions concerning my health now. So I made an appointment with my doctor for the 25th this month. I assumed it wouldn't be a problem, because I'm 18 now and there's nothing my mom can do to stop me. Or so I thought.

She is vehemently refusing to hand over my vaccination certificate which my doctor said I should bring with me. We've had a lot of fights about it, and no matter what I say or how many facts about vaccines I tell her, she isn't listening to anything because I ""have no life experience"" and she ""knows a doctor from her anti-vaxx FB group who says vaccines cause autism"". 

She vague posted about me in her anti-vaxx FB group, talking about her ""poor child with no life experience who's blinded by the pharma industry"". She also talked about me with people in our family that have the same views as her. Since then, random FB people I don't know and members of my own family have been constantly sending me messages and even calling me, trying to talk me out of getting vaccinated and telling me I'm stupid. I feel like I can't go to family gatherings anymore because I will be harassed and put on the spot and my mother would encourage it.

I just want to get vaccinated in peace! But she won't give me my vaccination certificate and the 25th is getting closer. So I wanted to ask; Is what she is doing illegal? And in the likely case she won't give me my documents in the next few days, can I still get my vaccinations without it? I don't actually intend to press any charges against my mother, I would have nowhere to go and no money without her. But maybe I can pressure her into giving me the documents if iI tell her she's committing a crime.

Edit1: I'm from Germany. 

Edit2: Thank you everyone for the replies and the support! I appreciate all the help <3

Edit3: I'm blown away by all the support you have shown me Reddit. Thank you so much guys! To everyone worried about my bank account, I have already made a new one. Before turning 18 I had an account for minors that my mother had access to. She has never abused this or taken money from me. When I turned 18 I made a new one which only I have access to, so no worries :)

Update: charged $1700 for lab work that insurance denied as medically unnecessary. Fixed!,"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az3yna/doctor_sent_me_to_get_bloodwork_at_an_innetwork/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Edit: this is in California

I just wanted to start of by saying thank you to everyone who commented and gave advice! I really appreciate all the help. 

Here's what I ended up doing:

I called my own insurance company to find out why it was denied. I found out that, because of my dad's specific insurance plan, I was supposed to go to a specific doctor's office and lab for my yearly checkup and bloodwork that is near my parent's house because the insurance has a specific contract with them. I didn't go there because I live a few hundred miles away. However, my address is listed as my parent's address so the insurance company thought I lived nearby. They said I could appeal with an address change but the woman on the phone was very upfront and said that those never get approved. She said that, if I could get my doctor to change the billing code (just like all of you said!! You noble wonderful people) then the insurance company would review it. She also said that the old code had to be removed and a new one put in place. The new billing couldn't have both codes on it. 

So! I went to my doctors office and brought in my bill. The admin at the front was so sympathetic and understanding and promised to take care of it within the next few days. I told her everything hat the insurance lady told me, and she wrote it all down and clipped it to a copy of my bill. She said that the diagnostics place never even sent them my results! By that Friday, she had gotten my results and had me come in to find what they were, resubmitted he claim to insurance, and put a hold on all payments until it was figured out. 

Today, I got my new bill in the mail. All of the bloodwork was covered. My new bill is $0.00.  I cried all over the place, you guys. 

I'm planning on bringing that admin a thank-you card and maybe a Starbucks card and flowers. Hopefully she's allowed to take them. 

Thank you all SO much for all of your advice and help. You are all the best!! You literally helped me from having to pay 10% of my yearly wages! Plus, I started saving up in preparation for having to pay this bill so now I have the beginnings of a little nest egg/emergency fund just in case something happens in the future. Again, you guys rock. ",legaladvice
My almost 3 month old daughter has been subpoenaed to testify in a criminal case,"Last Thursday a process server came to our house and served a subpoena for a criminal case on my daughter, who was born on April 15, 2015. I called the number on it to explain how it must be a mistake because my daughter is not even 3 months old yet but I was told there was no mistake and my daughter is required to appear as a witness to testify on the date shown on the subpoena. I went in person with my daughter to the DA's office and was told the same thing. My husband and I thought this might be a case of identity theft. She doesn't have a social security number yet because she was born at 29 weeks, spent 11 weeks in the NICU and has only been home from the hospital for 7 days so we haven't gotten around to it yet. We checked anyway just in case and one has not be created for her or issued to her. Nothing with her credit either. We called the police about it possibly being identity theft and they are looking into it but so far there is nothing and they also told us the subpoena is legitimate.  So we are very confused. My daughter has a rare and uncommon first, middle and last name, so it is very doubtful that there someone else with her exact name. When I called the number on the subpoena and went to the DA's office I was told both times that if she doesn't show up for court a warrant will be issued for her arrest. Would the police actually arrest a baby for not showing up in court? Or would my husband and I as her parents be arrested instead? Does anyone have an explanation for what is happening here or any advice as to what we can do to solve this? I swear I'm not trolling, I wouldn't believe this myself except it is actually happening to us. We are in California.",legaladvice
[NC] My wife will not allow my two young children [6 M and 8 F] to leave Mexico and come home. They have been living in Mexico for the last 2 weeks against my wishes. What can I do?,"So here is the run down.  I'll do my best to keep this as concise as possible.  I am a US citizen, but my wife is not.  We were married 10 years ago, and she was already staying here on an expired visa when we eloped.  Since she was here illegally, she was afraid for us to try to file the green card paperwork on our own due to concerns over possible immediate deportation.  

&#x200B;

We had two children \[6 M and 8 F\] together within two years of marriage.  We've had our ups and downs, and I think that the immigration issue drove a wedge between the two of us.  My wife has some undiagnosed mental issues, and even started practicing witchcraft in our home.  We filed for divorce four years ago, and it was an ugly situation.  She claimed that I abused our children, and fortunately, my step daughter from a prior marriage testified on my behalf.  Despite our issues, we were able to work through things, and we ended up not going through with the divorce.  That being said, when we received the deportation order, my wife, my children, and I were devastated.  I had to take personal time off from work, and my wife was so depressed that she couldn't get out of bed for several weeks.  Regardless, she returned to Mexico this past May to live with her family in Monterrey. 

&#x200B;

When she flew down to Mexico, she traveled with our two children and her daughter \[19 F\] from a previous marriage while I stayed here in the states to work.  The plan was for them to live down in Mexico for a month, learn the language, and get to know her relatives.  At the end of June, her daughter was supposed to come home on a flight with our two children.  When I arrived at the airport to pick them up, only her daughter walked off of the plane.  When I asked where the kids were, she stated that her mother/my wife wouldn't allow them to get on the flight.  I was dumbfounded.  I had no idea what to say, and we drove home in complete silence.  

&#x200B;

When I called her, she claimed that she didn't want to be without her kids, and that she wouldn't voluntarily allow them to come home.  I flew down to Monterrey a few days later and rented a room at a resort so that my wife, the kids, and me could spend some quality time together.  I thought that it would diffuse the situation, and I thought that I could talk her into letting me bring the kids home, under the agreement that we would return to Mexico, as a family, for routine visits.  Unfortunately, she would not agree to this, and I was forced to fly home by myself.    

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do here.  I haven't spoken to an attorney about this yet, and I don't know how the law surrounding this situation works.  Can my wife, a Mexican citizen, hold my kids, legal US citizens (as they were born in the US and have birth certificates), in Mexico against my will?  What is the best course of action for me to take to get my kids back home, assuming that there is something I can do to begin with?",legaladvice
(CA) Got hit by a driver who ran away and I just received a letter from a public defender asking me to remedy by civil compromise,"TL:DR - I was the victim in a hit and run. The guy got a misdemeanor hit and run and now a public defender wants me to remedy by civil compromise. If I do this, I am being told that the criminal case will probably be dropped. I don't want to sue him, I want him to be punished for his crimes and crappy behavior, but I don't really understand what I'm being asked to do. What should I do and what happens if I don't sign?   


In late August of 2018, I (31f) was stopped due to traffic on the 210 freeway in Pasadena around 2 pm on a weekday when I struck by a white pickup truck being driven by an older white male. The collision caused me to run into a white Mercedes being driven by an 30-something year old Asian man (he also had his infant son). During the collision, I hit my head really hard to the point where I went to the ER to get checked out for concussion. While I did not have a concussion, I did have a big bump and bruising, none of which I got pictures of. Furthermore, my 2008 Toyota Yaris was so damaged that the doors couldn't open properly and the car was totaled. 

&#x200B;

However, after the collision, both the pickup truck and the Mercedes moved over to the emergency lane (my car had been hit into the emergency lane already). The drivers side of my car of smashed closed, so I crawled over to the passenger side and had to push to get it open. I was disoriented but trying to keep my calm, so by the time I got out, the guy who hit me had gotten out of his truck and was approaching me. The first thing he said to me was ""those tin cars are so weak. You just tap them and they crumple"" as though he was annoyed with me. He also was clearly slurring his words and was very large and intimidating. I thought the best thing to do was to play nice and then call the police to get involved. So I told him that I hit my head and wasn't feeling well so I was going to call 911 and sit in my car because I might pass out. He clearly stumbled to the Mercedes, where the Asian man was getting out of his car. He was pulling out his son, who was crying. The white man  began talking, and the Asian man asked if he had been drinking (because the man also clearly smelled like alcohol) before putting his son back in the car. As the man put his baby back in the car, the white dude turned around and began stumbling back to his car. I remember thinking that the man who hit us was going to drive away, so I picked up a pen and wrote down the license plate and every detail possible on my arm. When he drove away, he flipped me off.   


So I connect with the Asian man who is okay, the cops get there and take our statements, the baby gets checked out and he's ok, and the cop directs me to drive my car off the freeway. Once it gets to the downslope of the off ramp, it becomes clear that my car can't turn and isn't functioning/dripping a lot of fluid, so we get a pickup truck to get it. My mom picks me up and takes me to the hospital because I have a big bump on my head. By the time we get out of the hospital, several hours later, the cops have found the man who hit and run. I go to the police station and correctly ID him.  


A few weeks later, I go to pick up the police report to find out if the man has insurance because my insurance company is having a hard time finding it out. In the police report, I find out that the man said that I hit the Mercedes and that he only stopped to make sure we were okay. However, because I had a witness and it was obvious that my car had been hit behind, he was charged with a misdemeanor hit and run. Furthermore, because it took several hours to find him, he did not have a high enough BAC to get charged with a DUI. He also has not turned in the truck and to my knowledge, his insurance company and the policy have never seen it. Finally, he did not tell the police he had insurance so it took my insurance company awhile to discover and contact his insurance company.  


My insurance company ended up giving my parents about $5k for the Toyota Yaris (my parents bought it for me for graduation and it was in their name), which they gave me to apply to a new car. His insurance company, who waited to work with me for almost two months because they could not get a statement from him (he has continued to deny he was involved), worked with me and paid for my medical bills for the ER visit, 12 hours of work time at $40/ hr (even though I make $75  as a private educator, they didn't like that I didn't have an employer with a time sheet to show missed work), and $500 for my struggle (which I didn't ask for but thought was cool).    


Then about a week ago, my parents and I got a letter from a public defender asking us to remedy by civil compromise. They gave me and my parents a paper to sign. It says:  


Civil Compromise:  


""I, wordsonlips, declare as follows: That I am the Victim in the above-entitled case. I will remedy by civil compromise. I do not wish to continue prosecution against the defendant. I have received restitution on behalf of the defendant, which fully compensates any losses sustained as a result of any actions of the defendant. Because full satisfaction has been made, I wish to have this case dismissed. I make this statement of my own free will and without any coercion, and I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.""  


My parents have the same form, just with their names on it. Included was a letter that says that if I sign this document, the state ""may"" drop his criminal case as well.   


I am not after any more money, and I looked up the man and I don't think he has anything of value anyway. However, this guy hit me and another man and a baby, knew that I was in distress and that a baby could be hurt, was definitely drunk whether the state acknowledges it or not, tried to blame me, and has done nothing to make the process easy on me or his own insurance company. I don't want to sign this, because I want him to face consequences for his actions and I want him to get help for his drinking. I want to make sure that I am contributing somewhat to preventing him from doing this again. And there is part of me that wants to tell my own story and call out this asshole to a judge.

&#x200B;

That being said: 

What exactly does this civil compromise mean and why am I being asked to sign this?

If I do sign, am I basically giving the state a reason not to pursue criminal charges?

If I don't sign, am I suing him and should I get a lawyer? Do I need to ask for money from him? Should I?  
If I don't sign, what am I getting myself into? Could I have years of court dates for a misdemeanor?    


My dad and I are going to call the public defender on Thursday, but any advice or knowledge will be greatly appreciated.

[UPDATE][PA] My neighbors were starving their chickens and ducks to death.,"This didnt get a lot of traction at all but for the like 2 or 3 people who responded.

The neighbor apparently told the cop that the chickens died from sharing a space with the ducks. Nothing will be done on that end. There were originally 4 chickens all together and all 4 died within 3 days. There are 3 ducks left. I went out today to offer to purchase the ducks from him to take them to a sanctuary that I found who would have taken them, but they apparently already found a new home for them. The new owners will be coming to pick them up on Wednesday, so hopefully they have a better life after this. The only Orgs that contacted me back were the ones that didn't deal with animal abuse/neglect to let me know they can't help, which I appreciated. I'm pretty upset about the lack of response from the SPCA. They haven't contacted us at all since the day before they said they would come out to investigate. I don't know, maybe one or 2 of the chickens could still be alive if they did. 

Apparently the wife is upset and going crazy about getting rid of the remaining ducks but she literally not once has left her house outside of going to work. She has never ever gone back there with the ducks and chickens. I'm pretty sure she has hoarding tendencies at this point and her husband enables her. The husband didn't seem at all phased we called the cops on him. I think he's just done with the whole situation to be honest.

So I failed at saving those poor chickens but I like to think since the cop came out that they decided to get rid of the ducks. So while the cop didn't seem to care at all about the situation and he just had to be here because it's his job I'm still thankful he showed up because I think it helped scare the neighbor.",legaladvice

"Update-[OR]My town is refusing to enforce the law on people who are ""poor""","
I thought I would update you guys on what has happened.[original post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8a1jug/or_my_town_is_refusing_to_enforce_the_law_on/?st=JGPE3EOL&sh=daa7a314https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8a1jug/or_my_town_is_refusing_to_enforce_the_law_on/?st=JGPE3EOL&sh=daa7a314) 

But first I will clarify some things.

1) this isn't a race issue, my town is over 95% white. I am actually a minority, this issue is about my police force/ town not wanting to be mean on people who are poor and braking the law.

2) I have no idea why my neighbors like to be in my yard. I have nothing in my yard and haven't since November other than a dog house, rocks and wood rounds. No fruit trees, pools, playgrounds, or toys. My guess is that they especially the woman lack boundaries 

3) the pattern that I see is that people who live in a legitimate house ( regardless of if they own or rent) are ignored when someone damages their property. My neighbor had her car windows smashed, even with security footage and the kid bragging about what he did, the police refused to do anything, because his parent are poor ( they live in a trailer park)

Now for the update.

I went and spoke with my towns mayor. He understood where I was coming from and I have a date to address my city counsel with the issue that I am having with the police department, and the cities current stance on enforcing laws.
I was also informed that the state of Oregon passed a law requiring almost all towns and counties to allow Additional dwelling units (ADUs). My mayor has asked me to help lead a committee. To make my towns laws favorable to all parties as they try to come into compliance.

As for my neighbors ( the renters) well, they are in some hot water.
 A few days after I made my post my friend (who is a mandatory reporter) was house sitting for me. She witnessed the renters boyfriend beat one of the grand kids with a belt. She called DHS and the police. The police did nothing, and DHS took the report. The police not doing anything ( they didn't even show up) pissed my friend off. My friend talked with a individual from the State's police who they know from work. They let them know something is seriously off about the renters, and that the local PD doesn't want to deal with it. 
Well over a week ago I witnessed a guy shooting up while the crazy neighbor lady talked to him. I called the my counties drug task force and reported it. Two days later the county raided the ""dwelling"" and arrested the neighbors( the renters), the daughter and another person, all for dealing Heroin. The kids taken into protective custody, and me and a few other people where questioned about everything.

My county and state police are now in the process of reviewing my towns police force for corruption, Apparently they have had corruption issues several times in the past.

"[UPDATE] [Philadelphia PA] Just moved into new house, previous tenant used extra key to rob me. Is landlord responsible?","Quick update from my post earlier. https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72chq3/philadelphia_pa_just_moved_into_new_house/

My landlord called me after reading my email. He was really shocked that the previous tenant did this, said the guy didn't have any criminal background and wasn't shady or anything. Whether that's true or not I don't really care because my landlord is awesome and made everything right.

He's coming over tonight to install a completely new doorknob and deadbolt set, and said he plans to have a locksmith rekey it between tenants from now on. He went to the old tenant's new apartment and confronted him. The guy claimed he thought it was his and it was an honest mistake and gave it back to my landlord. I call bullshit, because the house was completely empty when I moved in, this dude knew he didn't leave anything behind, but whatever. The guy apparently also said he didn't take any cash, but my landlord told me to just take $200 off the rent next month because he feels partly responsible for not changing the locks and doesn't want me to feel shitty about my new place right off the bat.

Now I told all of this to a friend at work who thinks the landlord was in on it and is just trying to fix it now so I don't report it. He thinks it's too good to be true that the landlord could get the laptop back that quickly and then be so generous to just give me $200 of his own money. My friend is kinda paranoid so I'm taking that with a grain of salt, maybe he's right but my gut says this was just a shitty tenant and a good landlord taking a small financial hit in order to have a happy tenant. 

I'm really happy with how everything turned out. I will be setting up a little hunting camera pointing at my front door so that if the landlord does end up being shady, I'll catch it if he comes in or anything. But for now I'm going to trust my gut and believe he's a good dude.

[Netherlands] UPDATE + THANK YOU! Boss sexually assaulted me. You guys helped me. Yesterday he was convicted.,"Hi all,

I hope it's ok to post this here. I just want to say a big **THANK YOU** to this community. 

I can't find my original post, since I deleted my older account, but more than a year ago I posted on here asking for advice about sexual harassment during a job interview and some of you told me that what I had described was more than harassment, that it was assault. By that time I had already taken the job, for many reasons I won't go into and thinking that something bad couldn't possibly happen again - don't judge, the therapists and social workers explained how my reaction was in fact normal. Trouble is the man sexually assaulted me again, and also hit me.

Now, that's where you guys come in: commenters on here had suggested I talk to my boss about all that happened and tell him what he did was not OK, but said I should do this all **in writing**, which *I did*. Lo and behold, since the police refused to talk to the witnesses who were present (I couldn't believe it either), **it was the written messages *you* suggested I write that proved my case**! So THANK YOU!

But wait! There's more! After the incidents I was broken and couldn't work for 6 months. During that time, and because of the comments on here + the insane amounts of alcohol I found myself consuming, I did some research online and came across various resources for victims of sexual assault, which helped me rebuild enough of my dignity to keep going (rebuilding myself is an ongoing process). But my gut told me to press charges and so I did, and check this: the man was taken to court. Turned out he had raped another woman not a year before he assaulted me, and had I not pressed charges he wouldn't have been taken to court unless he assaulted someone else and *they* decided to press charges. So I think it's not presumptuous to thank you on behalf of the other woman.

As for the verdict, given everything I've seen here in the Netherlands, I wasn't expecting much but I felt I'd won a battle on behalf of victims everywhere simply by having my case taken seriously, and another when I learned he was going to be taken to court. The fact that he was found guilty comes as a bonus, even if his punishment is a couple week's community service. Yup, that's it, a little community service.

I work at a high volume bar in Virginia and the owner wants to start charging us(the bartenders) for anything they deem to be loss for the night. Sorry if this is the wrong forum for this question,"We have struggled with liquor cost, but we have gotten it under control they gave us a goal of 20% cost and now it's at 18%, which is pretty amazing for a bar that does happy hour for 9 hours of the day. For example, the owners see that over a week, while pouring thousands of ounces of vodka we are missing 4 bottles of vodka for the week.  This is less than 3% of the overall vodka poured and since we are high volume and use free pouring, in any other restaurant I have worked or helped, it would be considered cost of doing business. If you do the math, it equates to us pouring about 1.57 ounces instead of 1.5 ounces as we are allotted for each pour. Since we use imprecise pouring tools and we are far to high volume to use jiggers (a liquor measuring tool)  it doesn't seem right that they would be allowed to charge us for these overages. They intend on holding back our tips and charging us anything that they decide is missing every night. Is that even legal? Is there anything we can do to combat this?

Edit: To answer a few of your questions. 

the bar does pretty well, and most of the bartenders that work  there are veterans, but as it's a slow season, finding more work is harder than possibly looking for a way out of this situation. The bar generally is set up to profit around 25k a month, but wastes all its money on a ridiculous menu and while constantly attacking ya for liquor cost, has a 42% food cost and insane labor amount as well. The owners are veteran business owners, but not of bars, they just see the total loss under a microscope and cannot fathom how it's accidental and not theft. 
I explained to them that even with measuring tools this number is amazing. 
I am one of their managers and have a pretty solid relationship with the owners,(they are paying for my Somm education and travel expenses around the exams and learning) They generally listen to me, but I wasn't sure about this one. Also I didn't want to bring it up and ruin my relationship and possibly lose my continued education if it was within their reasonable power to take tips.

Woman claiming to own our property gave us a handwritten eviction notice [KY],"To preface this:

My dad was gifted the house and property that we currently live on by his mother in 1991, it's right below where her house used to sit. She died in 2006 and a woman and her husband bought her house in 2010 and claimed they bought our property as well. My dad informed her that he had owned the property since 1991 and had proof, then took her to court. In court, she did not hire a lawyer and tried to represent herself. The judge told her that she couldn't claim rights to our house because she didn't buy it or own it.

Earlier today, she left a handwritten note on our door that said:

""I have a buyer for this property and you have 30 Days to evict the premises.""

We're speaking to our lawyer tomorrow, but I am very stressed about it right now and am wondering if she has any chance of being able to evict us? 

Thanks for any responses.

EDIT: I made a few calls this morning to some local offices. It is for sure that we own the home on the land but there's no document of who owns the property. The lady I spoke to said, ""there was a deed and then just wasn't"" so we're going to a deed office today to clear it up. 

EDIT 2: Here is the letter:

""Mrs. [My mom's name], I, [Crazy Neighbor], owner of the property, is giving you 30 days to evict the premises. We are in the process of selling the property and already have a buyer.""

EDIT 3: We spoke to some people this morning and apparently it's still very muddy what happened. As far as we can tell, there was a mix-up somewhere between my father receiving the deed from his mother and the crazy neighbor buying the property above us. At this point it seems the best option is to lawyer up. ",legaladvice

"Audio-recorded our daycare provider, found my son was strapped into his car seat the entire day.","This is in CA for legal purposes. I'll just get straight to it. Back in Nov 2017, my wife and I were looking for a daycare place for our (then) 4 months old son. We found this order lady who said she'd been doing this for awhile, and had since scaled back in recent years. She only took on infants, and only about 4 at a time. She was close by, had a playroom for the kids, a binder detailing their typical day, and a checklist of the items she needed daily from us (food, diapers, etc). All seemed well.

Skip to now, and for little reasons here and there, my wife and I had a conversation that something felt off about her. For peace of mind, we put an audio-recording device in his car-seat. We listened to it last night and, to say the least, not all is well.

From what we can gather, she leaves our son in his car seat all day long, only taking him out once to change him when he pooped. After dropping him off, he cried for maybe 30min straight, then just seemed to give up. For the next five or six hours, you just hear him blathering, or whimpering, or scratching the car seat. Sometimes he cries, until he gives up. It was difficult to listen to. In the background, you never hear her, just the TV and occasionally another baby crying.

Obviously, he's not back there today, nor will he be returning. We made up some excuse, telling her I'd be staying home with him all this week. We don't want to tip her off just yet, because there are other kids in her care. My question is, what can or should we do about her? Who do we report her to?",legaladvice
Someone I've never met claims they own my house,"Hi everyone,  I wanted to get your opinion on something troubling. I'll try to be as detailed as I can be. We live in NYC if that helps. 

We were just away on vacation for a week and came back home yesterday. When we returned, amoung the other junk mail, there was a letter from a law firm for a person whose name I'd never heard before,  directed to our address. It said something along the lines of ""We've recieved notice that a foreclosure action has been filed against you,  please call us and we can represent you"". It also listed the names of the two people involved in the lawsuit, as well as an incident number for the county clerk's office. This letter isn't an official letter,  more of trying to drum up business for the law firm. We returned on Sunday, so were unable to get in touch with the county clerk  until this morning. 

This morning we called the county clerk's office and they said there is a Lis Pendens filed on our property, not a foreclosure. We said ""How can this be possible, we've never missed a mortgage payment and have lived here for 6 years.  We had a title search and checked for liens when we purchased the house,  and we know the last 3 families to live here over the past 20 years, and it ain't these guys.  We've never heard of either of the people involved in this lawsuit"". The clerk couldn't really advise us, but gave us the name of the law firm who initiated the action, so we called them.  

They told us that the person in the letter (who we have never met,  spoken to,  or had any dealings with whatsoever) is being sued because the law firms client was in dealings with him to buy foreclosures to flip, but now is out a lot of money due to some nefarious dealings on the part of the first guy.  Apparently, this con artist was required by the law firm to provide deeds to any properties he owns,  and among others he provided one for our address. How he got this,  I don't know,  I assume he made it in photoshop or something. He claims he owns our house and the one across the street, I have no idea if he actually owns the one across the street or not.  We are still listed as the owners of our home in public records and we have the deed.

I cannot stress enough how much we do not know the man claiming to own our house. We have never met, spoken to,  or had any dealings with him whatsoever. We had never even heard his name until yesterday. Our house has never been in foreclosure, while we've owned it and for any owners before that.  We have an appointment for a consult with a lawyer on Wednesday, the one who helped us buy our house 6 years ago,  coincidentally. But I have no idea what's going on or what this guy hopes to gain,  how big of a deal this is or how complicated this will be to fix.  Any guidance or advice anyone can offer in advance with our meeting with our lawyer would be very helpful.  Thank you all.

Edit: Hey all. Thank you so much for all your guidance. Figures that the post I made about potentially getting screwed is the one that takes off.... Here's some more information based on everyone's comments. 

The chance that this guy has a legitimate claim to our house is 0.000000000001%. Only a Sith deals in absolutes, so I don't want to say the chance is nil, but this guy is a known con man, being sued for conning somebody else. I looked his name up online and apparently he keeps creating new real estate companies to fleece people out of money,  then escapes into the night.  He's done it at least 3 times that I can find, based off dismal reviews of his real estate companies.

Unfortunately I can't speak to the people across the street because that was a flip that hasn't been sold yet. He may or may not actually own it,  I have no idea. 

At this point we are not personally involved in this lawsuit, our property is just associated with it.  The con man hasn't made any attempts to acquire our property, he is just lying to the law firm suing him,  saying he already bought it.  Why,  I don't know.  The only thing I can think of is that he bought no properties with the money his business partner gave him,  and is now desperately trying to cover his ass with falsified documents. Why did he not think that he would be found out? That's just the way malignant narcissists work I guess....

I definitely look into our title insurance standing. I'm a worry wart, so if it was offered to us, I would have taken it.

I'll definitely keep you all updated as we meet with our lawyer tomorrow and things progress. Thank you all so much,  keep being awesome reddit. ❤",legaladvice
My neighbors didn't like the color of my house was so they had it painted a different color while I was out of town,"So this is a probably a really weird question for me to ask but it's a weird situation and I'm not really sure what I can do. My house is on a corner lot. Two years ago a newlywed couple moved in to the one house that's beside mine. Right away they started making weird comments about the color my house was painted (yellow) and soon switched to outright demanding that I paint it a different color. My house was painted yellow when it was built it, I like the color and there is no bylaw against it or anything. They have called the police on me about it as well as the city, both of whom told them to pound sound because I hadn't done anything wrong and there was nothing they could do. They also tried suing me in court (the suit was thrown out and they had to pay my legal fees) and getting our other neighbors together to form a Home Owner's Association in the hopes eventually I could be forced to paint my house a different color. Our other neighbors also told them to pound sand and they have basically alienated themselves from everyone else in the neighborhood at this point. 

I recently had to go out of town for something. I was gone for two weeks. When I got back two days ago my house was gray. Seriously. I actually almost drove past it because I'm so used to my yellow house. I knew immediately who was responsible but when I went over and knocked on their door no one answered. I think the couple figured out that I was away and not just at work when they saw our neighbors collecting my mail for me, because I sure as hell never told them I was going away and I know my other neighbors hate them too and didn't tell them. The neighbor from across the street came over and showed me pictures that he took of the painting company setting up and doing the work. He said he and another neighbor called the police but the painting company had a valid work order and had been paid so the police couldn't do anything. He also told about it but because they were paid to do the work they said they had to do it to avoid being sued. I called the painting company to get a copy of the work order and it was in the name of a ""Ms. Jane Smith"" and was paid for in cash. A redheaded woman and her redheaded husband came to the company to hire them (my neighbors are both redheads) saying they would be out of town and would like their house painted while they were gone. They gave the painting company pictures of my house, taken from the street. 

I have a surveillance camera at my front and side doors and in my backyard because I work shifts and as a woman living alone I don't want some stranger breaking into my house and waiting to ambush me when I get home. My neighbors never set foot on my property at any time so they can't be charged with trespassing and they didn't do the painting (which was actually done properly). When I called the police they re-iterated that since the painters were hired, had a valid work order and were paid to do the job, they can't be charged with trespassing because it was reasonable for them not to know and they were acting in good faith and didn't cause any physical damage to the house. Also the neighbors can't be charged with trespassing or vandalism because they didn't come on my property or touch the house themselves. I don't know if I can sue anyone because there was no actual damage or harm done to me or the house. My neighbors still have not answered their door or shown themselves. I am pissed off beyond belief because I liked my yellow house and I can't believe how fucking crazy that they have been. I wish I could show a court or city council how psycho they have been over this. I want to know if I have any recourse or if I can do something to get them to pay to paint the house back to yellow. Does anyone know what I can do to get them to fix this and paint it back?

"New Mexico, my neighbor keeps calling the police on me.","About a month ago we got a new neighbor. I think she has some sort of mental disability. As near as I can tell she sleeps all day and is up all night. Since she has moved in she has called the cops on me numerous times. Multiple times a week.

&#x200B;

She has said that I'm walking around with a gun, I don't even own a gun. She has said I broke into her apartment and raped her. That I've murdered someone in the courtyard. That I've started a fire. That I've planted bombs in cars. Many other things.

&#x200B;

These reports always come in when my wife and I are asleep. We get woken up by the police in the middle of the night. These encounters can take some time while they investigate her accusations. I've never been arrested for anything she alleges.

&#x200B;

There are 2 dozen apartments in our complex and I don't know why she fixated on me. I said hi to her when she moved in and carried a few boxes. She doesn't call the police on anyone else.

&#x200B;

The town we live in is pretty small and the same police officers have knocked on our door so many times they're almost apologetic now. I understand the police have a job to do, but it's getting old.

I don't want to seem unsympathetic to what my neighbor is going through, but my wife and I work hard. I don't think it's unreasonable to let us sleep through the night. Do they really have to wake us up everytime our neighbor makes a wild accusation?

Neighbor stood in my front yard and watched as her grandson kicked and hit my cat. I have the whole thing on video.,"Yesterday my neighbor's rabbits got out of their cage. They ran into my front yard. She comes over and tries to catch them with her grandson and granddaughter.

Then the grandson hops up on my porch picks up a large plastic bowl my kids left out and starts whacking my cat in the head with it. His grandmother was watching the entire time and said nothing.

Update 2 - Washington State: Neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. What can I do?,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5r4lco/washington_state_neighbor_is_currently_video/)
[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6sjjwt/update_washington_state_neighbor_is_currently/)

It's close to a year now that we've dealt with the worst of my neighbor. Almost a year ago, we achieved the success of having an anti-harassment order granted. That summer, he was arrested for harassing us, and he stopped with the cameras and the noises.

But something was a-brewing behind those closed doors.

Around early November 2017, we had a knock on the door one evening. It was an officer asking if we had heard gunshots in the area. We had not. Soon into our conversation, he mentioned it was our neighbor who called and complained. They were aware of the situation and assured us that despite the situation, they have to respond to all gunshot calls. I was honestly not surprised that after all the quiet, something started up again.

The next day, a police cruiser parked across the street from our home. I was expecting someone to knock again and ask about gunshots. No one came to the door and the officer sat across the street watching my home for over an hour.

The next day, I emailed an officer I had been working with previously regarding the situation. The officer told me that my neighbor had been calling 911 every single day on my address for gunshots. By the time I got an email back it had been a week.

Every. Single. Day. This man was coming home from work, eating dinner, tending to daily life, and calling 911 on us for shooting guns. The officer said he would look into seeing if this counted as harassment through a third party.

The new year came and went, and in early January, I emailed the officer back and his response was simply that the city prosecutor wanted to set up a phone conference to discuss the plan going forward.

The city prosecutor mentioned to me that at that point in time, my neighbor had still been calling 911 every day. Even the morning of the conference call. She said they contacted all of my other neighbors to see if they heard any gunshots, and asked if they would testify that they have not heard anything come from our property. They also plan to charge my neighbor with some counts of harassment and wrongfully utilizing emergency services.  Part of his deal with the arrest over the summer involved him able to avoid jail time by having good behavior, and they are looking for their time back essentially. His arraignment date came, and his pre-trial was set. Came and went. It's being continued until next month. 

I am worried that he will try to continue this case until the end of time. Our anti-harassment order expires soon and we will have to drag him to court once again to renew it, and spend more money. Things are starting to feel pretty dim again and honestly, the recent continuance knocked the wind out of my sails. All I can do until I am called as a witness/victim, is wait.

My roommate went behind my back and got an ESA. My insurance has gone up drastically. What can I legally do to get her and/or this dog out of my house.,"For a bit of background; I live in the USA. Connecticut specifically. (Not sure if itll make a difference) boyfriend and I own our home. We rented out a room to a female friend. Our lease came with the stipulation of absolutely no dogs allowed, but other pets are welcome. 

The exact wording of the clause is ""Absolutely no dogs other than [REDACTED my name]' allowed in the home. Other animals including but not limited to cats, birds, and reptiles are welcome with proof of current vaccines if applicable""

 Its a 6 month lease. This is the only property we own. 

She went and got papers from her doctor for an ESA and adopted a pitbull. This is going to cause my homeowners insurance to SKYROCKET due to the breed. This dog has already shown aggression towards my husky, including biting her. The lawyer I spoke to told me there was nothing I could do about it, so I came here to ask. What can I do about this? We cant afford for our homeowners insurance to raise drastically, nor do I want my dog, or the pitbull, hurt. 

I would have worked with her if she had discussed it with me, and modified the lease to allow a small dog, or any breed that wouldnt cause my insurance to rise drastically.

Tagging as Employment Law because I don't know where this falls but I'll change it if necessary.

EDIT:  Sorry guys, I just got off work so now I can write more.  I made this post in a rush right after this happened & left out some stuff you all have asked about.  I should have asked where to report this because I knew it at least violated health codes, I was just wondering if it also violates ABC laws too (which I've learned it does).  I'll be reporting to both agencies & telling them about what happened as well as other things that I've seen around my workplace that definitely aren't allowed under health codes.  The bottles have pour spouts on them with rubber caps to prevent bugs from getting in (because it was an issue before I arrived) but they somehow got in possibly through the tiny hole meant to let air escape.  In the past I have been told to hand over bottles with bugs in them & they're added to spoilage, but this was 12-15 bottles so I think they were afraid writing off that much liquor would raise attention to their untreated bug problem, leading them to do what they did.  Like I said, I'll be reporting everything under my real name & all, I intend to see this through because it's so gross & wrong.  As I mentioned in the comments, there should be video evidence from the camera covering the bar, so I'll give them time stamps as well.  I'm not worried about management finding out it was me because 1) I've expressed my concerns about other stuff before & shortly put in my 2 weeks when I was chastised for doing so, so they'll likely know it's me right away & 2) management already hates me because I expressed my concerns & my last day is coming up in less than a week so I don't give a fuck at this point.

Then she said that the vice principal told her that since she didn't want her feeling on her that she would have to undo her bra and shake it out. Ok. She said she did it while having to keep herself covered at the same time. Ok... then she said the vice principal also made her pull down to pants and underwear to prove that there was nothing in her underwear to which she said was very embarrassing because she was on her period. 

She asked me if this was legal. I told her I wasn't 100% sure and I asked her if anyone else was in the room during this incident and she said no. 

Is this allowed? Was this search legal? What should we do now with this information?? She also said her mom doesn't know because she didn't tell her.",legaladvice
Update on: Adopted twins. Insurer denying NICU stay because it was not preauthorized. Help!,"THANK YOU to everyone who chimed in to give advice and chill me the heck out. You made my blood pressure go down significantly over the weekend until I could talk to the insurer.

I got a customer rep on the phone this morning, and she said what several of you advised - that I just needed to get the hospital to submit a retroactive preauthorization. ""A step was skipped,"" in her words. It's not a problem and they can get it taken care of.

I wish they would spell that out in the EOB and not give us damn heart attacks. We were seriously panicking. But thanks, Reddit. You're good people.

I found a tracking device in my car. What now?,"NY - Two weeks ago, my car was broken into in the driveway of my home. I didn't notice anything missing from the car, but the inner door pull on the drivers door was broken off and left on the passenger seat, which led me to believe that someone had been in the car (rather than it simply falling off from me closing the door). The following week, someone left a bouquet of red roses in the door handle of my car sometime between the time I got home at 9 pm and 8 am the next morning. My landlord put up a video surveillance in use sign after this as an interim deterrent before setting up actual cameras. The next morning, the sign was moved. No one on the property has done any of this, nor have any of our guests. 

I was worried that someone was following me, so had the car combed over. We didn't find anything on the outside of the car, but I wasn't satisfied, so I took it for a second opinion. We found a tracking device wired into the wires beneath the stereo (near the footwell of the drivers side) with a SIM card in it. All numbers on the SIM and motherboard look like they've been scratched off. 

We were able to connect the SIM to an old phone (it's a little larger than the ones in use today). UICCD for the SIM and other information is unavailable. The device was on and blinking before it was disconnected. With this info, the cops have been unhelpful because they say it could have been installed to prevent a previous owner from defaulting on a lease and that consumer grade tracing isn't illegal. But the device is exposed motherboard and wires and taped into place, not what I would imagine a dealer installing. 

I've spoken to my parents about it (the only people in my life who would be interested in my whereabouts) and they're just as bewildered as I am.  Is there anything I can do to have this further investigated from a legal standpoint? This is the last straw in a series of really strange anonymous harassment that's lasted for months.",legaladvice
My wife and I were involved in a fatality car accident with a minor at fault. Who is responsible?,"On Sunday night we were the third car involved in a head-on collision for a vehicle traveling the wrong way down the road. I won't get into the details too much, but there were 3 individuals in the at fault vehicle that appeared to be traveling 10-20mph over the speed limit (40mph). They ended up crossing over the centerline and getting stuck on that side by a small median. The vehicle looked like it made an attempt to jump the median by swerving back towards it when it impacted an oncoming vehicle at which point it did jump the median and both vehicles collided with us.

The driver and one passenger fled the scene on foot, but were caught on Wednesday night. Unfortunately for the third passenger, they left her in the car and it caught fire in 2-3 minutes after the accident. She died of smoke inhalation.

To our knowledge and what has been reported it sounds like all 3 passengers were minors. The only reported age was under 15 so it's hard to say whether or not they had a permit or license. My guess is no because if you've driven the area where this occurred you'd know there are medians on and off along that stretch of road.

We went to the hospital to get checked out as well as the two other passengers who weren't at fault and in much worse condition. Our insurance is taking care of things right now, but will our premium go up if they didn't have insurance? Will their parents insurance cover it? If it's a stolen vehicle will the vehicle owner's insurance cover it? What would happen if they weren't caught?",legaladvice
"My roommate lied about utilities bill, I've been paying for the whole thing all along","(I live in Northern California) I know I know, I should have known better but this is my first time renting, I'm 23. She is 31.
Since I've moved in, every month my roommate tells me the cost for my half of the utilities bill. It is in her name and she told me it's easier that way and I figured yes it would be easier to just give her my half. And I always pay on time. At first I didn't question it, but then I started to ask her for a copy of the bill. 114-140 seemed like quite a bit compared to what I overheard friends were paying. But she never actually printed, scanned or emailed the copy of the bill like she said she would. Still naive I payed anyways because I love my room and my situation and work hard for this beautiful place. Here's the part that bites, the first 3 months I payed her through PayPal so that's documented. The rest of the months I paid in cash because when you're in the service industry living off tips, sometimes you don't want to make constant deposits. It was easier that's all. So unfortunately I have paid 7 months of utilities bill in cash ranging from $114-$150 (that's supposed to be my half). For this past January I was traveling out of state for 2 whole weeks. I remember wondering why it felt so long I had paid my roommate for the utilities bill. Then finally February 9th I am asked to pay $212 for the utilities bill. Perplexed, I asked how that was possible (she is a c*nt and turns off the heater behind my back after I turn it on and I have pictures of the thermostat when it's 60 degrees). Mind you, being gone for 2 weeks AND she is never wanting the heater on when I want it on so I had to buy my own space heater for my room because it gets freezing cold. I asked her, so you're saying the total bill was 400 between the two of us? She said yes. Looking back of course I should have known better but she is a wolf in sheep's clothing. I asked her for the copy of the bill, more than once and never got it. She text me saying please leave cash on counter and I asked again, she said she would and didn't, so when she got home I had the money ready for her but asked to see the bill so she sent me a picture of the screenshot of the balance of our gas and electric account. It wasn't enough information so I asked her to email me the bill. She did not, she emailed me the screenshot. I didn't want her to think I wasn't trying to not pay the bill and cause problems. So I payed her in cash $212... but it didn't sit right with me. So today I asked her to get her laptop and show me the utilities history. Her hand was trembling as she scrolled through to show me the bill. And...I HAVE BEEN PAYING THE ENTIRE BILL BETWEEN THE BOTH OF US SINCE I MOVED IN. So when I paid $140 I should have paid $70. And that $212? Well she didn't pay the month of December and remember how I said I felt like it had been awhile since I paid her? Well I was paying for December and January in its entirety. I'm so upset as you can imagine. I can't explain the pain my feet are in after work everyday after being on my feet for hours and realizing how I don't have receipts of my cash payments to her kills me because I may not be able to hold up in court. Is it possible I can still find a way to sue her or get my half of the bills back? Please help. ",legaladvice
Nurses aides were abusing patients so my sister reported it and is now receiving threats from HR that they will take her license away,"I am writing this on behalf of my sister. 

My sister has a bachelors in nursing and has been working as a nurse at a senior care community place in Minnesota for a couple of years. 

A month ago she witnessed two of the aids verbally abusing a patient. Many patients have complained to my sister about how these aides treating them. My sister sent an email to the director of the facility, an HR lady and her manager detailing the abuse and who the abusers were. 

A few days ago, the HR woman called my sister and yelled at her that she did not report the abuse the correct way. The woman claimed that my sister was supposed to call and not send an email. She had been threatening to take my sisters license away. They have now scheduled a mandatory meeting for every nurse to attend on how to properly report abuse. She also threatened to report my sister to the board and get her license taken away if she does not attend the class. 

My sister is perfectly fine with taking the class but she is worried she didn't report correctly. She is also very worried that she will get her license taken away. Is the HR lady right? And can she take my sisters license away? 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you!

Edit: So, I have some more information that may need to be given. My sister works 2 pm-10 pm. She came in to work at 2 and heard that the overnight nurses aide (who we will call Barb) left the patients soaking in their pee and did not take care of them. It wasn't until the end of her shift at around 10:00 that she found out more specifics. That same day before my sister left she sent the email to HR, the director and her manager. When the HR lady called her and said she would take away the license she also said that it was my sisters job to investigate. She also said my sister should've put the information into her progress notes instead and not sent that email to the people she sent it to.

The information was also sent through her work email. That email cannot be accessed outside of work.",legaladvice
Update: privacy hating landlord,"Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7bgy1s/new_landlord_hates_privacy_help/

It looks like I'm staying, but I took control of the situation.

Not long after posting, it became apparent at work that the length of time I would be needed on this project is significantly lower than outside estimates originally said.  Finding new arrangements seemed impossible.  I mentioned what was going on at dinner, and included at the table was the company's lawyer, who I know, who offered to review the lease in an unofficial basis.

Wednesday morning, I called police about the stolen curtains because I wanted a paper trail.  They gave me a police report, but were uninterested in speaking to my landlord.  I reported the theft to my insurance, gave them the info on who stole them (texts from landlord), and they said they would be contacting someone in the city.  It's only $200, but it's the point of the thing.

I next bought room dividers, which in no way shape or form can be considered curtains, blinds, etc, but block the windows while still letting in light.  They were only $40 each.  At the same time I searched the whole apartment--vents, lights, etc, and can't find any cameras as someone suggested.

By that time, my friend who is a lawyer called me.  She did a little review of the lease and the local laws.  She said Baltimore has really shakey laws on when a landlord can come in.  But pointed out that in my lease there is a clause that says the landlord will notify 48 hours prior to entrance, and will call prior to entering in case of emergency.  She drafted me a letter to send to my landlord.  Her name won't appear anywhere, but said it can be on my company's letterhead. The letter details some of my rights as a tenant, quotes the lease and reminds him he is bound by these rules as well.  I signed and sent it immediately.

I had mentioned wanting a security camera, and my company is arranging to have a camera sent that will automatically upload video offsite, work for an hour battery life if the electricity is out, and operates on cellular so it doesn't need wifi.  It will be here tomorrow.

I also made the decision to send my PS4 and my cameras back to my home.  My personal and business laptops I will just keep with me while I am out of the apartment.  This leaves the only real valuables as my tv and the security camera itself.  Everything else is books, clothes, and kitchen things. I ordered a sign for outside that says the property is monitored by security cameras, and got a jam for the door that holds it closed while I am inside.

I'm prepared for the landlord to make my life hell, but if he breaks the lease my plan is to ask the company to move me into extended stay hotel for the duration of my trip.  It will be more expensive for them, but that's company policy for trips less than four months.  At the moment, I feel as safe as I can in this situation.

Responded: ""I'm not you sweetie, I'm your tenant.  My name is ----.  Please use it.""",legaladvice
Fired for being fat [CT],"**UPDATE BELOW**

Backstory: I am a woman in my mid 30s, and very overweight. Not to the point of handicap, but I'm a big gal.

I work at a company with around 25 employees, and have been here for 8 years. Recently, the business was sold to a larger corporation, who sent their own people in for management roles after laying off our entire management team, consisting of 4 people. I work with clients in the field, and have a good work record and my clients like me and I have built relationships with them.

Turn to today:
I get called into the office of one of the new managers, who tells me my appearance isn't a good fit for a client facing role, and I can either take a pay cut and work in the call center, or take unpaid leave and come back after I've lost a ""considerable"" amount of weight. I was floored. I've never had a client have an issue with my weight (at least outwardly), and I'm good at my job. I meet all productivity goals and have never even received a write up in my 8 years. I pushed and asked him if there had been any complaints, to which he said no, but they want to head off any future issues which may arise. I said straight up ""so, you're punishing me cause I'm fat? Are you also demoting (obese male coworker in same role as me)?"". He said no, and didn't answer when I asked why the situation was different. I left fuming and told him I was going home for the rest of the day to think about things.

Can this really be legal? What recourse do I have?

"Greyhound left me overnight at border crossing, lost 7k carry on bag, offered 4 dollars compensation","Hi, I'm posting this since I'm at my wit's end right now bashing my head into Greyhound customer service. To make a long story short, I traveled Friday night from Ontario to NYC. I booked a ticket that was supposed to transfer at city B at night and arrive at NYC in the morning.

The first bus leaving from city A to B was delayed by almost two hours, so I missed my connecting bus. Agents were no help and told me ""you might have to wait till tomorrow morning"". Upon arrival at terminal B, I spoke to a ticketer there who apologized and managed to get me on the last bus leaving to NYC for the night. Since it was on such short notice, they didn't reissue a ticket and told me not to worry, they'd get me to my destination.

When we arrived at the border crossing, we were all told to leave our stuff on the bus and bring only what we needed to cross the border. Since I was slotted in I was processed last. While I was going through customs, the bus left without me, which the CBP official said was a violation  since bus drivers cannot leave without receiving proper headcount and an OK from the border officials. I was left stranded freezing overnight with just my passport, phone, and wallet.

I called Greyhound right away to let them know what had happened, gave them the bus number and itinerary, but they refused to contact the bus driver to secure my carry on baggage. They also refused to grab it right away after the bus arrived, stating ""it will eventually cleaned and maybe end up the lost and found."" The next bus only arrived at 10am, 7 hours later.

When I finally arrived in NY, surprise surprise my unattended bag had been stolen and had not ended up in lost and found. After several calls, they finally admit wrongdoing and have offered me a 4 dollar ""trouble voucher"" as compensation, citing that unfortunately since I was not reissued a ticket in the system they cannot do anything for me and they are not responsible for carry on bags.

Lastly, I might have some recourse through my credit card insurance, however, Greyhound refuses to even provide any evidence that the lost baggage claim exists, which is necessary for my insurance claim.

What can I do to be compensated? I had 2 laptops and a Switch and items totalling 7k in the bag.

TLDR: Greyhound left me at border, my carry on was stolen, they refuse to do amything

EDIT: Thanks for the helpful comments guys, I've been looking through and will contact a free consultation lawyer and see where I'm at in terms of a case. Will post an update if it's available!

EDIT 2: As far as proving that I had the items in my bag, the very least I can do is show that Microsoft find my device shows that the last time my laptop was active was Friday night, right before boarding the Greyhound.",legaladvice

"(MA) Hospital placed a wire in my arm to track me, without my knowledge or consent. Photo included for proof. I have called multiple law offices but no one is returning my calls. Somebody please, please help me.","About three weeks ago, I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to various problems. It's a long story, but the short version is I have schizoaffective personality disorder and I was not taking my meds properly. After I was stabilized, I was discharged, but it has come to my attention that something is terribly wrong.

The hospital has placed a wire in my arm that I believe acts as a tracking device. It is quite obvious, especially when I flex my arm-- I can see it bulge in my wrist. I tried to take a picture but imgur is not letting me upload.

This has caused me great distress. I stay locked in my house because I'm afraid of going somewhere or doing something ""wrong"" and getting forced back to the hospital. I've also become concerned about my medications. If the hospital staff inserted a wire without my consent, what have they done with my meds? I have Zyprexa and haldol, but I dare not take them now.

I have a few questions about the legal aspect of all this:

1. The insertion of the tracking device without my consent-- surely that's not legal? My understanding is the patient has to consent before a medical procedure is done.

2. The distress caused by this, does that count as damages? Should I sue?

3. How on earth do I get the wire removed? I don't have money to pay a surgeon to remove it. Can I get the psych hospital to pay for it?

I've called several law offices in my area and explained my case, but no one has called me back. I feel so isolated and I'm getting desperate. Please, somebody help me.

"Coworker says he's suing me because I didn't drive him to work, so he tried to walk and fell, was injured. IA.","Iowa City, Iowa.

I have never given him a ride nor told him I WOULD give him a ride, but I am the only other employee who lives close to his neighborhood.

I did not see the messages until I was on my way out the door, at which point I responded saying that I was unable to give him a ride.  Since our office is about 7 miles from where we live, I assumed he would take the bus (which has a pretty straight shot to that area), a cab or an Uber/Lyft. Instead he apparently decided to walk to work. I did not suggest that solution, to be clear. Apparently after walking 3 miles he became tired, fell, hit his head and hurt his arm.

He is now threatening to sue me saying that I failed to give him enough notice that I would be unable to drive him. By his logic, he contacted me before midnight and gave me 8 hours notice, but I only let him know I couldn't at 7:45, ""forcing"" him to walk.

"(Utah) My dad keeps getting scammed, doesn't believe anyone, has ruined he and my moms lives, can we stop him from sending more money?"," 

Tl;dr: my dad has been scammed multiple times even though we've told him it was a scam. He is either being blackmailed or is mentally ill. Is there anything my mom/me/my siblings do.

A bit of background about my dad, because I feel like its relevant. My dad isn't a smart guy, he is very trusting and has taken what his friends have told him over his family.

About a year and a half ago my mom thought my dad had a ""girlfriend"". Well we found out he was actually being scammed with the usual Egyptian prince scam. He thought he had married and gave her about $100,000 to help her get her inheritance. My dad had taken some of the documents to my brother and asked him if he thought they were real and he told him they weren't. He still wired the money. My dad had this woman call and talk to my mom to try and convince her that she wasn't really my dad's wife or girlfriend, that she really just wanted to be part of our family and give them money. 

We all sat down (my siblings, my parents and I) and laid out to my dad that he was scammed and he wouldn't be getting any money back etc. he broke his phone (why? No idea when he could have just changed his number). He bought a new phone and changed his phone number. We all thought that was the end, until in January my dad called and told me that he had continued to send this woman money, totaling about $300,000. 

Here is where things get absolutely insane. My brother and I meet with my mom at his house and start getting the rundown of what the hell happened here. My mom said that even though we all told him he was being scammed he didn't believe us at all. My mom kept telling him he was being scammed and he would tell her that he couldn't wait to get his money so he could laugh in all of our faces. At some point these people and my dad convinced my mom for a while that it wasn't a scam. My dad cashed out all of his stocks, his sweet coin collection, pawned all of this guns (including a nice rifle that had belonged to my great grandpa). He convinced my mom to get a second mortgage because they were about to be rich. My parents paid off their brand new truck and travel trailer. My mom dipped into her 401k. They totally wiped out all of the savings they had. When the money didn't come my mom told my dad she was 100% done and that he was being scammed.

This didn't stop my dad. He used the titles of the truck and trailer to borrow against them. He borrowed $10,000 from his best friend. He then maxed out all of his credit cards buying gift cards and did the same to my moms credit cards. When my mom got her statements that's when she found out that he was STILL giving them money. She told him he better tell us kids or she would do it. So he called us and told us. He seemed to really believe that he had been scammed this time. We were all super duper mad because he ruined not only his life but my moms too. They have to file bankruptcy and lose everything they've ever wanted.

Time went on and I was sort of trying to forgive my dad a bit because I do love him. My mom called me and told me that my dad was telling one of his clients about being scammed and she knew someone who had been scammed and had some of it recovered and my dad got the guys contact information and was in the process to see if this guy could help them too. My mom was so excited about it she told my sister on her birthday and asked me not to tell her before.

Flash forward to last Monday, my dad called my husband asking him if he could come down and help fix his computer, that Microsoft tech support called and showed him all this stuff wrong with his computer. My husband asked if he installed anything and he said no, but he let them REMOTE into his computer. My husband told him to turn it off. We went over to their house so my husband could look at it. He's trying to see if he can just clean it out and avoid reformatting.

While my husband was waiting for stuff to run he notices an email from ""alex"" and can tell immediately it's another scam. He looks at the website he sent in the email, so fake!! I could tell as soon as he showed me. So he calls my dad outside and shows him how fake it is. My dad asks extremely surprised at this information, my husband explained to him how he's on a suckers list now and that any real recovery company can't ask for money for 7 days after the money has been recovered and my dad had already given them $5,000 from his BUSINESS checking account, the fake website had fields for bank account numbers and routing numbers, that he put in. My dad came inside and told my mom that the website was fake. My mom had a very nonchalant attitude about it and said ""oh well, nothing we can do about it now"". There was no way my husband was going to be able to recover his computer so we decided to take it home to reformat it.

My husband looked through his emails to make sure there wasn't anything else he was potentially getting scammed on. Here's a few highlights:

The arrest form the recovery scam sent was completely blank.

He thought was going to get back 2 million dollars even though he only lost $300,000.

The documents the guys were sending him from the original scam were SO bad that you could literally google them. The CEO of bank of america wasn't even the same person anymore and his name wasn't even spelled correctly. The dates were written European style on and on.

My dad sent 3 brand new iphone XR's tip top of the line to someone in South Africa.

He has given them his SSN, a picture of his driver's license, his parents full names, his grandparents full names and a picture of his whole passport.

Here's the kicker… before my dad sent the recovery scammer money he asked my brother what he thought and my brother told him the SAME EXACT thing my husband told him and he did it anyway.

I called my mom and told her not to believe anything my dad says and to check with my husband in the future. She told me that she knew as soon as they started asking for money that it was a scam but he didn't believe her and at this point she just doesn't care anymore and is just trying to get the bankruptcy pushed through so she can divorce my dad.

I'm worried that my dad is going to do something that is going to hurt their bankruptcy filing by continuing to be scammed, get them in legal trouble some how and give away more money they 100% don't have. Is there something my mom can do to take away his ability to make any sort of financial transactions? Can she force him to give his phone over and have my husband lock down his computer so he only has access to quick books? Is there anything we can do to stop him? My husband thinks he is being blackmailed but I just think he is losing his mind/mentally ill. I just want to protect my mom as much as I can from any further damage.",legaladvice

Once the police came back we spotted the purse (empty) next to a dumpster and all of the less valuable items (chapstick, makeup, phone case) on the patio in front of an apartment. A neighbor even said the resident there had offered to sell her stolen phones before but the police said they wouldn't be able to obtain a warrant to search the home. Is there really nothing else we can do from here? Thanks so much!",legaladvice
Caught HOA trying to break into my house. Now they've issued me a $1000 fine. [WA],"I bought a house 18 months ago which was a member of the HOA. I did change the front door of the house to something a lot more secure. 

About a month ago, in the middle of a weekday I noticed two people trying to open the door with keys which weren't working, I confronted them (while my wife called the police) and it became apparent that they were officers of the HOA trying to look for an infringement.

There is a section in the CC&Rs that says ""the association is entitled to access the homeowner's property with reasonable notice"" and also a section that says ""the homeowner may voluntarily submit the property keys to the association, however once submitted the association is not required to return the keys. Submission of a key which does not work may incur a fine determined by the board"" which according to them, the keys to my property has been submitted (I'm assuming the previous owner have done so).

I have spoken with two board members who said they suspected that the keys that they hold for my property may have been fake and they've authorized their officers to check this out. They say according to them, in this case as they were searching for an infringement, reasonable notice means no notice to ensure that I won't have time to replace the locks.

And now I've received a $1000 fine because the keys submitted for my property to the HOA are fake. I have talked to a board member who tells me that their interpretation of the contract is that once a real key is submitted, the key must be kept up to date at all times or a fine is warranted. 

They also told me to not fight this as according to the bylaws the HOA is entitled to recover their legal fees from me in case I bring them to court or they bring me to court. So I'll lose either way because legal fees will end up costing me more than the fine itself. 

Not sure if it's relevant, but the office of the HOA looks a lot like a leisure room. They have a pool table, a bar with a fancy fringe and a ton one drinks, a large TV and couches and stuff like that. And this isn't an amenity that is available for the people in the neighborhood, this is the ""relaxation room"" for the HOA officers and board members who are all old retired people. I definitely felt like this fine is for me to fund whatever they have going on there. 

Help? I also want to add that this is a house. Not a condo or apartment. ",legaladvice
TL;DR Airline says I was a no show on flight (but I can prove I was on it) and cancelled my return reservation - Need Advice,"Need advice or help about traveling home to the US.

​

On August 15th, I flew from the US to Croatia with a stop-over in Munich. My return flight to the US is scheduled for September 4th. I booked my flights through online 3rd party budget ticket agent.

​

My problem is that apparently the airline is saying that I was a no show for my flight from Munich to Zagreb in August, even though I was on the plane. They cancelled my future flight with them on September 4th claiming it is their policy to cancel return flights if a passenger no shows. (But again, I didn't no show. I was on the flight.)

​

I have called my travel agent company multiple times but get the same answer - they tell me every time that they need to verify with the airline, put me on hold, and then tell me the airline will not budge - the airline shows me as a no show and won't reinstate my return flight. The travel agency says there is nothing they can do since it is the airline's policy and the agency wants me to purchase a new return flight, which I cannot really afford, and don't think I should have to anyway.

I called the airline directly and they keep saying that their register is showing me as a no show for the Munich to Zagreb flight. But I was on that flight. When I arrived and boarded the plane in Munich, I was told there was not an actual attendant to check us into the flight so we were guided to scan our tickets and board the plane, which I did, along with the other passengers. There are people who sat next to me on the plane and I had conversations with who can witness I was there, besides airport CCTV which I am sure can prove I boarded the plane and exited the plane in Zagreb. I have a visa stamp in my passport from going through the boarder in the airport. It is so scary to me to think this airline allowed someone to board the plane and has no record of them on the flight. What type of security is that??

​

I need help - I am at a stalemate. I am not sure what to do since I was 100% on that flight and it is the airline who made the mistake. I have been recording the names and numbers and taking notes of all my conversations. Can anyone give advice on what I should do? I have 3 more days before my planned return flight should leave. Any help is greatly appreciated.

​

TL;DR My airline made a mistake and said I was a no show even though I was on the flight. Subsequently, they cancelled my upcoming return flight reservation. Neither the airline nor my travel agent will fix it, as they both push it off on each other.

EDIT:

Thank you all for helpful advice and support! There are definitely some suggestions made I would never think of and I will definitely look into. Just some additional information and updates:

Yes, I'm US citizen.

As someone mentioned about the luggage, I did have issues when I landed in Zagreb, none of my checked bags made it to the destination. Looking back, if they thought I was a no-show they might have pulled it from the plane. However, when I landed I didn't know that was a possibility and just thought my bags didn't arrive. I immediately filed a lost baggage claim, called the airline and they confirmed that my bags were on the next flight to Zagreb. I received my bags the next day. While on the call with the airline there wasn't any mention of me not being on a flight.

&#x200B;

I've spent the afternoon on calls with the airline and they haven't changed their position, although they agreed to pull the flight manifest and notify me when they have more information.

&#x200B;

I had already thrown away my printed boarding pass and luggage tags. I'm making a customer services complaint with documentation of an e-boarding pass, iPhone location data showing me in Munich airport and then after the flight to Zagreb airport (the times match the flight), passport visa stamp and luggage tracking sticker. I'll attempt to get the lost luggage form from the airport as well.",legaladvice
A judge refused to marry me due to how I look.,"I'm 22 and so is my fiance. I was in a bit of a jam after losing my job and thus my health insurance, so we decided to just get married earlier than anticipated in order to get on my fiance's health plan. For some context, I have Turner Syndrome so I have a very child-like appearance, and I was doing some treatments with my doctors that can only be covered with insurance.

We planned to marry in our state, NJ but the requirement was we needed a witness...which neither of us have any offline friends and neither of our families approve of our relationship so we decided to marry in Pennsylvania since it is more lax with marriage requirements.

So we get the license and set a date at a courthouse. We go there, and like many other times in my life, the people around were horrified at the prospect of a ""child"" getting married. I provided adequate proof that I am over 18. The judge takes one look at us and he is clearly repulsed. He refuses to marry us, and basically told my fiance he should be ""ashamed"". 

Is it legal that he refused to marry us? We were treated pretty badly and with disrespect. The clerk also assured us nobody was going to be interested in marrying us so we should just not try again. Is there any way we can compel a judge to marry us? We are originally from NJ, trying to marry in PA.",legaladvice
HOA insists my sister and I are not a single-family household and one of us should move out. We've lived here all our lives.,"I'm 21 and my sister is 19. We've lived in this house our entire lives. Our parents bought this house 27 years ago. They joined the HOA about 15 years ago.

My dad died 5 years ago, mom died 6 months ago. We are now the owners of this house.

We've been visited by the HOA multiple times, they're citing that we're not a single-family home anymore since our mom has died. They've told us that according to the terms, only a single family can be resident in the homes and being single family is defined as a person or couple and their legal unmarried children. This meant that my mom could live with me and my sister as it was a single family according to the definition, but me and my sister living here after our mom's death means we are two families of single adults. They want one of us to move out so that this place becomes a single family home again.

They've visited us FOUR times now asking us to leave. They say they don't like to sue our of respect for our parents but they will do that if we continue to refuse to comply by the community rules.

Can they kick one of us out of our own house? What should we expect and how can we fight this?

Houseguest had a deadbolt installed after being reminded that he'll have to leave soon. Questions about the situation in general but specifically the locksmith's liability here. (NY state),"To be clear, this is **not** New York City.

TL;DR: Wife and I let an old friend of hers who is going through a hard time stay with us for a while. When reminded that he'll have to move on soon, he made a pass at my wife and flipped out on her when she declined his advances. He then had a locksmith install a deadbolt on the door, despite not presenting them with a lease or deed to show that he has a right to get locks installed. Now what? Questions at the bottom.

A childhood friend of my wife's (call him Pete) moved back to the area after the death of a parent and losing his job. We offered to let him crash in our spare bedroom for a month or so while he gets things figured out. Pete moved in on 3/28, and we had him sign something that said that he'd split on 6/30 whether he had his shit sorted or not. This was partially to put a hard limit on the amount of time he'd be living with us, but primarily because my brother is going to spend about six weeks in town for work starting in mid-July, and will be staying with us. Pete didn't seem to be in much of a rush to find a new job, let alone find his own place, but he's in a bit of a funk due to the whole situation so we'd been giving him the benefit of the doubt. On 6/1, my wife reminded Pete of the fact that he had to go at the end of the month, he said not to worry and that he'd definitely have something figured it out by then.

She gave him the same reminder this Wednesday (6/12).  I'll spare you the details, but this time Pete countered by confessing that he'd always been in love with her, and that she should leave me and *i* could find a new place while they stay in the apartment (which is sort of funny because while I consider this to be her apartment as much as mine, I purchased it before we met and her name isn't on anything). Anyway, she obviously shut this down immediately, and Pete did not respond well. At all. No violence but a ton of shouting, insulting and attempting to guilt trip. It was intense enough that my wife just cut out to her mother's place, where she called me to fill me in on the situation. I went home from work and told Pete that we'd stick to the agreement despite his behavior, but the sooner he was out, the better. I spoke to my wife later that evening and we decided till Pete fucks off, she'll stay in an investment property of mine that is luckily vacant right now, but I'd start working remotely and stay at the apartment more or less 24/7, both to make sure Pete doesn't do anything stupid and because my presence in the living room would hopefully be more than a little awkward for him.

So this morning around 6:00 I left to run to the office to grab some stuff I'll need while working from home. I got back to the apartment about half an hour ago, and as I stepped out of the elevator I saw a guy with a toolbox leaving my apartment and immediately noticed that a new deadbolt had been installed in the door. I tried to explain the situation to the locksmith but he basically told me that the lock's already in and he gave the only key to the guy in the apartment, so it's between the two of us now. LOVELY. I asked him for a card and he said he didn't have any, so I asked where he works. He told me that it isn't any of my business and reiterated that this is between me and Pete. I followed him downstairs and luckily he was in a van that had a sticker with the company's name and info on the side. I called the number, asked to speak to the boss and told him what had happened. He more or less did his best to not answer any of my questions - ""I'm sorry but I don't have to inform you of our policies."" Fun.

So this is where I am at now. I called the police just to get a report filed, but I am 100% sure that when the officers show up they're going to tell me that it's a civil issue. I'm not expecting them any time soon, as this is a pretty small potatoes deal in the city where the whole thing is taking place. I was actually all set to offer Pete a cash for keys deal if he wasn't getting his shit in gear by 6/23, but I have a feeling that I am going to have to evict now.  I own a few investment properties and have gone through the eviction process before, so I know that will not be a fun process given how tenant friendly my state is, but it is what it is. We've got that vacant rental property to stay in while everything gets sorted out, so that's covered as well. My only questions now are about who I can go after for what.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

On that note, here are my questions:

I am going to lose money on the rental that my wife and I will be staying in while the eviction gets handled. In fact I've already done so, as I had just started advertising it and will now have to pull the listing on a few sites/drop a ""sorry but"" on anyone who responds to print ads I placed. Is this something I can sue for? In my mind I'd name both Pete and the locksmith company in a suit and let the judge decide who owes me what, but since I am making the decision for us to occupy the space, do I technically have damages?

When I got a deadbolt installed at my old rental, I had to show the locksmith a copy of my lease before they'd even touch the door. Was that just a company policy they were following or is that mandated by law? If the latter, is there anything I can go after them for? I don't care if it's trying to get criminal charges pressed or just going the civil route - I am not hurting for money so frankly if I were to sue it would be more about taking the pound of flesh that I feel I am entitled to after they locked me out of my own home, but I'd be just as happy seeing the pound of flesh extracted in a manner that does not end with me in possession of it.

Anything else that I should be thinking about in this situation? I am planning on asking the police to do a civil standby or whatever it's called so I can get a few important things out of the apartment. I am a little flustered and pissed off right now to say the least, so I just want to make sure that there isn't anything I should be considering beyond that.

Thanks in advance, and the cops are actually pulling up now so I might have an update shortly.

Edit 1: Just heard from the owner of the locksmith, who sounded about as pissed off as I am. He's sending a guy over with a new deadbolt and a few extra keys. Apparently he's already arranged for his dude to show up with some cops in case Pete is not a fan of the lock being changed. Bonus: in explaining that part to me, I got to hear somebody say ""I know a guy who knows a guy"" in real life, and now I want to hang out with this dude.

Edit 2: MIL took the wife out to get her mind off of this stuff, but she is now being returned to me so I am gonna stop staring at the internet. The locksmith will be here around 8pm, and Pete's brother is going to swing through around the same time to see if he can talk some sense into him. Thanks for all of the advice and well wishes, I'll try to update again tonight if anything interesting happens but at this point it will more likely be tomorrow/Sunday.",legaladvice
Update. DBAG boss wanted to screw over a former employee with a fake job offer.,"Went to HR this morning and played the audio from the phone call. I also pulled the emails between me and the EVP and handed them over to HR. 

The Chief Personnel Officer pulled me into his office and made me play everything for him. I told him the full story of eveyrthing about the former employee and the EVPs attitude. 

To make him completely understand that I would not let this get buried, I told him that the former employee knows the whole thing. Said that I planned to leave at the end of the week if the EVP situation does not get handled. (Did not tell him about the new job.) 

The CPO thanked me for my honesty, which by the way was a major red flag for me, and said he would be contacting the COO immediately. 

At lunch I was pulled into a meeting with a junior HR person to talk about my performance review. We do not have performance reviews. 

It went badly. 

I was given 5 minutes to pack up my things at my desk and leave. I had had an email typed up on my phone and sent it to the CEO detailing everything. I had typed it up as things happened and pretty much knew I would be cut today. 

Luckily my access had not been cut yet as I received the CC to my personal email back almost immediately. It received a one sentence response of ""Thank you for bringing this to my attention."" 

So all in all I am pretty sure they will not do anything. They just do not realize how many people are leaving with no notice Friday. A LARGE number of people know. ",legaladvice
[Update] [Maryland] Taken By EMTs Against My Will,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7iq9fh/maryland_taken_by_emts_against_my_will)

For those of you who may remember me from a while back, and those who read my original post just now, you're probably wondering why I'm bothering to post this update in the first place. I'll get into that later, but the short answer is that I believe the responses I received to (and the subsequent consequences of) my original post here played an important role in causing me to do a serious amount of self-reflection which resulted in me making serious, positive changes to my life. I suppose you could even call this update a thank-you of sorts. Anyways, on to what actually happened after my original post 8 months ago.

As my edit to the original post implied, I did not get what I wanted from my original post. What I wanted was a bunch of people to tell me what I wanted to hear, and to provide an escape from the consequences of my own reckless behavior. What I got was a whole lot of people reminding me that there was no one to blame but myself, and that I had to now face the consequences of my actions. Naturally, I refused to accept this, and went ahead and ""consulted"" a lawyer. I say consulted for the lack of a better word, as it was more like said lawyer showed me the door shortly after I pleaded my case. 

This, however, did not deter me. If anything, it only invigorated me further. I decided on pro se representation. The first step was, of course, collecting evidence. And by ""collecting evidence"" I of course mean showing up to the fire station that housed the ambulance that picked me up drunk and demand the information I wanted. Luckily, this was at approximately 3am, and only one firefighter was awake at the station at the time.

I suppose I should count myself extremely lucky as he did not immediately call the cops on me, but instead sat there patiently and listened to me as I screamed unintelligible nonsense at him. Even offered to give me a ride home using the departments utility truck. Needless to say, I did not acquire the information I sought out, so I returned home and passed out. 

When I woke up, I woke up to a shit storm. The original post I had made here had apparently been cross-posted to another subreddit, which somehow led to me being doxxed and humiliated by almost everyone who knew me. Even my boss laughed at me. Suppose I should be grateful that I wasn't fired. 

In any event, the humiliation led to me taking a step back and looking into my life with an outside perspective. I hated what I saw. I hated it so much that I swore to myself that I would change. And somehow, I did. Sort of. I never actually ended up filing anything with any sort of court. Good thing too. Would only have served to waste my money and humiliated me further.

I came to the conclusion that I was a functioning alcoholic. A few months ago I began to try the AA route. It was hard, and I released a few times, but as of posting this update, I am over a month clean. I don't really want to get into the details of my recovery, but needless to say the slap in the face I got from the doxxing of the post I originally made here really helped out. 

I won't bore you guys with the details of how I proceeded to clean up my life after that, but I consider myself I seriously different person than I was 8 months ago. And it's all due to a chain of events that was borne from the original post I made to this subreddit, and for that, I'd like to thank you guys.

I suppose I don't have a single reason for actually posting this update, but I hope you guys know that your advice does help people, even if it may not be in the way originally intended. I'd always like this story to be an example for others is situations similar to mine. Really makes true the old saying that if everyone else at the table tells you that you're drunk, then you probably are.",legaladvice
Girlfriend received a DUI in a car that only had 3 wheels.,"This is in West Virginia. Throwaway because she knows my regular account and wouldn't want anyone else to know about this.

My girlfriend and I went out for dinner then bar trivia and drinking. I only had a few drinks the whole evening but she had 5-6 mixed drinks and was very drunk. When it was last call I decided to drive her to her house in her car then uber back to my car and go home myself since I had work the next day.

I put her in the passenger seat of her car and started driving to her house but on the way I hit an awful pothole and busted a tire. I pulled over in a parking lot and started to change the tire but left the keys in the ignition so she would be warm since it was pretty chilly out. 

I jacked the car up and was proceeding to change the tire when a police car pulled into the parking lot and I thought he was going to help me out but instead he asked me if I was drunk. I told him I wasn't and explained I was taking my girlfriend home since she had been drinking. I took a voluntary field test and breathalyzer and blew under the limit. 

He then looked into the car and saw my girlfriend half asleep in the passenger seat and asked her if she was drunk and she said she was just sleepy. He then made her get out of the car and do a field sobriety test, which she failed, and then the breathalyzer where she blew a .10 (legal limit in state is .08). He then placed her under arrest because the keys were in the ignition and she was the only person in the car and intoxicated. Please note that at this time I had NOT finished changing the tire so there were only 3 wheels on the car at the time.

He took her to the city station and after I fixed the tire I went down and bailed her out. My question now is if it was actually a DUI. It seems very silly to me that she was charged since she was buckled up in the passenger seat and there was only 3 wheels on car at that time. We don't want to go through the first time offenders program if possible since it requires a plea and she is afraid it could affect her graduate work at the university. 

Thank you.

All of the upper management at the large bar I work at are either enabling or working together to get incredibly intoxicated women to have sex with them in the staff stairwell and I don't know how to stop this.,"TW: sexual assault

I (22/F) started working at this large 4 story pub/cocktail bar/nightclub in Australia 3 months ago. I worked mainly on the rooftop cocktail bar. A month ago I saw my 40 year old head bartender (S) flirting with a girl who looked barely 18. They disappeared even though he was on the clock and supposed to be supervising me. She, N, was extremely drunk because he kept feeding her drinks. Hours later I ran into her at a bar I went to after my shift, she seemed more sober. We got to chatting and she told me S said he wanted to kiss her and grabbed her hand, pulling her into the staff stairwell. She kept saying she didn't want to have sex, but he kept pushing her until he got her to give him a blow job. She felt uncomfortable about the whole thing. There's an inherent power dynamic at play, plus he's dead sober and she was wasted (unable to consent).

I report this to our head manager two days later for the cocktail bar (D). He immediately tells me not to tell anyone else and he says he will look at the footage. He asks me ""what was she wearing?"" And ""how drunk was she?"" He says women hit on bartenders all the time. Nothing happens and two days after that I run into an old coworker (A). I'm talking to her about this and she tells me D used to constantly sexually harass her, asking to ""see her tits,"" trying to take pics up her skirt with his phone, groping her ass etc. A made a report to upper upper management and HR and nothing happened because in their words, ""as you know, the owner of [name of bar] is currently in a very public sexual assault case with an old employee who he supposedly took advantage of at the company party. Another case would ruin the bar's rep entirely."" 

I then find out after talking to N again (we had exchanged numbers), that almost a year prior when N was visiting the bar, manager D pulled her into the stairwell too, when she was so drunk she could hardly walk. She kept saying ""no"" and he took her hand and shoved it down his pants, pushed her against a wall etc., until she shoved him and left. He didn't rape her, but he did force her to touch him, quite violently. A had also told me that bartender S and D would work together to target drunk women and take turns taking them to the stairwell. 

I was so sickened by all of this that I then reported it to the highest manager, R. I only reported N's story about S (sorry for all the confusion) because that was the most recent one, which I was sure was on camera. R wasn't surprised and said he'd have a look at the camera footage. I then find out the next day, from overhearing a manager in the stairwell (sound echoes) that apparently the footage was DELETED from that night, probably by D who I reported it to first. 

I'm sorry this was all over the place and very confusing. I know most of it is hearsay but after seeing my management's responses I am very concerned by the predatory behavior which is allowed at the bar. Is there anything I can do, from a legal standpoint, to try and stop this. I'm worried for women who come to the bar. I'm disgusted by how much this is brushed off. I am consistently sexually harassed at the bar and nothing happens when I report it (another less important story). Can the police do anything? Thank you.",legaladvice

[CA] A student at the preschool I work at is only being taught a fictional language,"I'm twenty, and I work part-time as an assistant at a small daycare in California.

There is a four year old who speaks very very little and poor English. Knows the most basic of words but is at the level of maybe a two year old English-wise compared to the other kids, including several who are both native Spanish/English speakers. Basically knows ""yes"", ""no"", ""juice"", etc. 

He's only been here for less than a month and I've seen his incredibly limited vocab double in that time. I'm embarrassed to say it but I'm very uneducated about this type of thing and I thought he was speaking Portuguese or something similar up until last week. The kids are split into small groups by age and I'm usually not in charge of his group unless it's at the end of the day, in my defense.

The hosts of the daycare are very into nerd culture and some of the daycare is very decorated with (child friendly) sci-fi and fantasy stuff. I'm not too into it myself but I like listening to them and I (usually) like their passion.

One day I was curious what language the child was speaking so I looked up what Portuguese actually sounded like and realized it wasn't that. Looked up a lot of languages and for the life of me could not identify it. The single dad who picked him up looked like a nice dude and one day he was one of the last people to pick up that day so I asked him what language his kid spoke.

The bosses of the daycare were there too when I asked and they all suddenly got big smiles on their faces and explained to me in depth that the guy was a linguistics hobbyist who was trying to recreate an experiment where he raises his kid to speak a language from the tv show Star Trek (klingon.)

He explained how at home he only has spoken Klingon (which is apparently a real full language) to the kid and that's all he knows. My bosses LOVE that he is doing this and he does too, he told me to look up the experiment and read about it. My bosses even learned a small bit of the language themselves so that when they talk to the kid they don't say it. 

It sounded kinda cool at the time but I didn't really think about it too much. When I looked it up I found out that the guy who did it taught his kid Klingon AND English at the same time. I assumed that this guy was doing the same and I just misunderstood but when I clarified next time he confirmed that the kid was ONLY being taught Klingon on purpose and he was going to try and continue the ""experiment"" for as long as possible. 

He also told me about his blog and I checked it out where he describes this all and he basically states in it that he is fully aware that this will make it ""slightly"" hard for the kid to speak english later but that the experience is worth it. He even has limited the kids intake of media very severely so far to avoid shows with a lot of speaking/words.

The kid is fairly isolated and generally acts a bit socially ""off"", if I can say that without being mean. Not like misbehaving but he clearly has small issues interacting with kids his age who all talk a lot already.

I've brought it up casually with my bosses but they basically love this dude and what he is doing and don't see a problem with it. I feel terrible but I feel like I should report this? Is this child abuse? This guy basically is mispurposely not teaching his kid to how to interact with other people for the level of ""it's just a social experiment bro"", it's nuts to me.

If I'm wrong and this isn't dangerous I apologize. It feels awful to me though. I like my job otherwise but if I had to lose it for this i could find another one, have some savings, i feel too bad for this kid.",legaladvice
"[California] We are a small indie porn company. Former model wants her videos removed, unwilling to buy the copyright. Sends threatening messages. [Update]","https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6xjs4q/california_we_are_a_small_indie_porn_company/

There is a lot to discuss. We did a little research and turned out her stories about getting married and her husband wanting the videos to go down were lies. She in fact is starting a membership program on her own website and wanted to use that excuse to get our videos at reduced prices, to post them later to her own website. She wanted to use the exclusivity to get some of our paid members and have a larger library at launch.

Once she realized that we know of her plan, she offered to pay the full $700,000 however, we declined since we have no interest in allowing her to use our videos to compete with us. She even offered to pay $1 million if we agreed to take down the videos immediately upon the sale.

"[Update] [Oregon] Neighbor cut down several trees on my property, claiming they were a hazard.","Hey everyone! By the examples I saw, it seems I should link my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/

Anyways, rather than updating the original post again, I wanted to let everyone know where I'm at! This is beginning from the end of my last update on the original post, which detailed how I went to the police, found the company that did the job, and called the city to find there was no permit issued/documentation related to my address. Below is the official update!


I have called a lawyer! After some in-depth searching and a few calls, I have connected with a relatively local lawyer (I'm a bit rural) and we talked for about an hour. He wanted ALL the details I had, especially when I mentioned the arborist; he asked for the number and told me was going to ask for additional information from the inspection that would be important for a lawsuit. He also gave me the number of a surveyor, and told me I should call them asap. He then set me up with an appointment at his offices next week after the arborist's visit. As far as the criminal charges, he told me that was my call, but we could talk more about it next week. He did comment that making a police report was a smart move, so thank you reddit for that advice!! Lastly, he told me not to contact the neighbor anymore, to get a written/signed testimony from the witness neighbor, and to report any documents in the mail from either my neighbor or the company that did the job, as well as refusing contact should the neighbor come to my door. I asked if I could continue updating you all and he said that was fine so long as I don't disclose personal information (which I won't obviously!)

So it looks like I'm taking my neighbor's ass to court! I hope somehow I can get my trees back, even just having new ones planted. That area of my property is so barren now :'( I'll be sure to update if more information comes to light that I can share, and of course, if it gets there, to what happens when it's all over! Thank you so much again for the advice!!!",legaladvice
"[GA] Our Baby was billed for its own delivery resetting deductible and costing us $3,5000","Hey everyone,

Thanks for reading over this. My wife gave birth 3 months ago and, when going through the bills, we noticed that our baby was billed for its own delivery. Conveniently (for the insurance company), this meant that it applies towards my son's deductible ($3,500) instead of my wife's which had been fully met at that point due to an earlier hospital stay. Our insurance covers in-network hospitalizations fully after the deductible has been met. Our insurance provider is saying that this is required under a ""State Mandate"" in Georgia but I can't find any reference to this. If anyone has any experience with health care law or can tell us anything helpful here it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for all of the incredible helpful replies! I'm slammed at work and can't respond individually but I will try to follow up tomorrow. I've submitted an appeal to the hospital to have them review the charges and they are going to send me an itemized bill. If they confirm that the charges are, in fact, related to the care of the baby instead of delivery, then it sounds like I will end up needing to pay the second deductible. I will let you know how it gets resolved. Thanks again!",legaladvice
"Neighbor's kid got hurt jumping over my fence. My fence is in good order and so is the grass beneath it, the jump itself is what hurt him. Father is irate. Need specifics on what to do.","I woke up at 5AM this morning to screaming. My neighbor's son, who is 13, tried to get over my 8 foot privacy fence. He used a ladder on the outside of the fence and then jumped the 8 feet down. He landed badly and broke his leg.

His leg was visibly broken so I called an ambulance. I asked him to tell me his parents' phone number so I could call them but he refused to give it and I didn't want to leave him alone in my yard with a broken leg so I waited until they arrived. A police car showed up first and they did not want me to leave so one officer went to get his parents and the other stayed with us. The parents got over just as he was being put in the ambulance out front and the first officer was writing down what happened with me out back. His parents went in the ambulance with him and the police told me they would contact me if they needed anymore information. So I never spoke directly with the parents.

The receptionist at my workplace said that he showed up looking for me this morning just after 8. She said he was visibly angry, swearing and implying that she was ""hiding"" me from him (I was just not there). He identified himself by name and told her to send me the message that I should man up and find him before he finds me. They said he also specifically brought up that he went to my house and I have locked my gate, so he can't get in to see where his son fell.  They will be calling the police if he comes back.

I am hoping for answers about the following questions that I have.

1. Based on the account from work, the father seemed extremely angry, even for the circumstances, and even a vague threat is still worrisome. I was planning to talk to the police this afternoon and inform them of what happened at my workplace. Unless there is any reason I should not do that?

2.  I am intending to contact my homeowners insurance this afternoon and alert them to the situation. Also want to confirm that's the right move.

3.  As I said he specifically brought up the fact that when I left my house after all this, I locked the gate. There was not a special reason for this, I just keep it locked all the time and saw no reason not to, the police had not mentioned anything about coming back for any reason. If the child's father does want to look inside my yard at the area where he fell, should I let him, or should I not? And on that note, should I talk to him in general or should I be going straight to have everything go through a lawyer?

Thank you for any input you might have. I think there's a firm grip on this, I just want to make sure my plan is right and I'm not setting myself up for anything here.

I found two websites illegally publishing my knitting and crochet patterns. (Maine),"Long story short I have a store online (through Etsy and Ravelry) where I publish knitting and crochet patterns. I sell them and make a good amount of sales and a decent little income for a graduate student. 

All of my patterns are published and Etsy says they become copyrighted the second they are published. I also have a copyright notice within the pattern and in the item's listing description noting that it is illegal to claim this pattern as your own and publish it anywhere. 

Today I found all of my patterns listed on two different websites. One is French and the other doesn't explicitly say where they are based out of. They are both selling my patterns extremely cheap and obviously illegally. 

What can I do to prevent this from continuing? I've heard of cease and desist letters (this is a somewhat common issue in the knitting and crochet pattern designing community) but do I need a lawyer to write it and send it? I've never had this issue and would appreciate any advice on where to go from here. 

Just some notes:
I have not yet contacted either website. 
My shop first opened in October of 2017 and I publish new patterns about every other month. 
I only sell my patterns on two sites (Etsy and Ravelry).
Neither of the websites in question are associated with the websites I sell my patterns on. 

*Very minor addition:* neither site is USA based. The first is all in French and the other mentions Germany in their about section so I'm assuming they're German. ",legaladvice

The city mowed my wildflower meadow! (TX),"We have a property with a drainage easement that contains a detention pond, basically a 20'x20' concrete box.  This is part of the city stormwater system - the water from the street gutter goes into the detention pond to slowly absorb into the ground, absorbing some some of the street runoff and preventing erosion.  The detention pond is near the curb but behind mature trees, so it is accessed through a 70'x30' clearing adjacent to the pond.  We are in a forested area - everything except that clearing has mature trees covering it.

&#x200B;

Every 5-7 years the city brings heavy equipment to dredge the pond.  They come to the door ahead of time, and I've worked with them on making sure they have adequate access to get to the pond as required by the drainage easement.  That's why the 70'x30' clearing exists.  This crew is great by the way - they know how to correctly prune trees and only clear what is necessary to get the job  done.

&#x200B;

In this cleared area, we've converted it into a wildflower meadow.  This is the optimal use for this land - wildflowers come back wonderfully on disturbed soil and this site has heavy equipment trample it up every 5 years.  My wife and I are master gardeners who have a passion for pollinators.  As this is such a forested area, there is nowhere else on our property that we have the sunny conditions necessary for these kinds of wildflowers and we have spent a great deal of time and money working on this area, including travelling around the state for pollinator host plants and other uncommon native plants to help re-establish their populations.  We've spend 2-3 hours each week since early spring weeding to make sure that this area was 100% wildflowers.

&#x200B;

Yesterday (5/21/2019) we heard string trimmers operating and looked out the window to see that our wildflower area was being destroyed.  It had been completely mowed down by the time we had run out to talk to the crew.  It was an easter seals crew hired by the city to clear the detention pond.  The pond itself had very few weeds in it - it had been dredged recently and was nearly perfect.  However, they also mowed the 70'x30' clearing next to the pond... our beloved and well-maintained wildflower meadow.

&#x200B;

I spoke to the crew leader and he said that they have a list of ponds to mow, and that that some have wildflower exceptions (ours does not).  He told us who to contact at the city to get that added, I've since left that person a voice mail and haven't heard back.  I've been given empty promises from the city before (more on that later), so although this may end up being a solution, I simply do not trust the city until I have something in writing.

&#x200B;

I asked to see the map that shows where the crew is supposed to mow.  When he showed it to me, the highlighted area contained ONLY the detention pond - the 70'x30' clearing is not in the highlighted area.  I pointed this out, and he responded with ""they always do two tractor widths on each side too"".  When pressed to define that further, he clarified it to 6 feet.  However:

1. They did not mow the entire highlighted part - some of the detention pond itself was untouched
2. They mowed more than 6' away from the detention pond
3. They only mowed the side of detention pond with the wildflower area, they did not clear any of the other 3 sides

&#x200B;

Not only is all of our hard work ruined, but I know that we had monarch and pipevine swallowtail caterpillars pupating in that area that have been destroyed.  Now that the wildflowers are mowed down, weeds and invasive species are going to take over and we'll have to spend more time and effort clearing those out instead of enjoying something we loved.

&#x200B;

There was no reason at all to clear the wildflower area - it does not affect the performance of the detention pond at all, nor does it prevent access.  Although it is in part of the drainage easement, I don't believe that they have the right to cause damage for no reason.  I think that the city hired a poorly-trained crew (could not determine that their work was detrimental) and sent them at a time when the work wasn't needing to be done.

&#x200B;

My questions for the legal team about what can I do?  In a perfect world, the things I'd like to happen are:

\- Not having the city ever send a mowing team out to my property ever again.  I'm not familiar with how easements work, I know they'll always do the heavy work every 5-7 years which is fine, but there's no need for their substandard mowing crews in times between the dredging work

\- Being compensated for the damage done

\- Better training for the mowing crew so that they don't cause ecological harm to future sites

&#x200B;

Sidenote - The last time the city dredged the pond we were told that they would seed the clearing with rye grass seed.  Instead, they dumped a load of sand and never came back.  We've since addressed it by adding loads of organic matter in the soil and finding plants that like the sandy conditions, but that was another promise broken.

&#x200B;

I've also talked to the pond inspectors who come out from time to time and they assured me that the city would not mow down the wildflowers.  Nothing has ever been in writing or true.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  I've spoken with an easter seals supervisor and confirmed that the crew did not follow the map they were given.  The map has blue ""cut lines"" that terminate at the detention pond.  The crew is not supposed to go beyond that.  The entire wildflower area is outside of the designated cutting area",legaladvice

So it's been an extremely rough couple of months and seems to only keep getting worse honestly and I'm sad to say there is no happy ending here. I didn't even want to do an update but so many people seemed to be interested in the original and update.

So where to start, still haven't found him and the legal help I have is really great but they are also very overworked and the resources needed to track him down just take time to get and more time to find him. As a final parting gift it seems he claimed our child on his taxes from last year so he could get that tax credit. I was hoping we could track him down that way but again sometime that takes time and resources. Which technically since he was the one working and did live with us for over 6 months of the year he is technically entitled to in a legal sense.

The bank was somewhat kind of understanding during the holidays but the calls are getting to the point where I'm fairly certain they will begin foreclosure soonish I really don't know that for certain but when you don't pay a mortgage for 4+ months they get kind of upset and the circumstances don't matter.

Finally managed to get on SNAP for food and it helps a lot but it's crazy how quickly you realize how much food you eat and your kid eats and before when money didn't really matter for necessities like food, soap, water bills and electricity.

I managed to get a job that somewhat works for childcare hours but you quickly start to realize childcare costs as much as you make so it's like working so you can pay you have your kid watched. Trying to avoid paying all the bills attached to the house I can so I can save up enough to hopefully get us the smallest cheapest apartment around and keep working.

Sorry for the negative update everyone but it's just life I guess. Unless things extremely and drastically change for the better this will be the last update. I'll keep doing my best of course and thanks for all the kind words in the other posts about the other updates.

My wife and I bought our home a little over a year ago. Today a lawyer came to our door and told us that the previous owners were in a lawsuit with the construction company that built the home. They settled and would like to split the settlement with us 50/50. Does this sound legit?,"This is a surprise and my wife and I aren't sure how to approach this. We are upset that we weren't made aware of this when buying the house. The settlement money is for construction defects of the house and we feel that since we bought the house from the previous owner, we should receive more of the monetary amount to go towards repairs.

The lawyer indicated to us that if we wish to receive more than 50% of the settlement, he would reimburse us from his firm . This is a class action lawsuit that includes 40 some other homes. He needs everyone's signature to receive the settlement from the construction company. 

My question is if this is legitimate?

Is there a breach of contract somewhere with the previous owners or the real estate company since we weren't made aware of a pending lawsuit that would make clear construction defects of the home?

Any advice would be appreciated.

"During the process of repairing an acquaintance's laptop, I found a folder containing several videos and photos of child pornography. I'm freaking out about it, and don't know exactly how I should handle telling the authorities.","Throwaway Account for obvious reasons

Quick background: I work in IT Security, but have a few side jobs that I do for fun/extra money. One of those side jobs is repairing laptop computers, tablets, cell phones, etc. I also do custom PC builds for people as well.

So, the way I network is through word of mouth, and business cards. Long story short, a guy at my kickboxing academy approached me and asked if I could fix his laptop. He told me he was having performance issues, and complained that his PC freezes and blue screens with no warning.

I go through the normal routine, and have him sign a contract agreeing to pay me for my services, as well as granting me full control over the device while I carry out repairs, etc. 

He agreed, and asked that if the computer can't be fixed, at least recover his files to the best of my ability and place them on an external drive for safe keeping. 

Now, I have a big disclaimer that I have the person sign off on that literally reads as follows: ""I will respect the privacy of your data, however I will look into any area that the problems you're having may lead me to. That being said is there anything on the computer that you would not want me to see?"" if the user says yes, I tell them to clean up the computer and bring it back when its safe for me to look at. I'm not interested in looking at naked pictures of the guy or his wife, for example. This guy said no, and signed off on the disclaimer.

long story short, the laptop was an older model but I was able to get everything up and running again. However, this is where the story gets messed up. 

After running a quick virus scan on the machine, I notice over 100 malicious items being found. 80ish of which were located in ONE FOLDER. So, I crack open the folder to take a look, as a lot of people download malicious software without really knowing what they're getting into. 

Well, I found an entire series of photos and videos on the computer. I clicked one (stupidly) and saw a young girl (pre-adolescent) engaged in sexual activity with an adult. The others had similar file names, and were clearly pornographic videos and photos from what little I could see in the thumbnail. Honestly, I've never felt more sick to my stomach than I did last night when I saw that picture.

My mind is a mess right now. I couldn't sleep last night and I'm not really sure what to do. I took screen shots of the file system to prove that they were last modified/viewed BEFORE I received the computer as to not implicate myself in any way. 

How in the Hell am I supposed to report this?

"Fined $13,066 from the TSA for grabbing my insulin pump","<edited to add location - incident happened in Austin, TX, I live in FL>

I travel a lot for work, and am a Type 1 diabetic who uses an insulin pump.  The pump manufacturer told me when I received my new pump that it cannot go through any x-ray machine, full body scanner, etc.  When I go through the TSA line, I hold my pump out and tell them it cannot go through.  


Every time before this particular incident, they understood the protocol when I give my spiel, take the pump, let me pass through the full body scanner, have my carry-on x-rayed, then as soon as I step through the full body scanner, they swab my pump, hand it back to be, and I go on my way.


This time it was different.  I did my usual spiel, held my pump out, and the TSA agent seemed flabbergasted.  She grabbed a plastic bowl, put my pump in it, and set it aside.  Told me to walk through the scanner, which I did (with no problem).  She told me to wait for another TSA agent to come and swab the pump.  No problem here.  Unusual from what I was used to, but I'm okay with it.


Just some context, my blood sugar was high and I need that pump attached to me to take extra insulin to bring my blood sugar down.  I didn't take any extra before going through the line, as I thought I'd get it right back, as I always do (after they swab it of course).


A couple minutes go buy, and this TSA Agent keeps going about her business waving people through the line, with me still standing there, and her not acknowledging me.  I walk over, tap her on the shoulder, and say ""hey can you please address my pump as I need it back.""  She says yes but I will need to call another agent over to swab it, and radio's for another TSA agent to come over to address.  I wait another couple minutes (felt like an eternity, and I am starting to feel like shit from the high blood sugar, coupled with the anxiety from being ignored).


I tap on her should again, express the urgency, and again she says sure and radio's another TSA agent over to swab the pump.  Another couple minutes go by, and no other TSA agent is responding, and she is going on her merry way scanning other people through the machine.


Here's where is fucked up.  I was so paranoid and out of it from my high blood sugar and lack of insulin, that I grabbed the pump out of the bowl, attached it to my body, and went to my gate.  


About 45 minutes later, 3 TSA Agents came to my gate, took me back to the scanning area, and interrogated me.  I was fully cooperative, apologetic, explained the medical condition, etc.  After I explained everything, they were very nice and apologetic to me too.  But they said they had to fill out an incident report.  Photographed my drivers license, the pump, me, etc.  Said I would be getting a letter in the mail, probably a warning, and not to stress about it.


Fast forward a week later and I get an official letter from the TSA in the mail saying I need to provide my side of the story, stating that I was in violation of Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R) 1540.105(a)(1), which is subject to a fine of up to $13,066 per violation.


The letter does not provide the actual language of the above Regulation, nor an assertion of how I violated the Regulation.  They stated I have 20 days to provide my defense, in writing, with any information that I wish to be considered in their investigation.


A few questions:


1.  Should I consult an attorney and have them help me draft my response?

2.  If not, how should I word my response?  I can't refute leaving the TSA area with my pump (which I admit, was stupid, it was caught on camera).  


3.  Will my medical issues provide them with enough mitigating circumstances to drop the case against me?   I am thinking right now about explaining why I acted the way I did, and ignoring the fact that I walked away like an idiot.


Thanks in advance for any help.  $13k is a shitload of money.  Will I face jail time if I cannot pay?  I was an idiot, but felt under duress due to my medical condition and the TSA negligently withholding my medication. ",legaladvice
Someone kept stealing my food. So I poisoned it.,"Location:  Mississippi

Last week, I made my lunch as normal, loaded the browie with laxative.  I then wrapped the brownie in paper.  On the paper I wrote the following:  **POISON, DO NOT EAT**.   I put it in the bag, which also had the same written warning applied.  In big, clear, black sharpie, it said, ""**POISON, DO NOT EAT**""  I left it in the fridge as normal went went about my day.  Sure enough, about four hours later the EMS had arrived.  A coworker found the brownie and took the bait, and was being taken to the ER.

When my daughter was 9 months old, she had health problems and was in and out of the hospital for about 2-3 months. The doctors ordered a muscle biopsy on her thigh (she had had one on her heart and they thought she had mitochondrial disease) and had a medical student do it. The first time they didn't go deep enough and had to cut her open and redo the cutting of her muscle. After we done some digging and talking to her new doctors the results were inconclusive and they had no answers for us (this is 8 years later) She's now got a 4 inch scar that's deep and tight on her thigh and it bothers her terribly. It's so tight and big that it affects her walking. They sent her home on hospice with it open and not sewed shut.

[Final Update] I was fraudulently registered to vote. Might get deported. HELP.,"[CA] I took my citizenship oath and I registered to vote that very night online! 

So that's it for my immigration journey and fear of deportation.


I haven't kept up with what happened to the president of the club once I took my oath to be honest. I can't offer any juicy resolution there. My attorney was the one to update me on that situation, but once my naturalization happened and USCIS was permanently off my back, my pro-bono attorney dropped off the map (which it totally fine because legal aid attorneys are probably drowning in cases and I wasn't a priority anymore. Please consider donating to a local legal aid. They work so hard.)

So that's it. I'm here to stay. Thanks for all of the support and kind messages sent my way. It definitely balanced out the death threats and kill yourself messages.

"Just found out my Sapphire ring is fake, do I have any recourse?","I recently noticed that my wedding ring has been catching on my clothes more than usual.

"Illinois. My mother has 300+ cats in her house, and an entire bedroom full of birds. Help.","I moved to Europe for work a decade ago, and have not been back to the States for nearly 3 years, since my dad died. I felt bad leaving my mother alone, however money was tight and I was not able to afford to visit. She had numerous friends so I assumed she'd be ok.

I came to visit finally, yesterday, and my mother's health, unfortunately, seems to have declined more than she let on.

The whole house is *full* of cats. Hundreds of cats, some of them look to be pregnant, and some of them already have litters. 300 may be an understatement. I asked her where they came from and she didn't have an answer for me. I told her she needs to get rid of them but she insisted they were better off with her.

To make matters worse, the guest room has been filled entirely with various birds. Parakeets, finches, a *swan* (she says it's a swan) and various others I can't identify. I estimate there's 50+ birds, and they too look as if they've been breeding.

All the animals have food afaik, but the smell is unbearable and this cannot be sanitary. You can't move without stepping on a cat. Who do I call? The police? I'd prefer if there was a way to resolve this without her getting charged for animal cruelty, she's just a harmless old lady who is suffering from dementia.

My 5 year old son got punched in the face on the school bus,"I never thought I would have to worry about my son being hurt at school. And not even a month into kindergarten. What happened was that my son gave his friend a picture he drew and the kid next to him took it from him and tore it up. So he told him that he was going to to tell the bus driver and the kid punched him in the face. All the kids got off the bus except my son. The bus driver told me that there was an incident involving my son and another kid. I get on the bus and my son has a bloody nose, blood splatter on his arms, his shirt and pants. His dad had to fill out a report about what happened. My son was spitting up blood for over an hour. Me and his dad took our son to school the next morning and tried to have a meeting with the principal and said that she wasn't In at the moment. And that they would contact me before the end of the school day. And they didn't. That was my fault, I should have called regardless. I asked them if there would be any disciplinary action towards the other kid and they didn't really give me a response. He even took the bus home from school that day! He wasn't suspended from school or from the bus. It's almost like he just got talked to and nothing happened. What should the school be doing? We live in California.I want to know what I actions I can take to make sure that this kid won't ever bother my son again.

[Michigan] Teen staying with us for past 8 months. How to get him emancipated or get custody of him?,"
EDIT: Thank you all, thank you so much for the advice you've given me and for the outpouring of love for my husband,Ian, Kevin and me. Thank you for the numerous private messages I recieved, and for the multiple offers I got to open up a gofundme for our legal fees. Fortunately my parents and in laws who took Kevin in as easily as we did already offered to help us pay for all of that, but thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindness and empathy.

After some recommendations from commenters, we contacted our local LGBTQ center and shelter to do the right thing at the right time. We will meet with them and their lawyer tomorrow, and they already gave us 2 recommendations for family law attorneys they worked with. We will then proceed as our attorney sees fit, and I will update you on Kevin's fate. Thank you all so much, you are a great community. Keep on loving.


Last year my son [Ian, 15] befriended a new kid at school [Kevin, 15]. On NYE, Ian asked us if Kevin could spend the night because his parents were out of town and he didn't want to be alone. The next morning, Kevin left but came back 2 hours later asking Ian if he could stay one more night. It wasn't a problem for us. After the third night Kevin stayed at our place we asked to call his mother to check she was okay with him staying. He said she didn't care and refused to answer when we pressed further. Atfer a bit of debating, we took Ian aside and told him we didn't mind Kevin staying but if he had run away from home we should know and let his mother know he was safe. Ian then told us that Kevin's mother had threw him out and didn't want him to come back. Ian wouldn't say why so we asked Kevin to join us and told him unless he told us the whole story he couldn't stay because we didn't want to be liable for anything.

Well in the fall Kevin fell in love with another boy, and he decided that NYE was a good time to tell his parents because he wanted to start the new year by being himself. His parents didn't take the news well and told him ""Get the fuck off my house"". He then spent the night at our house thinking they were in shock and went back the next morning to talk to them. They didn't change their mind and forbade him from going back, saying he would rape and corrupt his young brother and he was no longer their son and wouldn't be until he found his way back to the ""right path"". He started crying when telling us the story so we left him alone. I asked for his mother's number which he gave me and I called her saying Kevin was at our place and could we talk to them to see if things could get better. She basically told me to fuck off and to keep her ""sick deviant son"" or to just put him on the streets and forget about him.

Of course I wasn't about to do that. So I asked if we could come get some of his stuff like clothes and school material. We went there (just my husband and me) and while we gathered Kevin's belongings, she kept insulting him and his homosexuality and telling us we would rot in hell for helping him. My husband told her to shut the fuck up and we came home to the boys.

Kevin has been with us since then. We kept sending his mother texts and pictures and updates in hope she would change her mind and realise that her son needs her. We were waiting for her to come back and take him back and be a fucking parent. So we just let time slip and didn't do anything. We treated Kevin as our son and grew to love him as such.

Last week was his birthday. We threw a party with friends and family and invited his parents. During the day, Kevin got a text from his mother saying : ""15 years ago I gave birth to a son and today I wish I didn't. You live in sin. I can no longer call you my son as I can't have love for a twisted human. I wish you no harm but I don't wish you happiness and as long as you think it is normal for a man to love another man,  you will no longer be part of the family. Enjoy living with the sinners you belong to"".

As soon as Kevin showed us the text my husband was in the car to go see her. She told him basically the same thing. Either we keep Kevin or we throw him out, she doesn't care. There is no doubt, from the multiple times we tried to talk to her, that she won't change her mind. We asked Kevin what he wanted to do, and we had a meeting with his therapist (we sent him to therapy around February because he started cutting himself, refused to eat or leave his room). Kevin wants to be free of his mother.

So my question is, what are the steps? Can he be emancipated? Can we get legal custody of him? Can we adopt him? We always had hope his parents would change his mind but after his birthday we know they won't. We love Kevin as if he were our son and we don't want him to suffer any more than he already has suffered. My husband and I are not educated when it comes to the law and we are at lost. Any advice will be more than welcome. Thank you.

[Update] I was fraudulently registered to vote. Might get deported. HELP.,"California. 

Hey there! So I lawyered up - a huge thank you to legal aids and nonprofits! 

It made it a lot easier. Police report was filed- and the registration has been retracted as a fraud (pending investigation). I have the president of the club admitting to it in e-mail because she freaked when I told her my lawyer would like to have a word about the situation. She said: ""I wouldn't have registered you to vote if I had known you were a fucking illegal."" All communication was given to police. 

My lawyer contacted USCIS and explained everything and provided the police reports, and they said they should be kept informed but they were taking no action as of now. 

My attorney isn't worried as the fraud is well documented. 

So that's about it. No deportation.

"Neighbor keeps flying drone above privacy fence, recording us during private moments..","I'm trying to figure out what the laws are in TX for drones in neighborhoods. 

Not long ago I was sick and went out into my backyard with my husband to get some fresh air. He went back inside and went to the bathroom. Due to being unwell, I suddenly needed the bathroom (we have 2) and went to rush inside, but my husband had locked the door out of habit and couldn't hear me banging on the door. Someone must've heard, because suddenly I heard a drone approaching. This camera-equipped drone flew over our fence and had the camera pointed at me for a good 5+ minutes while I desperately knocked on the door, doubled over, trying to get my husband's attention. It was pretty embarrassing, and I'm sure whichever neighbor owns it got a kick out of it (and who knows if they showed the video to anyone else). 

Since then, there have been numerous times when my husband has gone out for an early morning cigarette while wearing nothing but his underpants, only for the drone to fly up and stay pointed at him until he comes back inside. 

I'm agoraphobic and don't leave my house unless I'm with my husband. I bought a washing line just to give myself an excuse to get outside more, because I'm otherwise cooped up inside 24hrs a day, 5+ days a week. I've now stopped going out in my own yard for more than a couple of minutes in case this drone comes to record me. We have a 6ft privacy fence just so I could feel comfortable in my backyard, but that doesn't help with a drone. 

If this drone were to get ~~""taken out""~~ knocked down by my husband while above our property, forcing the pilot to come and retrieve it, what is the liability there? I also don't know if it's worth mentioning, but we have a local air force base. We're probably ~15 miles away from it, but our house is directly below the flight path and we have military planes fly over, very closely, on a daily basis. Is this drone being flown in proximity to the flight path of any significance in an aviation law aspect?


*Edit: Definitely didn't expect this post to get do much attention. I've woken up to dozens of messages, a lot saying the same things such as ""buy your own drone and follow it/crash it into theirs"" and ""learn how to hack and disable it"", as well as some other VERY illegal suggestions.

"(OK) Apartment complex that offers trash removal service is threatening to charge me $25 per bag of garbage (15 bags total) that are outside my door if I don't take it to the dumpster myself, but I moved out 5 weeks ago and it's not my trash.","This is a strange situation, so stick with me please. So my lease for this apartment ends July 31st. Early in the spring, I decided I didn't want to renew as I wanted something cheaper. I found a house that worked better for me and the lease for that started June 1st, so I have two places in my name as of right now. I moved out of the apartment in the second week of June and I have been living in the house ever since, while still paying rent for the apartment to finish out the lease.

I get a call from the apartment complex today, saying they've received complaints of trash outside my apartment door (which is where we are supposed to leave our trash bags for the trash service to pick up and take to the dumpster). She said they have a photo of 15 bags of trash in the area near my front door where trash is supposed to be. She said that the trash service only takes away one bag of trash a day, and they are going to charge me $25 per bag of trash if I don't take it to the dumpster myself. 

I inform the woman that I moved out last month, and told her that they are welcome to enter the apartment to confirm I am no longer there, as it is 100% cleaned out. She told me that she will call my neighbor, who with the way the front doors are positioned, puts his trash bags in the same place as me. She said she will check with him and if he disputes it, they will go through the trash and it will be ""obvious who's it is"". 

The reason I am resisting taking it out myself, is that I live on the third floor of what I will call an outdoor apartment building, meaning that when I open my front door, I am outside (versus closed apartment buildings where you open your front door to an indoor hallway). It's been 100 degrees with humidity, I'm on the third floor, and even once I walk down the two flights of stairs to the bottom, I am a football field length away from the nearest dumpster. I am a girl, so I would only be able to handle two trash bags at a time, which would mean 8 trips up and down two flights of stairs, in the heat walking all the way across the complex in the sun.

I have a strong feeling my neighbor is going to dispute it, and they are going to believe him over me, as he is a 40 something year old doctor at the local hospital, and I am a mid twenties college student at the local university.

"(Md) I think my dead son's boss might have contributed to his death, but nobody will listen to me","My son was never a good kid, from very young he pushed boundaries with everyone and got really into drugs and alcohol. I'm saying this because it explains a lot.

He first started using heroin when he was 15. According to him he basically got addicted immediately. But when he was 19, after being kicked out of the house, arrested a couple times, he Came to us and finally asked for help. He eventually got clean and stayed clean for a little over a year, was starting to put together a life.

He got his first job at age 20. It was as a busser at a local restaurant. Though he was excited at first, eventually it became clear this was a toxic environment.

One of the owners, who I will call 'Sara' took a particular dislike to my son. She would call him and other busser with a similar backstory (1+ year sober addict) ""the junkies"" to their faces. She would steal shifts from my son because he didn't come in wearing the logoed shirt for the restaurant, but rather a very similar black polo without the logo (this was common practice for other employees, as they were only given one uniform shirt, and nobody seemed to have any issue with that). 

After four months of working there I wake up late one night to find him overdosing on our couch, and he dies. Mind you, he had been clean for a month over a year at this point, and seemed like he was happy with that, so I was in shock.

Anyway, as for my legal question, a month ago (around a month and a half after his death) a women who introduced herself as a manager/bartender at the place he had worked knocked on my door and said she wanted to show me a video. She explained that she had been worried about how 'Sara' treated son for a while, so on the day my son died when Sara started to pick a fight with him she secretly recorded it on her phone.

The video shows Sara drunkenly screaming at my son as he tries to do his job. She is telling him that he is a waste of time and space and should just fucking kill himself. Taunting him and asking him if he is back to sticking a needle into his arm yet so she can fire him. She even takes a swing at him.

Mind you, this is in the middle of dinner service and in front of customers. I strongly suspect this is what triggered his relapse (and what I suspect was more a suicide then a simple relapse). 

My question was if I had any legal recourse against the restaurant based on their treatment of my son. The other manager that gave me the video also said that she could probably find some people who witnessed other similar incidents. 

But the thing is that anyone I bring this up to in my small town just laughs and blows it off. When I brought it to the local lawyer his exact words were, ""Well he was a fucking junkie, you want to sue the only people who were stupid enough to hire him?"" I know that he was seriously mistreated, and worse then that from what the restaurant manager implied it sounds like the restaurant may be knowingly targeting heroin users and/or ex-users, using them for a few months until they either get tired of the bullshit or relapse, and then firing them for a new round of the same.",legaladvice
Neighbor threatening to sue us for cutting down our own tree.,"Ohio

This January we had a giant oak tree cut down in our backyard. Prior to this happening we informed our neighbors as we had to have lots of trucks and a crane blocking the street and my driveway for short periods of time during the day they cut it down. No one said anything or seemed to really care. 

The tree was a huge hazard. All winter we had been experiencing small limbs falling and we were starting to get concerned for one falling onto our house. We did have the tree trimmed every other year. But one big limbs finally fell on our patio after an ice storm, crushing our furniture and patio awning. As soon as the weather allowed - we had the entire tree cut down. We discovered that the tree was actually very unhealthy. Most of the inside was decayed and there was a giant crack down the center of the base. Seriously a ticking time bomb. This definitely saved our house as well as our neighbors homes. 

Fast forward to the summertime, as our yards are coming into bloom and the heat is rising our AC bills. We did notice our electric bill was a little higher as we no longer have the usual shade of the tree. A small price to pay for our safety. 

Our next door neighbors have essentially a botanical garden in their backyard. They are retired and spend a lot of time working on their yard and landscaping. The tree branches had previously reached over a bit of their property, but more significantly provided a lot of shade over the house and yard. 

Apparently - now that their yard has gone from partial sun to full sun, a large amount of their flowers and shrubs were unable to thrive as usual. Their electric bill is also effected. 

Mr approached us a few times over the summer to tell us how selfish and rude we were to not consider how this would effect their yard now that there is significantly more sun. Their house is also featured on our townships garden club annual tour and they decided they could not participate this year due to the ""significant losses.""

Another neighbor (a much more reasonable one) said that he had approached them and asked if they would be interested in ""teaming up"" to sue for costs of lost landscaping and electric bills due to us cutting down the tree. He said no and then told us - just in case they decide to actually sue us. 

I realize this sounds completely insane. I can guarantee that the entire base and roots of the tree were on our property (no question - it was smack in the center of our yard). All that touched their property was the afternoon shade the tree provided and a few feet of branches.

We did inform them of this happening right at the beginning - I don't believe this is our fault that we prefer to spare our house and lives over their landscaping. In fact we probably spared their own home by cutting this tree down - if it fell in their direction it would have definitely hit their house too. 

Is there any possible leg for them to stand on?

EDIT:
Wow this blew up way more than anticipated! To answer the most asked questions - the tree removal company did acquire the township permits prior to removing the tree. We do not have to replace the tree - there are several other trees further back on our property.

We aren't really friendly with these neighbors - they are always looking to complain about everyone. A dog barks too loud, not cutting the grass often enough, another neighbor had their driveway re-paved that was not to their liking, once we had a party with about a dozen people and they called the cops because we parked on the street in front of their house (100% legal street parking). Everything anyone does makes their life more unpleasant. 

We will just continue our lives and if we are served we will respond. I did call the tree company just to confirm any documentation they have for cutting down the tree and they still have it and said they were more than willing to assist us if there was a problem.

So yeah that's fucking insane and terrifying and yeah I was really glad I didn't hear that over the phone.

So - here's the thing. The tumor is confirmed definitely 100% *not* the reason he hallucinated Steve The Dog and why I'm not calling it a real twist (sorry). It was too small and not in the right place - he didn't have *any* symptoms from it, not even headaches. 

So basically the tumor was a huge coincidence, which totally blows my mind and I can't stop thinking about it even months later. Because if he *hadn't* had those hallucinations then he wouldn't have had the MRI so soon and it wouldn't have been caught so early and then who knows what would have happened to him right? Scary shit. Get checked out regularly, guys. 

Oh also it wasn't cancerous but it would have still been dangerous unchecked. They were able to totally remove it though because of how early it was caught so yeah, really lucky. Thanks for looking out Steve. You're a good boy. 

I know people want to know what actually caused the hallucinations but I really don't know. I think I mentioned before that I'm not asking for specific details (not my business). Sorry guys but I'd feel like shit if I was him and I didn't have the option to tell people really personal shit like that myself. I'm sure he'll tell me when he's ready. 

Anyway gonna start wrapping this up (thanks for sticking with me), but I actually stayed in CA for a while so I can definitely say that after brain surgery, therapy, lots of meds, and everything else he's doing great - you know, all things considered. Still dunno when he's coming home but I don't think it should be too much longer. 

I got to visit him a lot when I was out there though, which was awesome because it was proof he was really *okay*, you know? At first he didn't want to see me because he was kinda embarrassed I think, but I was like stfu it's not like you don't have shit on me too and he got over it. He's also on board with getting a real Steve, so I've started looking for the perfect dog for him to come home to. Or maybe I'll wait for him. I dunno. Still deciding.  

So I guess that's it. Thanks again for all the great advice, help, and support through this crazy ride. If this makes it to BOLA I'll see you there. ",legaladvice
"Out of town for business, my rental car was flagged as stolen weeks before I rented it resulting in a felony traffic stop involving 8 officers.","I'm in San Francisco for work, and my wife flew out this weekend so we could visit Napa. On the way there, we noticed an officer following us, and as soon as we got off our exit we were pulled over. Three other squad cars blocked the off ramp and pulled their guns on us. They asked me to put our hands in the air, throw the keys out of the window, walk backwards, get on my knees, etc. they did the same with my wife and when we asked why this was happening they didn't answer. 

They put me in the back of the squad car, and read my rights to me. They then told me the car was stolen, to which I responded it was a rental. After some time they confirmed the paper work with the rental company, and cleared the plates. They explained that the company reported it stolen weeks ago when it wasn't returned on time, then never followed up with the police department. The officers explained that the city we were in has one of the highest crime rates in America which was why they had to take it as seriously as they did. We later confirmed that with locals as well as the good old internet. 

We've talked to multiple people who believe we should sue the rental company, because at the end of the day the officers were acting on the information they had and we were the wrong flinch away from being shot. Would there actually be a case here?",legaladvice
My sister is stealing my 2 yo nephew (who I have raised since birth) for food stamps,"My sister has been addicted to drugs for most of my adult life. She got pregnant when she was 19, around the same time that I got pregnant with my son. I had a miscarriage, and my sister had her baby. My sister was not ready to be a mom, so she gave her baby to me to raise as my own. 

He sees me as his mother, and my husband as his father. I buy his clothes, food, toys, take him to Chuck E. Cheese's on Fridays, he sleeps in our bed, he is my son. He is two years old. 

My guardianship expired this May, but I did not receive the notice because I moved houses. A few weeks ago, my sister came and took my ""son"" from my house and told me I was not allowed to contact them. 

She is doing this because she wants more food stamps for her and her current boyfriend, who she is now living with. We all live in Arizona.

Employer approved my Paid time off. When I was on my vacation they went back and denied and lost out on 3 weeks of pay....,"[MN]I got hired at a new job in February.  One of the conditions upon me excepting a position was that I get PTO for a 3 week backpacking trip that I had planned for a year. They agreed. 
Put in my formal request online for May 13th-May 31 on March 18th. It was approved by the owner. 
Nothing was said after that about my trip. 
I left and came back and noticed I hadn't been paid at all while I was gone. 
I went back into my clock in app on my phone and found out he went back and denied it May 14th (day after I left) without saying a word.  After I got back to work nothing was said to me until I brought the issue up. 
Who would I talk to about this is there anything I can do? It put me in a huge financial pickle for a bit.

**edit*** 
I didn't expect these many responses. 

This was an odd situation relocating. They pretty much sought me out because of my experience. I knew I was getting a pay cut so I wanted some more incentive to move.  My other company was giving me PTO for 3 weeks. They knew this. So I asked for 3 weeks paid time off in order for me to move up here. Verbally they agreed on it. I myself thought it was weird but hey. They wanted me up here. 
I talked to HR today who is the owner's wife. We pulled up my contract and there it was. 

""Three weeks paid time off per year(one weeks to use from 6m to 1yr anniversary""

So on paper I messed up. I should've been more clear and had them write that in the contract. 
I know we verbally we agreed on it I made it clear.  There was no other reason why I would accept the position otherwise. The owner and his wife denied saying anything of the sort. 

I'm just upset that they let the approval go for over a month then go back and deny it the day after I left. 

This is my fault. Lesson learned.

My company went bankrupt and left 64 employees without their pay and ability to collect unemployment.,"Since July of this year, the company I was working for stopped doing direct deposits and started giving paper checks. They didn't have paystubs and upon many requests were never given any. Everyone lost access to view their benefits online. We were told it was temporary.  It was not. 

 Fast forward a couple months they closed seven locations with no warning. We started having none of our supply orders filled and could barely maintain our clinics. It was told that they were having financial issues and things would improve. With the closures. 

 Then everyones 401k contributions stopped, even though they were still taken from paychecks. We were told it was temporary and they would be returned. By this time a lot of people left, those that had contributed thousands to their 401k. I fortunately never had one.

I worked 114 hours before all of the locations closed. My manager called me crying. She told me to send a demand for payment and file a complaint for wage theft, and get on unemployment. I did all of those but for unemployment they are saying they have no records of any of us working there. We are unsure if quarterly taxes were done. One employee was (almost?) arrested because his child payments weren't being made. 

It's made local news, and I heard from there that the state (CO) is investigating this, but all efforts to contact the owner has returned nothing. 

My questions are; Should I go to small claims court for my final paycheck? Does it cost me to do that? What do I do if my taxes were not being witheld and were instead being taken by the company?  And why can't they find proof for any of us that we worked there?",legaladvice

My mom keeps telling people I'm a lawyer when I'm not. Worried about liability or potential character and fitness issues (CA),"Hello everyone,

I'm currently a law student (2L) and my mom is really starting to make me worry.

She's a very verbally aggressive and entitled person. Anytime something doesn't go her way, she immediately starts screaming law suit when 100% of the time she's at fault or doesn't have a claim anyways.

Recently, she took her cat to the vet to get vaccinated. A few days later, the cat was very sick and would scream if carried. My mother took the cat to the vet, but informed them she was refusing to pay for the visit or any tests because she just knew it was their vaccine that made the cat sick and therefore the office was at fault and should eat the cost. 

Understandably, they said no. My mother announced she was going to sue them, that it was unconstitutional for them to deny her cat free care (I don't even), and that I, her child, was an attorney and was going to sue them for everything they had. She left them my information. 

I got a call from the vet's attorney who wanted to talk about the matter. I immediately interrupted them and let them know that (1) I was not an attorney, (2) I never agreed to represent my mother in the matter, (3) I could not legally represent my mother in the matter, and (4) I was terribly sorry about this. I explained how my mother did this all the time. The attorney understood and let me go.

While nothing bad came out of it, I'm worried someone will report me to C&F for unauthorized practice of law if my mother keeps this up. I have repeatedly asked her to knock if off, but she just won't. She's also given her friends my information to get legal advice from me and I have to keep telling them that I can't help them. 

Can I get in any kind of trouble because of my mom's assertions that I'm an attorney? What can I legally do to protect myself? ",legaladvice

He wasn't happy with how little he got to see her (which was like 1x a month if that) and kept working overtime to pay for another court date. This time he was guaranteed 3x a week visit for an hour, and the whole of Sunday. She actually was allowing this but still being a bitch. Well he kept working and he and his lawyer took her to court again for custody. Yesterday after 6 hours in court he won primary custody and he picked his daughter up today.

AZ/NV just found out my wife was married as a 'joke' in Vegas in 1997,"I never thought I'd be posting here but I need some help on where to go from here. My wife and I are about to celebrate our 15th anniversary in a few weeks. Long ago when we first got together she told me she married one of her gay guy co-workers in Vegas as a joke when she was a teen. Honestly, I thought she was full of it and that it probably wasn't anything legal anyway. 

Well, now I read another post on LA about a guy who might have gotten married to a stranger in Vegas. Someone on his post added a link to the Clark County marriage record search. I put her name in and holy shit if a certificate didn't pop up. She is sitting next to me ready to puke. She didn't think it was a legal marriage either.

So now what?  She didn't even really know the guy. Has no idea what happened to him. She is frantically searching Google and Facebook for him with no luck. 

So I guess our marriage is invalid?  We have two kids!  What does this mean. Were they adopted fraudulently because our marriage certificate is invalid?  I will get an attorney tomorrow but would like to know what to expect. 

1. What if we can't find this guy?
2. What if we do?
3. How much shit are we in for: filing taxes together, getting our names changed, adopting our kids under the pretense that we were married?
4. Best case scenario- quickie paper divorce, right?  And then what, do we have to get remarried?

Website refuses to take down the ad for seasonal renting of our squated house,"So, this is a bit muddy because the website is international (and very popular, starts with a B), the house is in France, the owners (us) are French but the house is squated by UK citizens.

Namely, my husband's family, who we let in the house graciously. After a few years, because of bad blood we asked to get our house back, they refused. Here again we are rather in the dark, we are communicating through lawyers but it has been on a stand by since June, I think our lawyer is crap but that's another matter.

We originally bought this house to rent it to tourists but never got a chance (the family moved in the moment we bought it).

Now, they were legally asked to leave by the 1st of June (I have shown the paper to the website). Obivously they didn't, but on top of that, they have been renting rooms to tourists since March.

I contacted the website, provided them with proofs of ownership etc, expressed my desire to see the illegal renting stop. I called several times, sent several mails, starting April. While it was momentarily made unavailable, the renting has continued and still is going on.

Last time I called, the guy told me that it was up to their law service, he couldn't say/do anything. I threatened to go to the police, he encouraged me to do so. Unfortunately, the police won't do anything, I have to go to the tribunal and ... pay a lot of money that I don't have.

I then appealed to the law that says I can ask for my personnal data to be taken off a website, as there are pictures of our house, exact location etc... same thing, temporary disabled then back on the website, no answer.

From what I understand, the squaters have bought another house and are making the most of our house to make profit during summer before hopefully leaving, but at that rate i'm wondering if they are ever gonna leave if they can rent it for the whole year. I would really want to see it shut down.

Do you have any idea what I can do?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT : Sorry to the mods, I think I inadvertantly gave you a lot of work!

To answer some suggestions, it is illegal for me to change the locks, add locks, block them in anyway. Even though they are illegal in the house. Welcome to France... They also ""only"" rent rooms in the house, while still living in it, so I can't rent it and take over. I still have the keys, my husband went to get some of our stuff at some point and was verbally and almost physically attacked (my family buffered), insulted, they called a friend to block the car and so on... the extent of the bad blood is going quite far now. 

I definetely get your point about the lawyer, we are going on holidays for 4 days, if when we come back nothing has changed I will get a new lawyer. This is ridiculous. I'm litterally wondering if my lawyer has been bribed or something... 

Between the website not complying, my lawyer who is crap and these people who litterally pushed my husband to suicide and then refused to help the search party, I am utterly disgusted and hoping they get all lost very, very far...

I told her on my bike ride. She responded with:

Not up to me (Other Boss) told me you are termed You will need to talk to him

My response: 

Absolutely. I will find him and figure this out. 

I'm just letting you know that I am refuting absolutely any claim that I have or had any intentions of quitting. 

Thanks for letting me know

She responded with: 

Play nice

She won't budge beyond that. She's a professional CYA adherent. Now I'm getting ready to go find him and point out that I am not quitting.

He knows that I am not quitting. Barring mental illness, or chemical influence, he is aware I have not quit.

I've never dealt with an executive manager specifically angry with me to any level really. He clearly wants me gone and I'm blindsided by his actions. Up until this morning I had been working on a proposal to the CEO that would create long term employment opportunities for myself with the company.☹️☹️


Edit 3:  Decided to email HR outlining the issue and requesting assistance. I'm not allowed on the work site until my supervisor is updated on my employment status. I'm taking this time to write a timeline of events leading up to this mornings message. I am also collecting any evidence of my intent to work today. 

I actually messaged several managers yesterday evening with instructions for the change over and offers to assist in any way.  I'm feeling pretty solid about the fact I haven't quit and not very solid at all on my future with the company. It just seems so petty and vindictive. This person is well known in our industry and is very qualified on paper. It just doesn't make sense to me. 

Edit 4: I'm calling HR and hoping I'm allowed to work! I'm afraid that it's not over and that he will try to prove I quit, despite all evidence to the contrary. Wish me luck!

Edit 5: Wow, I was so caught up in my own drama that I didn't realize how big this post had become. I'll do a quick update now and write up a more in-depth response when I have time.
Here's my update:

I have a job!!!

I'm actually writing this from my new office. The male boss, who claimed I quit, relented and allowed the transfer. I saw the CEO very briefly yesterday and thanked him for his assistance in everything and he said ""you shouldn't have to thank me for being allowed to do your job"". 

I'm so happy to be back where I belong. The first day I had a warm welcome back and it feels good to be doing what I'm supposed to do. Thanks to everyone for their input and advice.

[Texas] School sent a letter that our atheist student club will not be permitted this school year. Invited us to join Christian clubs instead.,"I'm 16 years old. In the last couple of years me and a friend founded an atheist student club in our school to provide a non-religious alternative to the Christian clubs that already existed. Last year we had 22 members. We are the only specifically non-religious club. This is a public school.

The letter says that the club is banned from the school in the coming school year due to the complaints from the parents that the club is encouraging lifestyle that they find unacceptable for their children. We do not bully or troll people. We just do what other clubs do without being religious. We accept all people and have no condition on atheism. Last year we had a Muslim and a Pagan student and everyone loves it.

The complaints are from the parents who don't like that their kids are not as religious as they are. We had a few members whose parents were very religious but they were not. Last year they complained but school took our side. I guess this year they gave in.

I went to the school today and talked to the assistant principal who said that they can't ignore complaints from parents and told me to forget about this.

I'm not a lawyer but doesn't the first amendment protect our right to freedom of and from religion? I don't think they can just say they can ban us because some parents don't like the atheist lifestyle.

First is the law on our side? And if so what resources I can use to fight the school's decision? My parents will not pay for a lawyer. ",legaladvice

Fired for anti china/pro HK comments on social media.,"Location: New Jersey (USA)

[UPDATE] [CA] How can I get my neighbors to get rid of their noisy chickens?,"I posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3brffg/ca_how_can_i_get_my_neighbors_to_get_rid_of_their/) about three years ago, and it got very little attention, but some people did help and for that I was (and am) super grateful. Plus, I figured we all like update posts, and this situation of chicken warfare is finally resolved. 

&#x200B;

To recap: my neighbors had five chickens that would squawk at ungodly hours of the morning and night. They were actually my parents neighbors; I was crashing with them over the summer and have since moved out. We did contact the city, who came and determined that they were up to code. But the neighbors assumed it was us (my parents had been pretty vocal in the neighborhood about not liking the chickens), and they decided to retaliate. 

&#x200B;

First, they claimed that a structure on my parents' property was illegal, and my parents had to deal with a city investigation, which turned up nothing, because it was not illegal. Next, they claimed that our little patch of sidewalk front yard, which is right next to theirs, was actually infringing on their property and demanded a property survey. We actually discovered that their front garden was partially on OUR land, so that was nice. My mother e-mailed the neighbors letting them know they were going to put up a little line of stones just to keep the garden property line clear so that they could plant their side, and the neighbors went batshit. Started sending long, rambling e-mails to my parents, started calling and hanging up, started throwing trash on our side of the garden and they eventually left several dead rodents still in traps on our front porch. After that, my parents got a security camera. 

&#x200B;

Things quieted down for a while, and we soon found out it was because the neighbors were trying to sell the house. Their house is pretty nice, and we live in a high COL city in a neighborhood that has really gotten popular in the past \~10 years. Basically, if all went well the neighbors would be making 2 or 3 million dollars from the sale. They hosted several open houses, and this is where my dad decided to get petty. See, my parents deck directly faced the neighbor's backyard, which still had the chicken coop and was one of the main attractions of the open house (they were actually trying to sell it as an ""urban farmhouse.""). As people would wander into the backyard of the open house, my dad would stand on his deck holding a very large sign that said, ""NO CHICKENS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD."" The other side said, ""THEY BRING RATS AND VERMIN INTO OUR LOVELY COMMUNITY."" I was half horrified, half cracking up. I told him that it would only escalate things, but he was insistent that any new neighbors not be allowed to keep the chickens. He would periodically shout down into the neighbors yard (our houses were very close), ""we will NOT allow new neighbors to keep chickens!""

&#x200B;

My parents got many furious calls and e-mails from the realtor and the neighbors. Apparently my dad was making people hesitant to buy the home (I don't blame them, he was acting like a crazy person), offers were dwindling, and they were going to have to lower the price. My dad said he would stop his chicken protest if the coop was removed; the chickens stayed, so my dad stayed on his deck for every single open house. 

&#x200B;

To make a long story of chicken subterfuge short, the neighbors sold the house. On their last night in the house, they egged my parents entire backyard and deck. I asked my dad if he wanted to report it, and he said it would be better to be rid of them. A lovely family has since moved in, and the first thing they did was dismantle the coop.

MIL started slapping me around the back of the head, shoulders and back.

Wife came in and almost had to carry MIL out of the room. I'm in a state of shock, I have to calm our son down and finish cleaning him. Can hear MIL and FIL raging in the background. Hear the front door slam.

MIL now says she's calling CPS and has reported the ""sexual abuse"" of our son.

What's my recourse here? When CPS show up, do I bar them from entering and explain the waste of time they're in for? Do I let them in? Do I hire a lawyer and look for a cease and desist?

I'm worried about letting CPS in because people have told me that they will take a dim view of me (the father) being the one looking after him while my wife is working. Is there any truth to that?

I'm fairly certain she will call CPS because she has called the police on me in the past for driving my wife's car.

[UPDATE] Wife got married as a joke in Vegas in 1997,"Quick update to my original post https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/as5sqf/aznv_just_found_out_my_wife_was_married_as_a_joke/

We just finished up with our initial meeting with the attorney. We all agree that we are going to try to get an annulment. The guy has such a common name that it's going to be close to impossible to find him. They will do a search, followed by a publication. Then the petition for annulment will be filed. 

Annulment is best case scenario because it will be like it never happened and we can go about our lives.   He thinks she has a good chance of it being approved since they never lived together, filed taxes together or even consummated the marriage. 

The tricky thing is if the judge doesn't approve the annulment. Because of our marriage, adoption of our kids, tax filings, etc., we might be in for a world of shit if she has to file for divorce. Let's hope it doesn't come to that. 

I'll update again when it's over!",legaladvice
My sister falsely reported myself and my daughter missing and it created a media stir up and a lot of visits from detectives and CBS workers in the domestic violence shelter I was staying in to keep safe from her. (MO),"After leaving my abusive ex boyfriend with my infant daughter, I went to stay with my mother and sister to recover from the horrific emotional and physical trauma we survived for nearly five years. I thought it would be healthy and helpful for us to be around some family who cared and wanted to see us heal from his abuse. 

Keep in mind I had not resided with my mom or sister for over a decade. I'd only made breif visits to my hometown every once and a while. This was fully moved in and no going back. 

I started becoming uncomfortable with some of the behaviors and especially with the way my sister was hitting her daughter with a belt to discipline her. I could not let my daughter see that for fear it could harm her in some way. My mom and sister are very enmeshed both have never lived alone once and are very codependent with one another. There was a lot of drama and zero respect for boundaries, my belongings were being stolen by the kids and were even told by their parents to take money from my purse at one point. I decided it was time to leave as soon as possible. 

After i left I started noticing that my phone was acting strangly. My data kept going over and the battery was always almost too hot to touch. I ended up taking it into an apple store and one of the techs said there had been Spyware installed and a keylogger. He also said that it can't be done remotely so to think of who knows my password. My sister and her kids are the only people. 

The next day I was followed for three hours and at one point I had to flag down the police so that I could tell them what was going on and they helped me get into a domestic violence shelter. At this time I was still talking with my sister as she was pretending to be a sympathetic ear to get info. I told her the name of the town the shelter was in and it wasn't soon after that I told her about the Spyware that had been found on my phone. Her reaction was strange (calling me paranoid and delusional) so strange that I got rid of my phone as fast as possible and had a police escort to the shelter that evening. 

Not soon after that I found out she had filed a missing persons report and tried to have an amber alert issued for my daughter. She had over 12 jurisdictions working to find me because of the lies she had told them. It was everywhere and I couldn't go to the store without someone calling 911. It got to social media and eventually one of the residents inside the shelter started communicating with my sister. I'm not sure what was said but the director was able to see the computer activity. 

The next day CPS came to the shelter door. I don't know how they knew for sure that I was ther, but I'll make an educated guess it was because of the correspondence between the shelter resident and my sister. My sister is an LPN and she tried to use her mandated reporter status to make it more convincing. She was also accessing our medical records to get our location. 

I met with the detective from CPS that same day and it was flagged as unfounded and closed. She said that they see this situation all of the time and that it's usually the person calling who should be investigated. 

Now any time anyone Googles my name or my daughters this whole thing comes up and it paints me as this unhinged, mentally unstable and unfit mother all because of what my sister fabricated. I'll never find a job in my state and I'm considering moving away. 

This has to be illegal or at least something could be done through a civil lawsuit? 

What can I do?
.
Edit: CPS not CBS I'm title.

Also, I still don't understand why she is doing this to my daughter and I. I can't think of any reason other than pure enjoyment and possibly some type of personality disorder.

I also forgot to add that she had taken pictures of my car and license tag weeks before this all unfolded. A detective was able to see when and where each photo was taken. ",legaladvice
[Update] Delinquent Child Support Case,"The TL;DR is my father is a truck driver, moved around a lot, and switched jobs whenever child support caught up with him. He saw my brother and I about two days a year, much less than the two days per week the child support was based on. He ended up owing $90,000 + interest for delinquent payments, which ended up at around $450,000. He was set to inherit a lot of money from my grandmother, paid $2,000 monthly so he wouldn't blow it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/84i2i4/ca_delinquent_child_support_case/

------------------------------------------

Court dropped the initial amount owed due to a court filing error during the divorce, which made my parents legally married for about a year and a half after they had submitted divorce paperwork (CA courts say 'oops!') Final agreed upon amount was ~$390,000. My father disputed this amount, but never submitted any evidence (because there was none) so that amount was final.

2nd court case today for the inheritance money, where my mother was made a plaintiff. Father tried to claim he worked for my grandfather, and my grandfather paid the child support for him (neither of those are true) but I guess he forgot (lol) to mention that during the Child Support case, and the judge didn't want to hear it. Also claimed he has a great relationship with both of his sons (I stopped talking to him when I was 13, which is more than half my life ago, and my brother doesn't really know him so well since he was gone basically my brother's entire life.)

Judge ruled totally in favor of my mother, so the $190,000 my father was set to inherit is being given directly to my mother. Judge also ruled my father has to continue paying $700 a month, which is what the previous Child Support hearing had determined due to the $2,000 monthly payments he was originally supposed to receive in inheritance money. 

The best part is my father tried to settle out of court for $25,000.

---------------------------------------------------

My mother is elated. My father has been mocking her for years over this, telling her she would never get her money. My mother never spent any money on herself, and instead tried to make sure my brother and I didn't miss out on anything because we had just one parent around. She has almost nothing for retirement now, since she had to take out of her 401k a lot and since she got laid off 6 months before she was eligible for retirement.

This is pretty much the best thing that has happened to my family in quite some time. I don't live by my mom, but will be sending my brother some money to buy a nice bottle of champagne.

"[Final Update] During our last visit my step-daughter informed us she was being sexually abused at home, please help.","After a string of bad news I have finally gained the ability to bring a positive update to the sub.

From the time we discovered my wife's ex had absconded with the children, we documented every action we took while we found a lawyer who then informed us we would need to retain two lawyers themselves and one where the children were now located which we had confirmed to be New Brunswick.

After retaining both lawyers we got in front of a judge, and we won! We now have full custody of all the children, he can only file any further actions by coming to Alberta to do so and we have full control of access to the children whom he can't remove from the province, if he wants to see them he has to come here. We are so happy and I just wanted to finally share good news with you all as your help and support has been absolutely wonderful! Thanks LA!

"Car delivery service left my vehicle flipped on its SIDE blocking an entire lane of a major boulevard, marked it as ""delivered"" and left with my money before police could arrive","Hey everyone, first time posting here. A few people advised that I turn to this community since my claim with the BBB is taking a while to resolve.

I am an automotive enthusiast. I have been working with my dad on project cars for over a decade. I recently saved up enough money and purchased a ""non-operational"" 1967 Cadillac Coupe DeVille (me & my dad's dream car). I wanted to check it out and surprise him with it once I got it up & running. The owner gave me a good deal as long as I tow it from Alabama and do an inspection when it arrives in GA (it was about 2.5 hrs away).

Company fails to call me upon pick-up. The seller's neighbors noticed the truck hauling the vehicle and texted him pics that he forwarded to me. This was at 7AM. He notifies me, so I immediately call the carrier to confirm if they picked it up and when I can expect them to show up (it's a weekday so I needed to make sure I'm available). The carrier never picks up, I've been sitting around all morning & afternoon postponing my work, errands, and entire day because I don't want him to show up without me being present. Just trying to get a vague idea of when to be on-site and ready to help.

After trying to reach several numbers 10-12 times, the 3rd party dispatcher finally made the carrier (towing company) driver call me back. It was around 7PM (entire day has passed) and tells me he'll be here in a few hours. My whole schedule has been dissolved at this point, but i figure ""FINE"" as long as they get here.

Fast forward a few hours. Truck arrives, the main driver is very irritable, annoyed, treating and talking to me like it's my fault that it's dark & late after I've been waiting for him a full day without notice. Turns out, him & his partner can not remove the car off the rails because they secured it in the wrong place. I was outside trying to offer them help for hours, calming the situation, consolidating, offering water & trying to strategize. I know as a client I don't ""have"" to, but it was a signature moment for me in buying this car, and I wanted to get it here safely. It was obvious that they were extremely incompetent but I gave them benefit of the doubt.

I went inside and let them do their work without bothering them. At this point it's 2AM and the car hasn't moved. They were fed up, so one of them proceeded to push the car. He applied too much sideways force (to an already non-operational vehicle) and made it slip off the truck railing. At this point the car is sitting on ONE rail, whole weight on its oil pan which eventually cracks oil starts pouring out.

I run outside. Immediately tell them to stop! Like what are you doing?? I even said ""Would you let this happen to a Ferrari??""

The driver tells me ""I can't help you any further, get this car off my damn truck cause I gotta leave. If I have to, I'll sell it in Alabama it to recoup the time I've lost here""

I was shocked & appalled. Threatening to leave with my private property after HE knowingly picked up a non-operational vehicle and couldn't fulfill delivery (damaging my property in the process) even though the contract is ""Door to Door delivery"" ""No risk guarantee, Fully insured etc. all the shits & giggles.""

He gets in the truck and is about to leave. Keep in mind I already paid $150 deposit to the 3rd party company that assigns the load location and carrier who wants to fulfill the shipment. I also had to give the driver $200 cash once he arrived before ""attempting"" to unload my car. I run up to him and say ""You can't leave with my property. Stop right now!""

He proceeds to tell me I have to call a local Atlanta 24/7 emergency line to come assess the situation because otherwise he's leaving with my car within an hour.

I call the first number that comes up on Google and let him speak to the company. He hands me the phone back and says ""we're good, I'll wait"" At this point I'm done with this guy, so I go inside and let him do his thing. An hour later I see the local emergency service guy arrive. I stay inside & watch. I figure I'd just let them talk, assess the situation and finish everything while I wait for further notice.

Fast forward 30 minutes, I run outside to check up on everything see [MY CAR FLIPPED ON ITS SIDE LIKE WTF??](https://imgur.com/a/FRRM0). Blocking an entire lane of traffic on a major downtown boulevard. Broken roof, cracked oil pan, doors, mirrors, wheels, everything.

Before I can even ask for my money back, since the car was technically never ""delivered"", the trucker storms off EVEN before police could arrive. Leaving the scene of a crime, or at minimum damaged property that he's liable to deliver safely. I had to spend another few hundred $$ on the tow truck service that the local PD called in order to get the car off it's side since it was impeding traffic. I filed a police report + 2 witnesses.

The cops were very helpful and sympathetic. We spent hours discussing the situation while they helped me get it on my property. At a certain point we all started laughing on [HOW RIDICULOUS THIS IS](https://imgur.com/a/FRRM0). They said they've never seen anything like this before. It was almost 8AM at this point, I thanked the officers, at this point we all wanted to just go home & get some rest. I filed a complaint with the BBB the next morning.

It's just sad to me that people have to treat other humans this way. I don't owe you anything, I don't need to oversee or micromanage your incompetence. It's not my job to do so. I went through all this time to save up, research, and buy something special for my dad while trying to do something good. I didn't even have to be present. Door to door delivery implies the drivers know what they are doing. I would have never imagined being treated like this, let alone if this was someone else like an elderly person who wouldn't be able to talk or deal with these guys' attitude at all. All I wanted was to get my property in ONE piece. I didn't have to endure this type of treatment.

Anyways the officers told me this is a civil matter. I don't have a budget for an attorney, but local paralegal friends of mine told me this is a pretty solid case so I should seek some feedback. I wanted to turn to you guys for advice & see what I can do.

Sorry for the long post/formatting. Hopefully I can find some guidance.

Thank you!",legaladvice
Update: A girl I knew from high school is accusing me of sexual assault.,"I followed the advice given to me here, and I spoke to an attorney that drafted an official letter to send her to cease and desist. She did nothing, and doubled down on me being a ""rapist"". 

Somehow she contacted my workplace, and got me fired. My wife has left me, and took our children. She is afraid of what ""I might be capable of"", all our years of marriage be damned. Times this Christmas were very dark...

Fortunately, my attorney called me days ago to inform that he will proceed with ""step 2"", and push a lawsuit against her. Like someone stated in my past post, Washington's laws might help make a victory possible. I'm hoping something will come of this. I don't want her to get away with this.

Update: Dying of a mysterious lung disease.,"TLDR: I'm finally getting help.

Since my last post, I've talked to several people who were extremely helpful to my situation to include the upper CoC of medical, the senator, some lawyers, the state's Department of Health and the EPA. I figured ""fuck it, if I'm dying I have nothing to really lose"" and threw a hail Mary.

The doctors still have no clue yet what it may be, but the next round of testing for parasites, autoimmune diseases and independent mold inspections for my housing situation has commenced.

I was reassigned to a new PCM who was previously an internal medicine specialist so they had a foot in the door to get me looked at and actually took the time to collect a list of ***ALL*** my issues then started treating/evaluating me for them. They aren't fatal (which is why they've gone neglected, Navy medicine is very reactionary) but my quality of life will improve considerably.

I am my mother's only child (son). I am in charge of her estate, but I am 22 years old and really have no idea how to handle any of this. She stated in her letter to me that everything she has goes to me. No will though. She was divorced and single I am proceeding with probate, although, very slowly because I was so confused and hurt by all of this for quite some time.

My aunt recently sent me an email with one sentence, saying: ""call 123-123-1234 Blah blah Law Office. You're going to court!"" I was advised not to engage with her at all and speak with my probate lawyer first. What could she possibly be trying to do?

Maybe I sound confident and calm now, but in reality, my aunt and grandmother have shocked and hurt me and my father soooo very much by their actions recently, and the thought of dealing with her makes me feel nauseous. Please feel free to ask for more info if this seems too vague. Thank you for any help.

"UPDATE: Company car I was driving was hit by a drunk driver. Insurance fully paid for the car but the company says I still owe them $40,000 [CA]","Original post [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3hwt4a/company_car_i_was_driving_was_hit_by_a_drunk/) The tl;dr version is that I was almost killed by a drunk driver while I was driving a company car. His insurance paid the blue book value ($40,000) to the company but I was sent to collections and told that I owed them $40,000 for the car because I didn't return it to them in the condition which they gave it to me. 

No one at the company or the collections agency would help me and they just sent me back and forth (company told me to talk to collections, collections told me to talk to the company) so I ended up getting a lawyer because the stress of being hounded by collections was setting back my recovery.

The lawyer sent a very strongly worded letter to someone high up that I couldn't reach myself because I kept getting the run around. That person didn't know anything about it and the company launched an investigation. The three people who kept giving me the run around ended up being charged with fraud and a bunch of other stuff. I don't know much but the police say they have emails and they think the 3 were planning on keeping the payment for themselves since the company was already paid. They are also in trouble for fraudulently using company resources to send me to collections for a fake debt.

Afterward my company wrote me a letter of apology. They paid the costs for my lawyer and made sure the debt was removed from my record. They also made a donation to a charity of my choice. I am nearly ready to return to work but they told me to take as much time as I need. After talking with the police I believe the higher ups were not aware because the police say the 3 were trying to keep it a secret. The drunk driver's insurance is paying all my bills related to the incident so I won't have debt from this ever.

All in all I am doing much better. I would like to thank /r/legaladvice and everyone who offered advice and encouragement and sent me supportive messages. You were all so helpful and I appreciate it :)",legaladvice
"Work forcing me to use my mobile data for this new app they installed, threatening my job.","Ive been working for a security company, for the last 4 years. Two weeks ago they drop this new app they licenced without telling anybody and tells me ""it's a new policy, it's required, yadada, if you don't we'll find someone else."" 

The app requires location services, bluetooth, storage permissions, camera & flash. It uses a qr sticker for all the different check points for patrols and what not, which suck for obvious reasons. The worst contender is how much data it uses, during one shift is uses 100mb of data. That's easily a tenth of a lot of peoples monthly data and the extra use charges are criminally expensive and I'm not paid enough to afford anything more.
So I have been turning my data off during my work shifts and sending all the reports in when I'm at home on wifi, which I figure is completely reasonable since I don't want a more expensive phone bill because of my job.

No, I have their gate keeper come and scream at me. He basically holds me verbally hostage saying that I'm refusing to do my job and threatening to fire me once a shift now while refusing to listen to my reasoning or my attempts to find a way to make it work out for everyone involved.

This has mostly been a rant so TLDR: my employeers made a sudden decision to force everyone onto an app that uses way too much data and provides no compensation for using personal resources.

I know California and Illinois have laws that force buisnesses to compensate for personal expenses but I can't find anything for ~mystate~

 Edit: deleted some stuff.
 I got an answer from the company. Basically I'm not the only one who's been complaining about the data usage so they plan to install phones and they don't have a problem with my method for now. The guy who was telling me all this stuff was just having a power trip it seems.

HELP- my autistic son's behavioral therapist called CPS over turmeric. Not kidding.,"EDIT: thank you all so much for your feedback. The irony in all of this is that I am a mandated reporter as well which, in a sense, has made me more concerned. Alas, I'm trudging forward with abandon and will be kind and cooperative. I'll be sure to post updates. 


I am in California. I need help and I'm hoping that some of you may have some insight. 
My autistic  6 year old has been with the same ABA (behavioral therapy) company for 4 years and we love them. Several weeks ago, we got a new behavioral therapist who is with my son 4 days a week, 2 of them at our home. I have not been happy with her as she rubbed me the wrong way from the start: harsher that necessary with my son and overall cold and calloused. I spoke to our BCBA (supervisor) and she said the therapist was brand new to the company and that they'd give her further training. 

Today, I get a phone call from our BCBA who tells me that CPS was called over a concern that there was a bottle of supplements (turmeric, to be specific) on the counter that my son allegedly picked up and it concerned her. The therapist never said anything to me about this.  Our BCBA then says that she herself has been to our home many times and is here to back me up in anyway needed and that she has never been concerned about anything in our home. 

Questions: 

1. should I obtain legal council or just move forward and willingly work with CPS knowing that there is no case?  My thought is that this is something frivolous and clearly not neglect, but I honestly have no idea what to expect with this process and want to do what's best for my family. 

2. If I do decide to move forward sans attorney, do I allow them in when they visit? 

3. How much (or little) information do I give during the home visit? 

Any feedback would be much appreciated. This is brand new territory for me and, quite frankly, I'm terrified even though I know that I'm a damn good special needs mother.

Seeing as the last post I made got popular thought I would come back and give an update. As much as I wish this ended dramatically with SD getting arrested or embarrassed in court i'm sad to say this isn't the case. 

So after I sent SD the text telling her to stop contacting me she began to blow my phone up with voice mails and texts. I saved them all obviously and forwarded them to my fathers attorney. The day after I made my first post my attorney had a letter sent to SD. Won't post the letter here but i'll paraphrase to the best of my ability while trying to interpret all the legal talk

""If you believe your child's claim to my clients estate is legitimate please submit to a DNA test as your earliest convenience. If an independent DNA test confirms your claims of my clients paternity to your child we will see to having him compensated as according to local laws for the requested child support. On the claim of getting a potion of the estate, my client specified in his will that his estate would be left to his children FakeFather21 and Sister. Unless you are able to provide the letter of recognition as you stated in my office on the 22nd we will consider that your child was either disowned or unacknowledged by my client and will proceed as such. If you are unable to provide the claimed letter I advise you seek legal council of your own. 

On the topic of you continued contact with my clients benefactors I suggest you cease it immediately. They have made it clear that they do not wish to associate with you outside of legal dealings. If you continue to contact them I have recommended they take legal action against you""

The best part has to be how he ended it however

""If there is the possibility that your claims of my clients paternity to your child are misinformed or fraudulent I suggest you admit to this and cease contact with me and my clients. If you continue these action under false claims not only will you be receiving a bill for my time, I will suggest that my clients take legal action against you.""

While this was going on my sister tracked down SB's parents and got into contact with them. It turns out that SB has not had contact with her parents in multiple years, but that is not the important part. Apparently this is not the first time she has done this. Apparently she pulled the same stunt with another man when this kid was born 9 years ago and got paid off to leave him alone. I also forwarded this to my attorney

So fast forward to this morning when I get a call from my attorney. SB is retracting her statements claiming she ""misunderstood"" the situation and no longer believes her son is my fathers kid.

So yeah, no big dramatic ending sadly but I guess this is over. Thanks for the advice originally. I know some people were asking why I came here when I already had an attorney, and to be honest I see where you guys are coming from. I was pretty stressed and with this woman trying to steal what my father had worked his whole life for I really just needed a place to vent and look for advice on what I should do. Thanks for that.

"(Kentucky) Teacher mentioned my brother by name, said smoking pot resulted in him getting addicted to drugs and eventually commit suicide.

Really sucks for me because I'm expected to follow in his footsteps and always fall short.

Aaand my brother is alive and well. Talked to him just 2 hours ago. He never smoked pot, never had drug addiction and most importantly never committed suicide!

Vice principal said I can't prove that he was speaking about my brother, it's possible he was speaking about someone else. This is such nonsense, the teacher was so detailed and he even dropped his first name once. It's more than obvious he was talking about my brother.

What can I do about my WEIRDO landlord?,"Hi! Not planning to take legal action here yet but I lurk on this Reddit sometimes and I am definitely curious about something! Location: USA, Pennsylvania

I just moved into a great new apartment last month. It's a house where the downstairs is my own apartment and the upstairs is the landlord's apartment. One important thing to know is that my kitchen is detached from my other rooms. I have to go through a common hallway to reach my kitchen, but it is MY kitchen. Only problem with the place  is that the landlord has been doing some weird stuff that makes me uncomfortable. 

I was going to try to skip over the socially weird stuff that he does and keep it to the stuff that I think could be illegal. But he's very creepy. He comes down and knocks on my door often, just to be like ""What are you doing today?"" This has happened once or twice a week the past few weeks. Once he even called me. He was like ""I'm going to a party with some other property owners in the neighborhood, wanted to know if you would like to come too..."" which isn't that bad, but when I said no he started pressing me. He got kind of mad, started being like ""you know this is really disappointing to me, I thought maybe you'd want to support your new neighborhood etc"" I ended up hanging up on him. I don't want to be friends with my landlord. I hate the dynamic and he's also probably the same age as my grandparents. 

My apartment has three doors basically. But two of them are nailed shut and can't be used. It's an old house that was converted to be apartments. Last week he came down and knocked on the main door. I didn't want to talk so I didn't answer. So then...he goes down and knocks on the second and third doors really hard, knowing those can't be used. I stayed quiet and just didn't answer. Five minutes later I get an email. ""Just knocked on your door to see what you're up to. Thought I heard you down there but I guess not."" Which once again, probably not illegal but really weird and really makes me not like him. He also tries to get me to help him with things in his apartment. Like moving things around etc. I won't do it. Not that I'm opposed to helping someone but he just makes me so uncomfortable that I don't feel good going up to his place. He asks several times a week if I can help him with a ""favor"" or ""chore"" upstairs. Haven't said yes yet. 

So that gives an idea of what he's like. He is really bad at personal space. And so far it's rubbing me the wrong way. But last week he really did something that I feel is illegal. I was having some friends over for dinner in my kitchen. While we were eating he came down and just barged into my kitchen. He stood really close to one of my friends and was like ""I heard you having a party down here and wanted to introduce myself to your friends. I don't think I've met them before."" And then he did so. All of us were pretty freaked out. We were all sitting at the table and he was standing over us, right over the table, rocking back and forth. Just kind of making small talk. Trying to get to know my friends. He has come to my kitchen doorway before to say hello while he's walking through the hallway but has never come into my kitchen. I eventually got him to leave by just saying ""Alright, bye""repeatedly and then I stood up and showed him to the door. My friends left immediately afterwards. One of them was kind of upset and just freaked out about the way he was being. I didn't know what to do. I was so mad. The next day I sent him an email, so that it could be documented in writing. I said basically, what you did last night is not okay. You are never allowed in my apartment without permission. I pay you rent for my place, you respect my privacy, Etc. Made it clear that it pissed me off and I wasn't okay with it. He tried to make me feel bad in his response and didn't really apologize. He was like ""well I heard there was company in my house and I wanted to introduce myself. I was just trying to be nice and social"" or something like that. Tried to make it seem like he's this innocent lonely old man. Doesn't seem to think that what he did was wrong! I don't buy it. Keep in mind that he's been a landlord for a long time and has had many tenants and has to know how this stuff works. He's a creep. 

So what I'm wondering is...if he does something like this again is there legal action I can take? Do landlords have to give a notice before coming into your apartment? I thought that was a thing. The reason I'm worried/wondering is because I haven't lived here but a few weeks and he's already pushed these personal boundaries very aggressively. If he continues down this path of invading my privacy, there's got to be something I can do, right?",legaladvice
[MA] HOA sued to have us join and lost. Now bills us for their legal fees.,"We bought a house in 2015 and we made damn sure that it's not part of an HOA. Soon after moving in the HOA started sending us documents about joining which we completely ignored. We were even visited once by the president of the HOA and my husband made it clear to him that we have no intention of joining.

In June 2016 we received a letter that said the HOA is considering legal action against us to have us join because by living here we are benefiting from the HOA's work without paying for it and it's a financial burden on everyone other member. The letter insisted that a legal action can be avoided if we agree to join. We ignored it.

The president visited us again in July 2016 and said the same thing, when we pretty much told him ""see you in court"".

They indeed took legal action against us earlier this year and we hired a lawyer and went to the court, their motion was dismissed immediately. We thought it's the end of it. But to make sure we had our lawyer send them a cease and desist letter to stop this constant harassment.

Now we received a letter from them, saying we need to reimburse their legal fees of about $3700 according to the article X section Y of the HOA's CC&Rs with a copy of the CC&Rs. The referenced paragraph says something along the lines of ""The association is entitled to recovery of the fees incurred by bringing legal action against the homeowner, as deemed necessary by the board to enforce the CC&Rs and preserve the best interests of the community"".

Out of the $3700, $2000 is related to their fees for suing us and the remaining $1700 are for the demand letters that they've been sending us during all these times.

We are so tired of fighting this horrible HOA and we are thinking whether we can be granted a restraining order against the HOA? What is the best way to fight this charge and make sure they will stop their harassment? ",legaladvice

"My personal tools were stolen from a company van, behind a company gate that should have been locked by a company security personnel, but wasn't. The company says I have to replace them myself, even though it was due to another employee(s)' negligence. Is this right?","All of my hand tools, my tool bag, my tool belt, my socket set and drill with batteries and a charger were stolen out of my employers 5-ton truck that was on my employers property that was behind a gate that should have been locked by a security personnel, but wasn't. I rode in the truck but did not have keys for it. I was initially told by my direct superior that the tools would be replaced, but have now found out that the company we both work for will not replace them, even though the loss was because of another one (or multiple) of their employees' negligence. 

No, I do not have my own personal insurance on them. Yes I am an employee, not sub contracted. The total value of my property loss was estimated at $3000. The employees are unionized but I am not yet a part of the union (I don't know if that makes a difference). I live in, and the theft was from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada. 

More details: there were also two company vehicles stolen and a bunch of company property. I was under the impression that I would have my stuff replaced when the company stuff was missing as they were filing an insurance claim, but they have since recovered the two vehicles and now it seems like my stuff is the only stuff not recovered, and so their tune has changed, and I'm left to fend for myself.

HOA told postal carrier that my condo is VACANT and now they refuse to deliver my mail.,"I own a condo in a small community with an HOA in Indianapolis, Indiana. The HOA president spoke to my mail carrier and told her my home was vacant. The president also looked around and through windows and ""confirmed"" it as vacant(verified by my neighbors). 


I still own the home and have things in there. It is in preforeclosure but there is no sale date until January. In between time I hope to do small renovations to increase value a little bit and try to pay back what I owe.



I spoke to post office delivery manager and they said that since the mail carrier confirmed with the HOA president that the home is vacant, they can no longer deliver there. They have already sent my mail back as return to sender.

Do I have any recourse? I tried to research and have found similar threads but they were from renters. I'm the actual homeowner.

EDIT: I was able to get the situation taken care of. I was able to speak to the postmaster and he informed me that technically after 2-3 days max IN YOUR MAILBOX they can return mail to sender. Ultimately, I'm able to receive mail again but beware , if your HOA person doesn't like you they could essentially use this lax policy against you to get your mail held.",legaladvice
Soon to be ex wife is coming after me for spousal support and isn't qualified.,"Oregon

So as the title says my, soon to be ex wife, works 15-20hrs per week making minimum wage. Doesn't have any medical disabilities or anything like that stopping her from getting a job. The job she currently has is after care for a local school. 

I have told her in the past that she needs to get something that pays more or get another job sense she has set hours and she would yell back at me that she has a job, it's not her fault she gets Summers off or doesn't work more.

I work at a grocery store in the meat department and make 40k ish a year. Working 30-40hrs a week making 19.20hr.

She currently is living with her parents and has no plans on getting her own place. Her only bills are her auto insurance and gas. Her parents pay for everything else.

I got my own place after we split up and am paying for everything myself. I have given her $770 so far to help with remaining bills.

We were married for 5 years with no kids and she is trying to get me to pay her $500 a month for 2.5 years. I countered with $250 a month for 1 year and she rejected it.

I personally think that she should not get anything and that I shouldn't have to pay someone because they were too lazy to get a job themself. Am I wrong in thinking this?

Also I have set up a consultation to get an attorney myself.

Thank you for taking the time to read.


Edit: she is a college graduate with no student loans.


UPDATE: Her attorney just called and said her counter offer is $500 mo for 18 months. This is for her education degree she has, she didn't get some final certificates when she graduated so that is her reasoning for it. I didn't say I agreed or disagreed to it. I said I will think it over. I have meeting with an attorney for myself on Thursday. Thank you all for the advice and imput on things.",legaladvice
What is the legal definition of a sandwich?,"Certain unscrupulous individuals that I am aquatinted with have recently asserted that in some jurisdictions (namely New York)  Burritos are Sandwiches. 

This is clearly a scurrilous lie.

Thus I ask you good people of Reddit, what is the legal definition of a Sandwich?

I have provided this [handy chart](http://imgur.com/5yzsKJ5) for reference purposes.

Edit: at the request of /u/foxhunter I am changing the location to Tennessee. It's a race for gold people.

Edit 2:

Full definition given by /u/JustSomeBadAdvice

Here is an attempt at a definition that includes all things commonly referred to or thought of as ""a sandwich"" and excludes all things not commonly thought of as sandwiches.

First two definitions to help:

 • Bread: A ""bread"" in this parlance refers to any grain-based dough that has been baked either by itself or with other ingredients added to it that do not constitute the sandwich ""filling.""

 • Filling: Any ingredient or ingredients normally eaten by human beings that is used to differentiate between ""two pieces of bread"" and a sandwich.

** Bread may be made of corn instead of grain if corn is merely substituted for grain using a grain-based dough receipe.

And now the definition:

 1. A sandwich is a single piece of bread or two pieces of bread(of roughly equal size) that and surrounds a filling on both the top and bottom as it is eaten, where the bottom of the sandwich is gripped by thumb(s) and the top is gripped by finger(s).

 2. The bread must have been baked prior to being combined with the filling(i.e., no Calzones)

 3. Where the sandwich is one (rather than two) pieces of bread, the filling must be typically found in two-bread sandwiches in the same form. (I.e., no burritos)

 4. Where substituted as a low-carb option, lettuce can be substituted for bread provided nothing else is changed and filling is the same as is typically found in two-bread sandwiches.

Things included in definition:

 1. Grilled Cheese Sandwiches

 2. PB&J sandwiches

 3. Submarine sandwiches

 4. Ice cream sandwiches

 5. Meat, cheese, and cracker sandwich

 6. Wraps, flatbread sandwiches, pita wraps, and gyro's (when eaten as one).

 7. Hotdogs when consumed by turning them on their side and eaten as a sandwich.

 8. Melts and Panini's

 9. Chicken salad sandwiches and tuna sandwiches.

 10. BLT sandwiches.

 11. Lettuce wraps aka unwiches when folded and eaten as sandwiches.

 12. Sloppy Joe's

 13. Quesadilla's if eaten as a sandwich.

 14. Oreo cookies and other sandwich cookies, if the cookies were baked prior to joining the filling

Things not included in definition:

 1. Tacos(how eaten)

 2. Burritos (Rule #3)

 3. Calzones (prior baking)

 4. Poptarts (prior baking)

 5. Salads (improper bread).

 6. Ravioli (Prior baking, how eaten)

 7. Chicken wings(fucking colorado) and fried foods. (how eaten, one or two pieces of bread)

 8. Pizza (bread surrounding, how eaten, prior baking)

 9. The double down is not a sandwich. It is the shame of the U.S. (And the pride of 'Murica).

 10. Burger bowls & taco salads. (how eaten)

 11. Stuffed Grape Leaves(rule 4)

 12. Chili in a bread bowl(how eaten)

 13. Dumplings(prior baking)

 14. Uncrustables(prior baking)

 15. Pigs in a blanket(prior baking)

I have no idea who created the term ""open faced sandwich"" but it is an abomination. It is either ""X on Y"" or ""X and Y"" ala Bagel & Cream Cheese or Buttered Toast or eggs on toast.

I was unable to exclude quesadillas without also excluding other things that are functionally identical to sandwiches(Wraps/grilled cheese), and I was unable to include uncrustables without also including calzones.

[TN] My landlord had a break-in a few months ago where every tennant's financial information was stolen. Now I'm getting letters about owing $2900 on a credit card.,"Back in February, the apartment complex where I live had an office break-in. At the time were assured that nothing of value was stolen and we had nothing to worry about. Last week, I got a letter from a collection agency stating I owed them around $2900 on a credit card I've never had. The account address returns to Florida, it's obviously not me. Checked my credit, sure enough about 3 weeks after the break-in the account was opened.

According to one of the managers, applications for around 300 people were stolen. Some were former tenants and people just applying, but along with it all the current tenants had their information stolen as well. The only reason I know about this is because there are at least 3 other people in this complex who have received letters from the same collection agency over the past couple of weeks. One of them put two and two together and figured the office probably wasn't telling the whole truth about the break-in. He went to the police department and received a copy of the police report through FOIA and it turns out all of our applications were kept in an unlocked file cabinet in the break room.

"California - My house burnt down, I'm being threatened by the home builder for infringing on their IP because it is being rebuilt.","This is in cookie cutter suburbia, in California.

The overall story is a bit messy, so I will keep this as short and to the point as possible. 

My homeowners insurance is helping me out here, so I ""have a lawyer"" but I wanted to see what you folks thought of this, as I have a phone meeting with my insurance company's lawyer tomorrow.

Here's what's going on:

* My house burnt down early this year. Total loss. No one was injured, but all my personal belongings are just gone.
* The source of the fire was electrical related (not my fault). The fire department said it was likely a charging lithium battery (my homeowners insurance is dealing with that situation) 
* The house is only 3 years old. 
* I purchased the house brand new, had some semi-custom things done to it, and actually had a great time with the home builder


Two months ago, once the dust settled, I reached out to the home builder (who is well known) to see how we could acquire the blueprints for my home...or at a minimum, the blueprints for my model. I also inquired about how I could engage them to rebuild my home as I am not planning on moving out of this neighborhood (I really like it here). 

They took my info and said that they would get back to me. A few days later I heard from them regarding me/my insurance hiring them to rebuild. They said they are not set up for that and would like to help, but could not...bummer, but no big deal. I once again inquired about the blueprints. They said they would have to get back to me.

Eventually they got back to me after several days and said that they would not release the blueprints to me as they are their intellectual property. Serious bummer, but whatever...

My insurance company found a local reputable home builder and they started the rebuild 5 weeks ago. 

Last week I got a cease and desist letter (with a threat to sue) form the original home builder saying that I/we were infringing on their intellectual property, they specifically called out the design of the house. Basically they know (due to the home being in an HOA) that the house will be designed back to the exact way it was before the home burned down.

Soooooo, I have a meeting tomorrow with my homeowners insurance lawyer regarding this situation. 

Have any of you ever heard of such a crazy situation? What can I expect out of this situation? My agent said she has never encountered anything like this before and she's dealt with tons of total losses for homes that get rebuilt.

Does the original home builder have any legal legs to stand on here?",legaladvice
[TX] I am the non-custodial parent of a 3yo whose mom just went to prison and is now living in a drug den. [FINAL UPDATE!],"Dear friends, its been 57 days since my first post looking for advice, and my what an [adventure](https://redd.it/5nz4yw) it has been! You people have been as big a part of this as our own family (who knew that kids tugged at reddit's heartstrings so much!), and as promised, here we are at the exciting conclusion:


* My lawyer called in a personal favor to the judge to expedite the final orders hearing as much as possible, it only took three weeks from the temporary hearing to today when we had our final; which apparently is warp speed versus the norm. 
* The mom's mom made a huge personal sacrifice by testifying, but she did, and painted a truly sad picture of what things were like before we came into the mix. We even discovered that now, while she is in prison, the mom is pregnant again and used meth intravenously the whole time until she was locked up in December.  So when she pops this one out and the baby's poop tests positive for narcotics, the state is likely to take it away. Addiction is a cruel mistress. We have gotten close to grandma and we plan to keep her close. She has always taken care of him when she was able to and really put her neck out on the line to look out for her grandson's well being. 
* We were granted **ALL** of our terms, everything! This includes a discretionary visitation claus, that basically says me and my son have to mutually agree to allow her to visit. I will not be unfair to the mom or abuse this flexibility, but it gives me a lot more leverage to require that she is clean and set healthy boundaries. 
* And here we are, a new and very happy family of three and we love the shit out of our little man (even though he is for some reason screaming about Jurassic World right now). We aren't perfect, and we are winging it at best, but we are going to bust our asses forever to give our son the life he deserves.

Landlord is shouting at pet sitter,"I live in Massachusetts.  My wife and I have been renting the same property for at least eight years.  We've always had a cat, which was permitted when we moved in.  The landlord lives on the second floor of the house, in a different apartment.

We go away on weekends with some regularity, and at the end of one such weekend this year, our landlord cornered my wife outside (I was such inside the bathroom...) and started claiming that we had a non-permitted second cat (untrue,) and said that we shouldn't have a cat if we weren't going to stay home and take care of it.  He went on to say that he didn't want us giving spare keys to anybody, which is obviously a requirement for a pet sitter.

We didn't believe he had the power to make such rules, and decided to just keep doing what we were doing, and look for a house on the side (the housing market near Boston is its own horror story.)  Well, this weekend, our sitter texted to report that when he went to the apartment, our landlord spotted him and started shouting at him.  We don't have the full story yet, but we do know that the kitty was fed.

TLDR of OP: Power was out to half my apartment for days, with no word from landlord.

Here's the update! 

The day of my post I filed a complaint with the city and sent my landlord a certified letter explaining the issue and citing Chicago Municipal Code 5-12-110 (thanks, u/Trodamus). It took my landlord another two days to call me back and another four days to get an electrician to the apartment. He was on vacation. It sounded like he had a great time.


Thanks to CMC 5-12-110, my roommate and I were able to withhold an appropriate amount of rent to reflect the reduced use of our apartment. When we mailed him our rent checks I also mailed him that page of the municipal code. It was a little petty but boy did it feel good.


Now that we've declined to resign our lease (in two months), he's claiming that he can show the apartment with as little as 15 minutes notice. He can't, he has to give at least 48 hours notice (according to 5-12-050). 


I mailed him that part of the municipal code too.

Accused of violating probation AFTER probation period.,"English isn't my first language but ill try my best.

Story goes like this. Location: Canada. I'm a British Columbia resident and got arrested in Ontario.

August 2016 I was arrested for stunt driving/excessive speeding. 

In aug 2017 I was given a conditional discharge and was put on a 1 year probation, prohibiting me from operating a motor vehicle and my license was suspended. During the probation period I didn't Drive or in anyway operated any motor vehicle.

August 2018 I've completed my driving prohibition and probation. I reacquired my drivers license.

Fast forward to 19th May 2019, while driving I was pulled over and arrested for violating probation. My car is going to be impounded for 7 days, and my license is taken away from me. What does that even mean? I haven't gotten into any trouble or received any letter about this. I'm genuinely confused and anxious. As my main Job was being a delivery driver (like skipthedishes) this affects me in a big way. I've been on my nerves since I couldn't get any help until the long weekend is over.

[UPDATE] 21st May 2019

I've been to the Vancouver provincial court where my original offence was transferred to for some answers and apparently on their side I'm cleared from probation and the driving prohibition. I was also told to go check with my local court since my new charge was sent there. Also applied for legal aid here.

I've been to my local court to ask about the new charge (18th May) and too see if they could help me clarify what is going on and they couldn't really help me. They say they would need the new charge to come to the court in order to make a clarification and apparently the file is still in transit and I should contact the transit police. 

Then I've contacted the transit police and they say I would need to wait until my court date in August then the court will have the file. 

I got an appointment for a lawyer coming up in the week hopefully he can help me.

[UPDATE] 24th May 2019

Apparently Charges came from Ontario. I haven't been to Ontario since August 2016. How?
So I have to wait until my court date for them to sort this out.",legaladvice

My post didn't get much attention but I figure I should post an update since it did get resolved in a favorable way.  This happened a couple weeks ago but I only had time to post this recently.

Since everything we had seen suggested that criminal charges were a possibility, my mother contacted the police and they visited.  She told them about the criminal charges aspect and they said they'd ask the judge about it.  The judge said that this was a civil matter, and we thought that was pretty much the end of that and that we'd just have to go to small claims over this.

However, a removal crew showed up the next day, as if by magic.  Our guess is that the neighbor decided we were serious about pursuing this when he saw the cop cars and decided to actually remove the trees.  I didn't really expect that, but I'm not going to complain about the issue being resolved at no cost to us.  We also discovered that the other tree they were asking us about may be a boundary tree when examining the property line, so we now know to keep note of that in the future.",legaladvice

First off, thanks so much for all of your concern. I was really struggling with this as a looming event in my future and after reading your advice I became really worried I was going to be married off during this trip to India.

As I said, I got back recently and I'm doing fine, nothing was out of the ordinary, we even bought a few books as my dad promised. 

Thanks again everyone! I may post again here in the future if I need any more legal help but for now this is it. I know I don't want an arranged marriage so when the time comes I am pretty sure calling Shakti will be the way I'll go. Thank you for giving me the confidence to make this decision.

Landlord drilled out my lock over the weekend and didn't give me a key.,"So long story short my landlord thinks they can do what they want.

Including but not limited to my trash,  my grand father clock that hangs on my wall etc. They also think that giving 24hr notice allows them to come anytime in the future. For instance they gave me one over a week ago and have yet to come in.  I'm sure they will any day now.  Sorry for the long post but I am at a loss on what to do here.

"Amazon Seller lost $$$ ""because of my call""","Quick story: I paid over $1000 to have a UV filter installed.  I decided, against manufacturer's suggestion, to install a generic uv bulb that was listed on amazon to be ""100% compatible"" to save a few bucks. After many months of the bulb working as described, we found the bulb had completely melted and blown out of the UV unit. When we noticed no water in the sink, we went to the crawl space to find water everywhere and the bulb 10 feet from the UV unit... and the bulb was totally melted.  I called the installer, they said they've never seen anything like this happen before (they even came to see it) and it had been a few years, so I should contact the manufacturer.   Manufacturer could tell by the photo it wasn't their bulb and also said they've not seen something like this happen before, so they blamed the generic bulb.

So, I went back to my Amazon purchase of said generic bulb and contacted the seller through Amazon.  They informed me this was not their fault and they could send me a replacement bulb.  I wrote them back, trying to continue the conversation since I didn't need a new bulb for a broken UV unit.  I waited a few weeks and no reply... so I called Amazon and asked them to put me in contact with the seller.  Amazon said I should get a call from the Seller within a few business days.  I waited a week.  So I called Amazon again and told them no one called me and asked what could they do.  So Amazon refunded my money and said to get in contact with the company directly if I could.  

The company is listed under a different name online than it is on Amazon. It was tricky to find them, but finally, I searched their logo pic on google and found the company.  I contacted them and almost immediately they wrote me back and said that because I contacted Amazon instead of them, Amazon destroyed almost $20K of their product and wanted to know what I was going to do about it... umm... I tried to contact them, they didn't contact me back, and I have 0 control over what Amazon does - and how was I supposed to contact them directly when their name online is different than on Amazon.  Yes, I complained about them to Amazon for not getting back to me, and had to explain what happened with the bulb to get request them to call me, and then again to get my refund.

[MA] Landlord let new tenant move into my vacant unit DURING my lease,"EDIT: Thanks everyone for the sanity check. I was originally a bit annoyed but considering letting this slide along with the return of my entire deposit + my A/C unit, but now I think I may go for more. Contacted a couple firms in my area to see what the next steps are.

tldr - I had overlapping leases and left my old unit vacant for a month but with a few items still there. I showed up today to do final cleaning and pick up my items and the unit was remodeled and the new tenants things were stored in the closets. My things were gone. What is my recourse?

-----

I have overlapping leases, one of them ends Aug 31st. I moved out of that unit last week of July. I was in contact with the new tenant moving in Sept 1st and he was unwilling to pay to move in early so I told him as a courtesy he could move in Aug 31 free of charge. I then left some cleaning supplies and an AC unit at my old unit, just using it as storage as I lived at my new place. I let my landlord know I was planning on moving out early and that I'd let them know when they could do a walk-through to assess the unit, and they said ""okay, let us know."" That was the last communication I had with them.

I went to my old unit today to retrieve my things and they were all gone and the unit was remodeled. The new tenant had also stored his belongings in my closet. I paid full rent for August and they did all of this without my consent or notifying me at all. They kept the AC unit and have offered to deliver it to my new address but all my cleaning supplies ($50) are gone.

I talked with the landlord and she claims the new tenant called once a day claiming I said they could move in early and the landlord eventually caved and let them. What is my recourse here? It seems insane they thought they could do all of this without my consent. I assume I am at least entitled to my full security deposit back as I was not here to confirm any damages, but what more could I hope for if I decided to take legal action?

Last communication I had with landlord was on 8/13 where I said 

""I'll let you know in the next week or two when the unit is ready for a walk through, I have a couple things still there and have to finish cleaning.""

And she said that was fine.",legaladvice
My youngest brother and his girlfriend left their daughter with me a month ago and haven't been in contact since,"To make a long story short my youngest brother and his girlfriend are completely unfit to be parents, they can't even take care of themselves. Drug use combined with alcohol abuse and just their ages 19 and 20.

My parents had him later on in life, I'm 33 and my middle brother is 28 and he's 19. He pretty much has never cared about anyone except himself. Then he met his current girlfriend and managed to knock her up between being passed out from alcohol or various drugs. We were all worried about him and the kid so we got together as a family and got him an apartment, a car etc.

Well apparantly giving him all this newly discovered freedom of his first apartment and car made him do the opposite, he didn't grow up and apparently doesn't want to take care of his own daughter. A month ago he dropped her off while he was drunk, I hit him for driving drunk with my niece and told him if he ever does it again I won't stop. 

Well now it's a month later and he hasn't come back, hasn't called, hasn't done anything. I'm not complaining about having to watch my niece, I love her. I don't want her to go back to my brother, he's not in a place to take care of her or even himself.

How can I begin to move towards becoming her guardian without a whole lot of money and is there anyway to do it somewhat quietly? The family would flip out, everyone looks at him as a baby still but he's not. He's 19 and being stupid. I don't have a lot of spare money and having to buy all the stuff related to her has been and is expensive.

[FL]Neighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent,"[MS Paint Diagram (since y'all seem to like those)](https://imgur.com/x7wGeKJ)

I inherited this house & surrounding property from my great grandparents when they passed away. This includes two rental properties, which my great-grandfather had been renting out for years to two families. Relations between the three families had always been cordial, even when my great grandparents passed a few years ago and I became the new ""landlord"", though the ""dads"" of both families are only a little younger than my grandfather, and I get the impression from our interactions they chafe a little bit that their new landlord is a woman in her late 20s, but I figured everything is fine because I've never raised the rent beyond what my great-grandfather set it at, and I always have professionals over to deal with any issues on the homes within 24 hours of receiving a call from them.

About three years ago, a local kid was messing around in my magnolia trees, and broke his leg. My homeowner's insurance paid the settlement to the kid's family, but just to be on the safe side I had a surveyor come out and mark the property line for my ""lot"" (they also used the word ""plat"", but I'll be honest, this isn't my area of expertise) vs the lots of the two rental houses, and then had a contractor come out and put a white PVC fence at the property line, just to ward off a repeat incident.

Like some kind of fairy-tale, the kids of the families that rent from me fell in love and have decided to get married. They wanted to have a ""block party"" and the bride's father asked if I'd be okay with them decorating on my property as well, since it's part of the block. I admit, I took ""decorating"" to mean things like hanging lights or other traditional wedding decorations, so I gave my consent.

This morning I woke up to the sound of chainsaws, and went outside to discover the parents of the bride & groom were cutting down my magnolia trees (each tree is about 80 years old - this house was purchased as a wedding present for my great grandmother, and they planted magnolias there when they got married. If my great grandmother had lived she'd be turning 100 next year) because they didn't match the bride's ""aesthetic vision"". 

I told them to stop immediately, I didn't give them permission for that, and I was going to call the police. They stopped, but when I went inside to grab my cell they started up again.

When I confronted them, I was basically told that since they're my tenants, I'd just be suing myself, so I could ""suck it up, buttercup"". I admit, I was more than a little intimidated by a group of men with chainsaws. I went back in my house while they continued cutting and called the police, who came out and told them to stop, and gave them tickets, but they started up again once the police were gone. I called the police again, and they haven't come back out yet. I've also already called an arborist friend of mine (I'm a florist), to come out and do an assessment immediately. I called my insurance company as well, and they're going to have someone call me back. But while I'm waiting, I thought I would ask here: Can I sue them? Or am I, as their landlord, liable for their actions against me? Needless to say, no one is getting their lease renewed, even though they've lived here for decades.

A few people suggested contacting the law firm on the subpoena which was what I had planned so I contacted them yesterday morning.

The law firm suggested contacting the police station to get a copy of the report so I called them immediately after. Now for the big twist, after giving my name and city of residence I was informed that I am listed as the VICTIM of the case and the subpoena is to testify against this woman charged of domestic violence. I've requested a copy of the case report but I don't know where to go from there. At this point I'm fully expecting to have to go to court and tell them I have no idea who this woman is and she certainly did not attack me. Thanks for the people who commented in the original thread and offered advice. I'm not sure if there is anything else I can do at this point to avoid going to court.

[Colorado] Guy threatening my family to my mother,"My mom asked me to get a bunch of viruses off her computer today. Found a folder titled, ""Sins of my Children"" and opened it. Found weird poetry and IRC chat logs of some guy offering to kill my wife and me. They seemed to be in some sort of online relationship. Half the chat was sappy love promises, the rest was her telling him about all the ways my brother and I have wronged her. Nearly everything was a lie. The accusations were insane. She gave this guy my address and a shit ton of personally identifying information about me and my wife. And he said he knew people who could ""take care of us"" for her, to show his devotion or shit. She agreed and there was a conversation negotiating prices. 

I understand he's probably bullshitting but the whole thing was deranged. The dude also doesn't live too far from me either based on what he said, a few hours drive. My wife is pregnant (this was one of my many ""sins"" apparently having my own child means I'm replacing my mom) and I am not risking of some psycho who knows my address showing up here if I can help it.

Is this serious enough to be reportable to cops or would they laugh me out of the station? Does it constitute a threat legally speaking? I took screenshots that I emailed to myself, so I have evidence if so. How should I deal with this?

The short version is, we were sued. During discovery it was found that the window that was broken was not the ships original window, and it was not even close to spec. If his boat was anything more than amarina queen and fair weather sailer, it could have broken under way under typical use.

He tried to seem ""reasonable"" by accepting he was just as at fault as the rest of us parents, and he'd pay an equal share, which was not the end result.

California - Tennant theft issue,"I purchased my first rental house in October and have been renting it to a college student since late December. I felt pretty comfortable renting it to this student because his dad owns a building moving company and had deep pockets, so I didn't need to worry too much about if they did damage to the property and I could expect rent on time. The father signed on the rental contract and pays the rent.

In January the AC unit in the house went out and I was quoted several thousand to get it replaced. Due to unrelated personal financial issues I wasn't able to get the work done immediately. I didn't want to leave my tenant without AC so I offered his father the chance to prepay 4 months rent so I could get the AC replaced immediately. I was just trying to make the best of a bad situation. 

The father was rightly pissed and chewed me out over the phone for a bit. Two days later he showed up at my house drunk and threatening/screaming/etc and saying I'd pay for screwing his son. He left after I threatened to call the police. I never heard anything from him after this, but rent kept showing up, so I decided to forget about it since the son shouldn't suffer for his fathers faults. 

I finally had the money to get the AC replaced so I scheduled the contractor to have it installed on Wednesday. Texted the son that the AC would be replaced on Wednesday and he just said ""Haha sure"". On Wednesday the contractor couldn't find the house. He told me there was no house at the address I gave him. I double checked the address with the realtor and against some documents I had but the contractor insisted it was wrong, so I scheduled him again yesterday morning so I could drive him to the house. The contractor was right, there's no longer a home at the address.

The father and son aren't responding to me any longer, but I've left voicemails. The neighbors confirmed that the house had indeed been taken by the fathers moving company. I'm really kind of shocked. I don't even know how to precede. The only reason I'm not freaking out is I know that I the father has the money the pay for this monumental fuck up. Will insurance cover this sort of thing? What type of lawyer do I need? If I find the house will I have ownership of the land it's on? Will I need to move it back to my property? Can a house be moved twice? Does this sort of thing require a permit, and could I get in trouble if he didn't have one?

"Large unleashed dog attacked my 7mo old puppy [LA,CA]","Please keep in mind that I was not actually present during the attack since I was at work.

My mother was walking my 7mo old Pomeranian (3.6lbs) puppy on a leash around her friends neighborhood when an unleashed dog (estimated 80lb) rushed out of nowhere and attacked my puppy. The large dog flipped my puppy over and pinned her down. My dogs fur is completely coated in spit.

My mother told me the man ran out yelling at his dog while exclaiming that his did not bite my puppy. (I am not sure how he knew that his dog did not bite her) This was at around 4:30PM.

Unfortunately my mother did not request this man's information under the impression that my puppy was just incredibly frightened and scared. My puppy was not bleeding and there were no signs of puncture wounds. However, her fur was covered in the older dog's saliva as mentioned earlier. The man and the large dog left the scene. We presume that this man lives in the neighborhood.

I came home from work at 5:50PM and my mother told me what happened and mentioned that my puppy was acting strange. I did research and noticed my dog was exhibiting signs of shock such as: cold paws, she won't stand, won't eat or drink, labored breathing and pale gums/tongue by this time it was now around 6:30PM. I drove her to the nearest Emergency Animal Hospital at 6:53PM where she was admitted. 

My heart dropped when I heard the news from the vet. They did some quick scans and mentioned she is has fluid in her chest cavity from blunt force trauma from the prior dog attack. The vet also informed me that she is in critical condition and that she would need to be kept for approximately 48hrs for testing and further care. 

The total vet bill is expected to be $6143.15 in treatment.

Due to my puppy's critical state they are not sure if she will even survive!

I am probably jumbling things up and not making much since because I'm in utter shock. I tried my best to write down what I know without attaching my own emotions in my post. I'm so unbelievably angry that my puppy may die due to a man who cannot supervise or control his dog.

My mom is driving back to the neighborhood (7:40PM)  to try to locate the man and his dog to tell him what happened, to get his information and to show him the vet bills. 

I'm not sure on what to do and if the man will even offer to pay for vet bills due to the high costs. I don't want to think about it but I do not know what to do if she were to pass away due to her injuries. I just got my puppy a few months ago and I saved $2400 to purchase her from a reputable breeder.

I need some advice on how to proceed with this matter. I assume I need to file a report to the city Animal Control, but do I also need to file a police report?

I'm very shaken and don't know what to do. Please lend me some advice Reddit.

Edit: This is my first post on reddit so please let me know if I broke any rules or forgot information. Thank you for your understanding.

Update: Just got an update from the vet. The prognosis is worse than originally predicted. Internal bleeding from blunt force trauma from either the liver or spleen. Vet costs will be more expensive.

Update 2: Got in contact with the man with the dog. He is getting a lawyer. Costs are too high and we are deciding to put my puppy to sleep.
——————————————————————

Update 3: The vet suggested blood transfusions due to her anemia and internal bleeding (ruptured liver/spleen) but mentioned it would have a low success rate. 

They will be refunding part of the costs because they did not perform all the listed surgeries on the care plan sheet. We are awaiting the final costs. 

Saying goodbye was extremely hard because she perked up a few times like she was OK when she saw me. Puppy has been put to sleep. I'm a wreck. 

The man mentioned we can't ""prove"" that his dog caused the damage and also told my mother he doesn't understand/put value on dogs and even can't imagine spending more than $500 on surgery for even his own wife. We took a picture of his dog, and now have his information. 

The vet will give us a detailed report on their findings to present to the man with the dog.",legaladvice

I informed my next in line who told me that anything she tried would not be handled by the military since it's a civil matter and she signed the divorce papers.

Hello r/legaladvice,

Like the title says. My owner is doing some things that I feel aren't legal. I've also requested specifics regarding these violations so that I can avoid them in the future. I am in the US and in Texas.

I'm assuming that I'm penalized when I surpass a certain RPM too quickly or apply too much pressure to the break pedal. But either the equipment isn't accurate every time or there are other variables involved because I can't seem to pinpoint what I need to do to eliminate my errors (that's just when it's within my control). The owner will not give me the guidelines to these violations so I don't even know what to not do.

After implementing this system he felt that anything below 90% (I do not know where he got this percent) would be treated as a failure for that quarter and penalize anyone who failed by taking $500 from their paychecks. I received an 89% so I was penalized. It was than discovered at a later date that the system will often times give employees a score of 99% when they hadn't even driven that day. So he changed the failure score to 89%, but would not reimburse me despite the inaccurate measuring.

I know there are things that every driver can do to make themselves better but it seems half of the time when I receive a violation it's the result of another driver which makes losing $500 even more frustrating.

I guess my concern is, can my employer create whichever kind of rules he'd like to and penalize us for whatever amount of money he wants to penalize us for not following those rules?

I'm so happy I can finally post an update on this! A week after my original post, my dad filed a petition for a change of guardianship. It took about a week after filing to set a court date, and court was yesterday (8/27).

&#x200B;

The court had appointed John an attorney and Guardian Ad Litem (which I admittedly had to look up what that meant) before the hearing. I talked with this attorney about a week before the hearing, he asked me a few questions in regards to why I wanted to be guardian, how I felt about the responsibility, if I was comfortable being put in the middle of conflict between my parents, that kind of thing. I told him I had no problems being between my parents, I've been in the middle of them before, and that this is something I've wanted since I was 8, and that I have several certifications/credentials that make me a good choice.

&#x200B;

I still had some anxiety because of my mother, I had a feeling that she was going to try to bring up some of my past (mainly try to use the Domestic Violence I survived against me somehow). My partner did a great job giving me pep talks, helping me organize, prepare the outfit I was going to wear to court, and helping me prepare what I was going to say to the judge.

&#x200B;

So, yesterday. Got to the courthouse with my dad and partner. My mother was there with my brother and some woman I'd never seen before. My mother introduced me to her as a friend of hers, and didn't talk about why this woman was there. My mom was cordial before the hearing, we talked about a separate family matter, and she didn't let on about anything that was about to happen in that courtroom.

&#x200B;

Our docket was called, we filed into the courtroom, the judge came in, standard stuff. My dad got sworn in, made his statement about why he wanted to remove John's previous guardian and appoint me. The judge seemed pleased asked if anyone objected, which is where my mother spoke up. The judge rolled his eyes, begrudgingly swore her in, and allowed her to make a statement. I should have expected this, I don't know why I was surprised... Her statement was ""I don't think she's ready. John has a rare disease, and she's not qualified. She doesn't know what it's like to do this job. While she's had her current job for a little over a year now, she's changed jobs a lot before then and moved a lot, her life has been really unstable, she doesn't have her life together."" She then went on to suggest the random woman she brought to court with her as an alternate. ""This is a personal friend of mine. I asked 5 other people, they all said 'no,' then I asked her, and she said 'yes.' She actually acknowledges John, most people don't. John knows her, he likes her. I think she would be a better option as a third party guardian instead.""

&#x200B;

The judge didn't even acknowledge the woman my mother mentioned, and he didn't even bother giving the ""she doesn't have her life together"" statement the time of day. While my mother had been talking, I had pulled out my certificates and credentials and was organizing them at the table, and the judge had noticed my preparedness. When my mother stopped talking,. the judge turned to me, asked me if I had a statement (he expected my response), and swore me in. I told the judge this was something I have wanted for 20 years, listed off my certifications and credentials, mentioned the support I have through work, my relationship with CMH, and my experience with persons with Autism. I also stated that I have no issues whatsoever with being in the middle of my parents, that I've done it before, and I'll gladly do it again. I love my parents, and while it's not pleasant being in the middle, it's not about them, it's not about me, it's about what's best for my brother. The judge seemed pleased by this and awarded me guardianship!

&#x200B;

After the gavel came down, I began walking out of the courtroom, John was walking out with me. My mother grabbed onto John and held him in the courtroom to talk to the woman she brought with her. I said ""mom, they called the next case, we have to leave,"" to which she replied ""I know"" and continued chatting with her friend. The judge was still in the courtroom, he saw it. I didn't take the bait and left the courtroom. In the hall, I was talking to John's attorney. My mother eventually came out with John, I went to give him a kiss,she kept pulling him away, and she asked me ""are you mad"" to which I simply said ""yes,"" gave John a kiss, and went to go get my paperwork. The woman my mother brought with her pulled me aside, and from the way she spoke to me, she had NO IDEA how qualified I actually I am for this, but she said ""I think you'll be a great guardian.""

&#x200B;

So, I've finally achieved something I've wanted for a very long time. My mother's already told the family that I'm not speaking to her (which is ridiculous), so that war will be starting soon. But, it's worth it. I'm so happy!!! Thanks for all the advice!!!!

So they dismissed me and told me they'd update me on what was happening if anything progressed.

Today I received this email:

>""As promised I am following up with you regarding the video in question. The attached file was anonymously sent to me. Please advise as to whether, now that you've seen it, you have any knowledge of the video or it being posted to your Instagram account.   
>  
>\-Associate Dean""

Attached to the email was the video and it was exactly what they had described. It looked like an iPhone screen recording of my story with a video I made with an ex 5 years ago that I completely forgot about. I haven't talked to my ex in 2-3 years and it was a pretty brutal breakup so I just didn't think of it but we definitely made this video.

What was really strange, other than it was up for at least an hour (according to the story stamp it said '1h') was that it had these captions on it:

""She sent this as a 'promo'""

""She said she was gonna blur my face but I don't want it up at all""

""Any ideas to prevent her from posting it without getting law enforcement involved?""

So I sent this as my reply:

&#x200B;

>""This is my first time seeing that video, that was my ex of over 5 years ago who I have not spoken to in a few years. I just tried phoning her with no response and just texted her to see if she has any idea of what's going on. Never thought about an old partner having a video of us. To my knowledge, that video was never on my Instagram, let alone left on my story for over an hour, I'm constantly on Instagram.   
>  
>I just changed my password and hope to update you soon. ""

&#x200B;

Followed soon with

>"" I can't seem to be able to reach her. I'm not sure what the video says about releasing a promo or getting law enforcement involved. We haven't talked at all within the last 2 or 3 years.   
>  
>Any ideas of what I can do? Please advise. ""

&#x200B;

I'm completely stunned. I never thought a video like that would come back to haunt me.

My primary concern is to make sure that there is no legal ground to kick me out of school or prevent me from finishing my education as I'm in my second year and more than $150,000 in debt. Other concerns include, can I get in trouble for this? And what else can I do to mitigate the situation?

"Neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. Now she's trying to sue me she were the ones with 29k in medical bills. NC USA","Sorry for the long post but I'm trying to be detailed. TLDR at the bottom. 

We live in city limits of Wake county Raleigh NC were there are strict leash laws. 

Our new neighbors moved in next door about 6 months ago and have two large Labradors who are let out the back door into the open yards each day and night. 

One of their dogs is very sweet and well behaved while the other is rather aggressive and will charge at people and other dogs. 

We have asked them multiple times to walk their dogs on leashes and explained about the city leash laws of our state and county but they refuse to keep them on leashes.  

Two months ago, one of their labs charged at myself and my small beagle from across the yard and the dogs owner just sat there and watched as I tried to fight off her dog while picking up my beagle. The dog bit my arm enough to draw blood and I kicked her dog to get it to stop and back off from its attack. 

The owner went into a rage over me kicking her dog and the next day filed a complaint against me with our HOA.  That backfired because the HOA contacted me for my side of the story and ended up charging the neighbor a $250 violation of HOA agreement fee.  I didn't file an animal control report because my bite wasn't that bad and I thought the HOA fine would set them straight.  Also for the fact that it's not the dogs fault her owner is an idiot. 

They continued to let their dogs run free and we have multiple videos of them letting their dogs run free and of the aggressive dog running onto our porch and throwing her body against our glass door trying to get at our dogs inside our house. 

Last month I confronted our neighbor with the multiple videos and told her she needed to walk them on leashes and we were no longer willing to be afraid to use our back porch or walk our dogs anymore and told her this was the last time we'd be nicely asking her and next time we'd call animal control. 

Fast forward to 6 days ago when I woke up to the sound of one of my dogs for lack of better term, screaming. I jumped out of bed and ran into the yard where my sister and one of my beagles was being attacked by her dog.  My sister had curled around our dog and was being repeatedly bitten by the neighbors dog. 

I tackled the neighbors dog and (not proud to say as a life long animal lover) proceed to grab the dog by her neck and force her to the ground by her neck and shove her head into the ground while practically sitting on the dog to control her. 

The neighbor finally got her dog inside. The results were my dog had a huge chunk ripped out of her throat, multiple rips in both ears, 6 broken teeth on her bottom jaw,  a shattered front paw and broken arm, and multiple bites to her face and rib cage.   My dog needed all broken teeth removed, pins in her arm and paw, dozens of stitches, and a skin graph (had no idea they could do this for dogs) to close the hole in her neck.  

My sister needed 38 stitches from the bites she received, I ended up with 29 stitches from bites I received, and all three of us are on a plethora of antibiotics and follow up care including rabies shots for my sister and I because her dog had no current shots.  Those shots are not pleasant in any way. 

Our combined medical/vet bills are 29k with still needing follow up visits for all of us over the next few months. 

She's refusing to pay anything at all and claims she's not at fault because our yard isn't fenced. She's also claiming she's going to sue us because apparently I broke 2 of her dogs ribs when I tackled her to the ground. 

I cleared out my savings account of 3500 to make the basic payments to save my dogs life and don't have any more money to hire a lawyer.  

We can hardly afford the co pays on our insurance to get our rabies treatments and prescriptions filled.  I filed to get an advance on my pay but it can take up to two weeks to go through and I was served with a court summons today for injuries to her dog and her pain and suffering from the trauma of her hurt pet. The claim also states that I intentional caused harm to her pet and used unnecessary force to subdue her pet. I'm a 4'10 female and my sister is a 4' 8 female. Her dog is almost as big as I am. 

I really don't know where to start on how to deal with this. I feel like we have a solid case due to the videos and and the paperwork from the HOA for the first time she tried to blame us.  I also have messages that span her time as our neighbor via the Nextdoor app where she admits to walking her pets off leash and her refusal to stop because it's ""her house.""

How in the world can I fight this without being able to pay a lawyers fee upfront?

TLDR: Neighbors aggressive dog attacked my dog, sister, and I causing insane medical bills and months of follow up care and now I'm being sued.  I work 3 jobs and after basic medical bills can't afford a lawyer yet. Not to mention my hand is so chewed up and swollen I'm not cleared to go back to work at any of my jobs until I get stitches out and get motion in my hand back which will cause more income issues once my vacation days run out. 

Edit:  
Thank you all so much for the advice. We're feeling much more hopeful and I feel like I can actually sleep tonight. 
You're all wonderful kind internet strangers and we appreciate you all. 

UPDATE AFTER FILING A POLICE REPORT:

My sister and I went to the police station this morning. 
The officer suggested  we each file our own reports for multiple reasons with one being my sister wasn't involved in the first attack and we each technically own one dog even though we share expenses.  One dog I bought from a rescue and is ""property"" in my name and the attacked dog was bought under my sisters name.  The video evidence was used for both reports but the messages were used for mine only since they came from my account. 

The officer called animal control and viewed it as a good use of their weekend emergency service because the neighbor did not/could not provide proof of a rabies shot and is viewed as a public health risk and no one can confirm the dogs violence isn't attributed to that. That's probably not the case but city law requires all dogs within city limits to be registered with the city and up to date on all shots. 

He suggested that we take our dogs and cars and leave the neighborhood between 2:00pm to 6:00pm or until we receive a follow up call from animal control.   He also suggested we call our home owners insurance after we were done at the station and had a police report to give them.  The police took photos of our injuries and said we need to take pictures of our dog once we got home. 

We already took photos of ourselves and dog last night after reading through comments on here, but they wanted their own to file with the report. 

We asked about getting a protection or restraining order but he said it would be very hard to do because we'd have the burden of proof showing that she maliciously and intentionally used her dog to harm us or prove a history of stalking us. 

My boyfriend went out this morning and bought two cameras and a stack of SD cards.  He has one set up to look out over our back yard and one looking out to where we park our cars and front porch.  This lady is still letting her dogs run out free after the attack and we can get that on video. 

My sister, dogs, and I are going to spend the night at my boyfriends house tonight just so we can stay clear of the crazy neighbor. 

We called our insurance company and are giving them all the reports, bills, evidence, etc.  they're sending an agent out tomorrow afternoon to take video and pictures of both yards and the gave us a list of local law firms that specialize in personal injury and property damage cases and will work in conjunction with whatever lawyer we go with.  One thing the insurance company pointed out is they don't see any law firm named in my summons and think she may have filed and be representing herself.  They also said the roommate texting us all week saying they'd pay for everything could be viewed as their admittance of fault but a lawyer would be able to confirm that. 

We did message most of the neighbors on our row and a few of them have had bad experiences and are willing to write statements.  The kicker is the family directly behind us has a teenage son who took a VIDEO on his phone of the big attack!  The neighbor dog had tried to attack her sons cat while he was on the back porch once and her son heard the yelling and whipped out his phone.  I haven't seen it yet but his mother said they'll gladly turn it over to our lawyer and write statements.  

We're going to be busy this week and have a lot to do to get everything together but it seems like we have a very solid case. 

Thank you so much for all of your advice and time. You guys are incredible.  I'll continue to update or do an update thread when we have talked to a lawyer. ",legaladvice
"Neighbour damaged their car pulling into my driveway - want us to pay for ""repairs"" [Ontario Canada]","Neighbour across the street (entire family) uses our driveway to pull into before backing into their own driveway. We have asked them to stop but they ignore us (they said there is no city bylaw against it which I believe is correct). In the past, they have damaged our lawn, broken our garbage can and damaged our recycling / compost bins. 

Today was garbage day and I put out some broken shelves at the end of our driveway with the garbage can and other bins to make it easier for the garbage workers to reach (because of the snowbanks). About an hour ago, angry neighbour shows up at our door saying we need to keep our driveway clear at all times and the trash there damaged their car when they pulled in. He wanted to know where they should send their car for repairs since we would be paying.

To say I'm angry is an understatement. He claimed the first few feet of our driveway is public property controlled by the city and since it wasn't kept clean and damaged his car we need to pay.

I asked him to leave our property before I called the police... he told me to go ahead. At that point, I closed the door and locked it.

Can I have a girl sign a contract that either forces her to get an abortion or gets me off the hook for child support?,"No. You cannot.

We get multiple questions a week with guys asking if they can write up an enforceable contract that forces the woman they slept with to get an abortion if she gets pregnant. In addition, many of these people also want to know if they can have her sign a contract making it impossible for her to collect child support.

If you don't want to worry about unintended pregnancy, don't have sex. If you are going to be an adult and have a sexual relationship, you also need to be an adult and understand that children can result from your actions.

>In sum, the judge found that family matters are matters of public interest, and the consequences of family contracts (and the court's decisions regarding them) are more significant to society than those of other contracts.
Accordingly, the public interest must always be taken into account because the impairment or breach of family responsibilities generally results in injury to the public wholly apart from the effect upon the parties immediately concerned.",legaladvice
Coworker gave me an edible and it took me to the emergency room.,"So i'll try to keep this as short as possible.

I live in California so I know it's legal but I don't go to the dispensary because my wife thinks weed is terrible for you and she doesn't want me using it. My coworker came in to work today with some brownies he had made at home and offered me one.  I ask him if there's any weed in them and he says ""no"". I grab one and begin to pounded it down with my coffee except I notice it tastes a bit funny. I ask about the flavor and he says ""Its made from all organic, different than typical brownies"" and laughs it off.

I start to breath manually and I freak the fuck out. I have no idea what's going on and I end up asking my boss to call an ambulance. 

I end up getting picked up and taken to the hospital and the paramedics are asking me questions on how i'm feeling, if I took anything, etc. I tell them I didn't take anything and they tell me I was having an anxiety attack. I get to the hospital and my coworker texts me saying he put marijuana in the brownies and thought it would be funny to see me high at work. I tell paramedic I ingested a marijuana infused brownie and he tells me to just stay hydrated and relax. I feel like shit and i'm stuck in a hospital right now and i'm beyond pissed off. I dont know what to do and how to bring this up to my boss or if I should pursue a lawyer. Please help! 

Edit: He is now telling me I can't tell my boss or HR because I'd get fired for using marijuana on the job.

I did all the lawyer stuff they needed providing things like bank statements to prove the money situation and everything and we did the filing with the court.

Turns out he did quit his job and before he left tried to make things worse by removing his card from the bills that he could and had the cellphone bill go-to a paper bill instead of paperless and tried a few others but when they wouldn't let him it now makes sense why he cancelled his credit card and mine. The bill still comes but since those were in his name I guess I don't need to worry about that just yet.

Now the bad news sadly, since they don't know where he is nothing really changes at all and now  I have to wait and see what happens. There is another date over a month away to start the divorce but apparently that's going to become an issue too since he needs to be found or we wait longer again from what I was told.

One final fun thing I'm pretty certain he did but they won't tell me is I had two CPS people showup and inform me of allegations that I cannot take care of my child/provide diapers or food etc. Once I explained it all to them, and showed them what I had from my lawyer they seemed to just let it be. I guess partners trying to use them as a way to harass the other isn't anything new to them, except they will still be checking in apparently to make sure.",legaladvice

"After years of thinking that I lost my dog, I was told that he has been found and that there is a possibility that I might not get him back.","6 years ago I moved to Missouri from Hawaii with my ex-husband, our 2 kids and my dog. I worked a day shift an hour away and my ex worked nights. I had to put our kids in daycare because my ex needed his time to rest during the day. 3.5 years ago, I came home and my dog was gone. My ex told me that he must have ran away. I searched and posted flyers, but I didn't get any leads. During the divorce my ex told me the truth and said he gave my dog away because he couldn't get any rest with the dog at home with him and he posted an ad on craigslist. I was livid!

Today I received an email from a vet clinic in Texas saying that a pet was found yesterday. They said that he was microchipped and it was registered to a shelter and they gave them my information. I cried. They proceeded to ask me to describe him and asked if I had any pictures of him. I gave them a description, the name of the shelter that I rescued him from and sent pictures. The emails stopped. I called after work and they already knew my name, the name of the shelter and said that they received my emails with the description and pictures. I was told that they haven't dealt with this situation before and needed to ask the doctor's lawyer about what to do. I was told that the lady that found my dog brought him in and said that if nobody claims him that she wants to keep him. I made it very clear that I'm claiming him and didn't understand why there was any confusion about me getting my dog back. She said that in Texas there are property laws and since pets are considered property they want to make sure that they are doing the right thing. She then said that she was leaving for the day and said hopefully we'll hear back from the lawyer by Monday and hurried off of the phone since they were closing. 

I'm on an emotional roller coaster right now. I have tried googling pet ownership laws, but I'm getting mixed results. 

TL;DR My ex-husband gave my dog away 3.5 years ago. I was contacted by a vet office in TX saying that he was found yesterday. They won't release him to me until they hear back from their lawyer because the lady who found him wants to keep him. I'm in Missouri. Can they prevent me from getting my dog back?

[CA] Disappearing College Fund - Dad says it exists. Mom says it doesn't. Dad shows old statement. Account under Mom's name.,"CA as in California not Canada.

&#x200B;

tldr

Parents are divorced.  According to my Dad, there should be over $50K set aside for me and my younger siblings education.  I'm transferring from community college into an expensive school and ask my mom for access to the account which according to her doesn't exist.  Mom is defensive and confrontational and won't allow me to look at any of her paperwork or statements.  Dad sends me picture of old statement showing existence of account.  Do I have any options here?

end tldr

&#x200B;

I'd like to start this off by saying that my parents split up for the second time during my last year of high school and finalized their divorce a year or so after.  My younger siblings (brother and sister) went with my mother to live with my grandparents, and while I was undecided, I eventually agreed to leave after being given an ultimatum which involved not seeing my siblings.

Skipping forward to me enrolling in a Community College nearby along with my mother who was going back to school, my mother told me to keep finances a secret from my father as I applied for financial aid and was told I would lose it if someone found out.  I was also working at the time and was giving half of my paycheck and half my financial aid to my mom.  I've started working less to accommodate school and negotiated to only half my financial aid going to my mom.  My father would ask me if I was using my college account which I claimed ignorance and said my mom handled the finances when in reality my financial aid covered my classes.

Moving forward to today... I was accepted into a great school with an even better campus, my mom is in a respiratory therapy program at the school.  I went to visit my dad two days ago and talked about school and how terrible it will be to pay thousands a month on shared housing.  He told me to use my college fund and that I shouldn't have to pay out of pocket after all the money that he set aside for me and my siblings.  I had completely forgotten about the existence of my college fund and after having dinner I went home to my maternal grandparents' home.

I brought up my college fund and my mother completely flipped out asking what I was talking about and that my dad had taken everything from her.  She asked how much I thought I had in there and I stated at least $10K (my dad told me I should alone have $40K) and she laughed in my face and said to go ask my dad where the money went.  I pressed her further saying maybe we should look through the divorce papers to find how things were split up and she yelled at me saying that I didn't know how a college fund worked and that if it existed it would be under her name and she could do whatever she wanted with it.  She also went on to say that she was thinking about working extra to send me $500/month but she might have to reconsider.  I told her if her statement about my dad taking the money was true, then we should look through the divorce papers to see how the accounts were split up, she was completely opposed to the idea and said I was just like my father and started bad mouthing both him and I to my younger siblings.

I contacted my dad soon after and talked to him about what happened.  He figured she cashed out and used the money on her family and told me we'll talk tomorrow.  Today he sent me a picture of a bank statement dated from 2010 saying that there is an account under my mom's name with $14K and me as the benefactor.  He went further to say that the market has increased 300% and that I should have way more.  He also said that he has statements pertaining to college funds for my little sister and brother.

I want to know how to proceed from here, not only for myself but for my siblings who are far more studious and deserving than I am.  My sister is going into high school with a 4.0 and my brother is a little over a year away from graduating with a 4.3 gpa.  Both have very high hopes for college and so do I.  I want to know what my best course of action is here- if I have any.  My next goal is to get my father's copy of the divorce papers and read through them and map out exactly how things were divided.

Edit: She definitely has assets.  The price of housing has gone through the roof here and she should have hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank from selling and splitting our house.  However, she says she will not touch that money as she is saving it for a house once we move out and she finishes school.

&#x200B;

Edit2: She knows I know about the bank statement.  Apparently my dad sent the picture to my sister and she showed it to my mom.  I haven't talked to her since and don't plan on it.  If only CA was single party consent...

&#x200B;

Edit3: Came back from the police station.  Tried making a report that my mom would probably make something up and try getting me to face criminal charges.  Desk jockey told me they wouldn't take the report.  Also it seems like there is no recourse when it comes to her emptying the accounts unless the divorce mandates that the money goes to us.  Probably will still consult a lawyer and if things don't work out I'll just have to collect whatever evidence I can get and go full transparency with the family.

&#x200B;

Edit4: When I said make a police report it was because she has made some pretty wild accusations in the past when she gets backed into a corner.  Her personal favorites are calling people pedophiles, psychopaths, dangerous, and something about taking her as a hostage.

&#x200B;

Edit5: Looks like the party is over.  Time for me to start doing some heavy lifting.  Gonna try and confirm the money existed after the divorce.  If it did, I need to find out what happened to it.  If the divorce mandates that the money goes to us or it's a UTMA account that'll be pretty neat.  If she cashed, didn't report it as income, and I can get the IRS to audit her then I'm going to have a lot of fun.  If it's intact, which is unlikely, maybe I can get some family pressure.  Otherwise I'm gonna just neatly compile everything I have into pamphlets and hand it out to the family and hopefully make her too embarrassed to show her face ever again.  Mixed advice on consulting a lawyer, but the only thing it hurts is my wallet so I'll probably get a professional opinion.  Also I already told her, since she's very religious, that she needs to pray every day for the rest of her life if she ever hopes to meet her grandkids.  Also I'm a dude.",legaladvice
[MI] Do I need a lawyer for an age discrimination lawsuit?,"Please hear me out.

I met up with a guy from Plenty of Fish. He seemed normal when we were talking. So I meet him at the restaurant and there is an obviously much older man than the 30 year old that he claimed to be. I sat down and I told him I was under the assumption he was younger and he had told me he was younger. He claimed they were older pictures and that it must have been a typo (although his profile also said 30) and that he was actually 45 years old. I told him I was not interested in someone almost 20 years older than me and I wished him well. He began to raise his voice a little saying he had already ordered a dish and wine for me and I needed to sit down and eat with him. I went to the bartender and gave a brief explanation of what had happened and the manager walked me to my car while the bartender stayed with the guy to make sure he didn't follow me.

I went about my merry way for a couple of months before I was served at work with papers stating I was being sued. I called the attorney listed to verify and he confirmed that they were real, he was a client and I was being sued the cost of the entire dinner and his travel expenses because I used his age as discrimination, which was also illegal. I made the mistake of giving him my last name, which is not common and he found my employer on Facebook. Everything has since been locked down or deleted.

Father killed in hit and run [CT],"So this is basically my first time posting anything of relevance to Reddit, so I apologize if I'm doing this wrong in any way. 

My [22 F] father [62 M] was hit and killed by a car that drove away the other day. The police are trying to investigate any cameras that are in the area, but I'm afraid there aren't many. 

Also, I am technically the only person my father has. His parents passed away. He hasn't talked to his brother in 15+ years. I have to cover ALL legal stuff and I am stuck. My brother (who has a different father) has made many phone calls regarding obtaining his body, police reports, etc.

My question is, once they find this person that HIT AND KILLED my father and drove away, what legal ways do I go about it? Do I sue this person? What do I sue this person for? 

In all honesty, this is just so hard to deal with. To deal with not knowing. I guess if you have any advice pertaining to this, I would much appreciate it. 

Edit to add a little bit more background information/specifics:

I did not live with my father at the time and he did not own a house. He was staying with a neighbor. He also did not own a car. He was walking across an intersection when this happened, but it happened at 6:45pm and officers are saying it may be hard to see any evidence with street light cameras because it was dark at the time.

My Wife of almost 17 years just passed away suddenly at 36. She was the only woman I've ever loved. I have 3 kids and a Nuclear War with Her Family. What should I do?,"Canada.
We were having a fight for a few days and i moved a few things over to a friends. Two days later my phone rings from our neighbour asking why there is a fire truck and ambulance at my house. My 5 year old and 13 year old boys were there playing video games while she laid down in bed not feeling well and had a heart attack apparently. Doctors said she went 45 minutes plus without oxygen to her brain. My 13 year old said that the little one came and said that Mum won't wake up. Her parents are acting like i murdered her and swept my children to their house. Her family is huge and I have none. They were my Family. They are telling me that we were separated and it doesn't matter how long. I was a stay at home dad and also worked nights in the family business. I have a Legal Aid lawyer but they have said i need a private bar lawyer to pursue property issues. I have no money for that. They went into my house and took all the legal documents and jewelry. They took her phone and read all of our intimate text messages. I have had a complete mental breakdown and have so far left my children with them as not to upset them any further and have been dealing with this solely by Myself. How can people be like this regardless of their opinion of our life. We were happy and did it on our own. Just trying to type this out and maybe see what anyone else has to say. I am so confused and broken. Why do these people think my children should lose both parents because we were in a deep argument. 16 years, 10 months and 30 days we were together. House paid off. We must have been doing something right but not according to these people. I am no perfect angel but my heart has always been in the right place. They are very wealthy. All of a sudden my Daughter wont take the phone to speak to me which was a complete surprise yesterday. We did family hugs and said i love you daily. I have always been there and been over the top protective. If they had a problem with my parenting why have they never said it before and now tell me they are ""protecting"" them? I was always a good loving Dad. I am so worried about my children these people are not what my kids need. they need to be with me. They have been with me their entire lives and now this? How can they do this? I miss her so much. I want to comfort my children. They told me to get my ""stuff"" together and in the future I can be the Dad again and they will be the Grandparents. Wth? Who made them the powers of the universe. I need help.
I don't know if this is the right sub. There is so much more to the story. Is there anybody out there? I am reaching out to the internet for this as i am stumped legally and so much more. Kids are now 14, 11, and 5. I'n in complete electrifying terror. I miss my Woman so bad. She was the only person I could talk to because we ""got it"" in terms of life. Pressure somehow got to us. Trying my best here. Sorry if formatting is bad I am all over the place. There were no abuse issues in the house. Some arguing about chores/ video games/ etc.",legaladvice
My future mother in law ruined by wedding dress by attempting to try it on. It's beyond repair. Can I take her to court?,"I'm located in Virginia. I purchased a wedding gown that cost me over $11k, then paid substantially more in alterations. Over the weekend, my future mother in law decided to attempt to put on my dress and failed horribly. Long story short, it's beyond repair and completely ruined. I also have reason to believe that she caused deliberate damage to the dress because of certain areas that were torn. 

My fiance doesn't believe that we're able to take her to court and recoop the money because ""it's just a dress"" and he thinks the cost of the dress doesn't meet some financial threshold to sue her. I want to know if that's true and if it would be feasible to file a police report on her because of the more deliberate damage. I know it's just ""a dress"" but this goes beyond the dress.

Wrongfully arrested at work for unpaid child support payments. I don't have a child. Was let go by employer as a result. Who do I sue?,"Alright I'm pissed as hell. Last week out of the blue cops came and told me that I'm under arrest for unpaid child support. I told them that I don't have a child and they said they don't care and they have to arrest me. I asked to see the arrest warrant but they pushed me to the wall and handcuffed me and took me. I work at a credit union. This happened in front of people. 

Later that day, they let me go telling me this has been a mistake. I asked for details but the officer told me to ""count myself lucky"" and ""don't push my luck"" and ""get the hell out of here"".

I came back the next day to my job only to learn the I was being let go because the union needs to save face. Boss told me that he's sorry but this is a policy and they let people go at the first sight of issues with law that are brought to work. My contract was at will. Boss also said that he's sorry but he's going to have to inform anyone who seeks references of what he observed (in other words, my career is ruined as nobody will hire me anymore).

This is ridiculous. They can't do this to my life and get away with it. Do I have any rights? This has resulted in me losing a job, probably ruined career and reputation. Who do I sue for damages?

"(PA) I do furry art for living despite not being a furry. One of my clients learned this, and told me he would sue me for fraud and lying. I brushed it off, but got something about it in the mail today.","Hello all. I was a pretty broke artist. A few years ago, I learned that the furry scene, especially NSFW, was a great way to make money (despite me not being a furry). I have now a decent amount of clients and fans and am able to pay bills / pay for college education. Not to toot my horn, but I think my stuff is pretty good. 

I have one specific client who has been following me since the beginning days. He has spent well over 8k on commissions and prints from me. Recently, I was at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh and was with some of my friends. I said I wasn't even a furry in passing to them. He was at my table in his fursuit. He sounded pretty angry, but ended up stomping off then. Later that day, I got an email from him saying he was going to sue me for not being a furry but making furry art... for lying to him and for fraud. I brushed that off. A few days later, he also ""exposed"" me on social media and I have gotten a few more messages from people saying they won't be buying art from me anymore. I am a little worried that that will impact my business as well. 

Anywho, I got papers in the mail today that looked legit saying I was going to be sued for the money he spent on my art. What do? Shoud I lawyer up?  I can't afford too much but I should be able to out of my sayings. I was also wondering if there was action I could take towards him for ""exposing"" me.

Can I sue my landlord for coming into my apartment and asking if I would allow him to suck on my toes?,"(I posted this already in r/nostupidquestions but they referred me here)

This is honestly a super bizarre story from the beginning, but it all started with a strange encounter that happened with my landlord this past Monday night.

To give you some brief background information, I have lived in the studio apartment on the end of the building he owns. It consists of his apartment on the end, then in the middle is our neighbor who lives alone, then there's me on the other end. I've lived there by myself for about a year and a half now, and there have never been any incidents like this until now. I'm a 26-year-old female and he's about in his late 40s or early 50s. 

But here's a quick run-down of what happened that night. It first started when I called him to let him know I had the rent for the week. When he came to my door to collect it as he always does, he randomly asked if I was okay. My friend was over at the time so he motioned for me to step out. I do, then the first thing he tells me is that he recently saw me smoking meth or crack in the driveway which is 100% false, meaning at this point I'm already confused and realizing something strange is going on. I immediately was like uhhh no you didn't because I don't even smoke weed or cigarettes, let alone fucking meth or crack. He then said he saw me get out of my friend's SUV one day blowing out a bunch of smoke. I just told him he definitely didn't see me blow anything out, and that we could go get a drug test if he's really that worried about it. He then said never mind, he just wanted to make sure I was okay. so i thought that was weird as hell, because even if he did see me blow smoke out why would he automatically assume it was meth or crack?

But then, he called me right after my friend left to apologize, and asked if he could stop by. I said yes thinking nothing of it, assuming he wanted to check the place out and make sure there wasn't anything sketchy going on regarding drugs which apparently is my thing now. He comes in and sits down on the bed (since i don't have couches or anything), but I immediately offered for him to sit in the fold-out chair but he said he was fine where he was. 

He then starts initiating small talk, asking how my job is going and whatnot, before randomly stating that he just gets lonely at his place by himself so he wanted to stop by for a few. So I was like okay... starting to get a weird vibe from him. 

At some point we end up on the topic of politics, and I was just saying how I try to be as open-minded as possible when it comes to stuff like that, blah blah blah. At this point I come up with a reason to leave by saying I'm late to meet my friend for dinner. So I get up to get my shoes and he suddenly asks ""so how open-minded are you?"" and I was like uh... what do you mean? To which he replies, ""Oh, well I happen to have a bit of a foot fetish... and was wondering if I could suck on your toes for a bit"".

I was immediately taken aback, because this came out of nowhere and I'm starting to feel increasingly uncomfortable with the whole situation. I simply explained that I don't like people touching my feet while heading towards the door. He then gets up and kinda steps in front of the door and goes ""you won't just give me 5 minutes? That's all i need is 5 minutes"". So I went and stood by the knives, because I don't know what he's about to do and I'm getting a full-on rapey vibe at this point. He asked me about one or two times before finally opening the door and letting me out. 

I just have no idea what to do or how to go about this situation. I know nothing physical happened, but the entire encounter was so bizarre and unsettling that it's legitimately fucking with me. I don't even feel comfortable being in my own apartment by myself, especially since he has the keys to get in. 

I'm currently looking for new places to go but is it something worse suing over? Do I need more proof? Or do I just leave the whole thing alone and hope I find a new place quickly?",legaladvice
*UPDATE* My sons mothers bf made him pee in a pill bottle,"I posted the link to the original post at the bottom of the page. I've been working on things on my end but 4 days back cps made my sons mother take a drug test. She failed and they came to pick up the kids and she wouldn't let them in. The police had to kick the door in and take the kids. They then placed them with her father. Nobody had notified me or called me about any of this or my son. I had been calling once a day to check on him and not getting an answer. I eventually called her stepfather who informed me what had happened and asked if anyone had called me and I told him they haven't. I had no idea about any of it. When I found out yesterday I immediately went to cps and met with the caseworker who told me to go home and she would be there within an hour to check my home to make sure my son could live there. I waited all night and nobody ever came or called. I'm preparing to go to cps when I get off of work this morning. Is there anything I should be doing besides talking to cps who really don't seem to care at all about how badly I want my son with me where he is taken care of and safe? I feel like all of these events were hidden from me due to the fact that I could get my son based on these events. Should I still get a lawyer for custody or could the state give me custody over this matter?

Edit: CPS removed my son from his grandfathers and gave me full custody! Thanks for all of the advice! He's so excited to see me and be with me! 

Edit 2: Thanks for my first gold and silver I just wish it was under better circumstances! Thanks so much though!

"[TX] My apartment complex in a college town was advertised as a ""gated community"". In the last 3 months I've lived here, the gates have never been closed and now a resident has been robbed at gunpoint on site. Is there anything we can do?","**SEE EDIT**


Most of the info is in the title. My complex specifically advertises itself as a gated community, has 2 entrance gates and a guard booth between them. Since I moved in in august I have NEVER seen the gates closed or a guard/employee posted in the booth, despite many emails warning that after the first month the gates would be closed and a permit would be required to enter.

I had this exact same issue at my last apartment and it bothered me, but I had so many other issues with it it was comparatively NBD.

Now one of the residents of my complex has alerted everybody that a few nights ago he was robbed at gunpoint outside his building. Another resident said that this new no-closing the gate activity is relatively new (within the last 6 months) and hes never felt more unsafe than now. And to clarify, we're talking ""random dude with a gun wandering the complex"" mugging not ""weird guy he knew went crazy and pointed a gun at him"" mugging.

The question really boils down to this, if a complex advertises itself as a ""gated community"" (this is still on their website on the main page), do they actually have any requirements in terms of actually USING the gates?

EDIT: apparently multiple people have already began their crusade against the complex, as they just sent an email out to everyone claiming the gates will be closing every night starting tonight",legaladvice
I sent my Nintendo Switch for repair and all I got back was my charger.,"So my switch broke over the Christmas holidays and I booked a repair with the official Nintendo customer support. It was sent off at the start of January and 2 weeks later I received an email saying that they inspected the charger and it was working fine and they were going to send it back. I immediately did a live chat with customer support telling them that I had also sent a switch and that was what needed to be repaired. The staff member I was talking to said there was no switch received and that they would open an investigation. Over the past month and a half I have done many live chats asking what the situation with the case is because I didn't get a single update. Today I received an email from Nintendo customer support saying that they will not be providing me with a replacement as they cannot prove that the switch was sent. I have no idea what to do now, The postage was prepaid for the parcel I sent it in so I don't actually have solid evidence that the console was sent. I'm living in Ireland and it had to be sent to the UK repair center.

Job offer rescinded after employer learned about my disability. [NY],"I'm a software engineer and last week I received an offer after I completed the interview process. I countered and the hiring manager asked to see me to finalize the negotiations in person.

I lost my index finger at the age of 14 (I am 33 now). I have completely adapted to this and it has no effect on my ability to work. I studied CS in college and have been working as a software engineer for over a decade.

Basically after this hiring manager noticed my finger, he said the offer is off and quoted that they're looking for someone who is physically able to perform the job. So we didn't even attempt to negotiate and I was out of the door in less than 2 minutes.

I'm aware that discrimination against people with disability is illegal but I'm also aware that if a disability disallows someone from doing their job properly then it's fine (you can't be a customer service agent at a call center if you're deaf).

Found an abandoned dog while on vacation and had to get it euthanized. Turns out it belonged to my Airbnb host.,"this is really long but i want to make sure i convey the entirety of the situation. **tldr and update at the bottom.**

this weekend my boyfriend and i stayed at an airbnb in the desert in **nevada**. the place we stayed at was on a lovely ranch that had a bunch of animals — horses, dogs, rabbits, chickens, etc. the day we arrived the place was ready for us but no one was at the ranch. there were several ranch dogs running around who looked very well-taken care of and were super friendly, despite being stuck outside in the 113 degree heat. 

my boyfriend and i were walking around scoping out the ranch and trying to see if we could find the host or anyone that worked there, petting the dogs, taking some photos/etc. then we saw this other dog walking around slowly. when we got closer we were horrified at his condition — i don't even know where to start. 

you could see every one of his bones. he looked like a lab/retriever/shepherd mix but his hair was so matted and dreaded i wasn't sure. he could barely barely walk. he was covered in flies and smelled like a corpse. his eyes were so infected they had sunken in and there were flies in his eyelids. his nose was super rotted/scabbed up and raw, and he was missing half his teeth. i'm pretty sure he was deaf because he only responded to us when we knelt down in front of him. he was covered in sores and open wounds. he was wearing a heavy studded leather collar with no tag, and there was an open wound under the collar from how much it had rubbed into his skin. the pus/blood from the wound had rusted the buckle on the collar so we couldn't even get it off.

when we found the dog we desperately tried to find someone at the ranch but for some reason no one was there (it was like 5/6pm). we had no cell service so we couldn't get in touch w our airbnb host and the wifi code they gave us didn't work. we were positive the dog wasn't theirs anyway, because there were several other dogs on the property who looked very fat and happy and healthy. 

we got the dog some water and fed him some soft bread. he was ravenous and practically inhaled that water and two more bowls we filled for him. then he collapsed at my feet and legitimately thought he was going to die. we decided to take him to a vet or a shelter  but because we were in the wilderness, the nearest one was an hour away. 

i wrapped him up in a blanket and held him in the backseat while my boyfriend sped to the vet. the car was full of flies. we cranked the AC and he slept the whole way there. we carried him into the vet and they took him back. while i was filling out paperwork, the vet tech came out and told us that his wounds were full of maggots that had gotten so deep into his body it wasn't possible to save him so they'd have to put him down. 

i knew he was in bad shape but i guess part of me was sure he could be saved. i was fucking heartbroken, and i know he's not in pain anymore but i was so so sad he was stuck out in the desert without anyone to love him for so long. we named him stevie. 

ANYWAY! we got back to our airbnb, the next morning got breakfast and met the host etc etc. we were chatting and i decided to tell her about the dog in case the owner ever came around looking for him (doubtful). it turns out that the dog belonged to the fucking ranch!! the lady was saying all this insane shit about how the dog just pretends to be really droopy and sad so you'll give him attention, and he's just old. she said they'd been thinking about putting him down for the last SIX weeks but they wanted to ""let nature take its course."" i was losing my shit but just kept my cool cus i didn't wanna piss her off considering the delicate situation of me uh, putting her dog down. she seemed very nonplussed about it, but she did say that she's glad we told her because if the dog had gone missing, ""we would have frantically looked all over for the little guy."" ???? how do you care about a dog and also let it become malnourished and infested with maggots and flies? 

and THEN she asked if we were able to recover the collar from the vet (!???&$) and i said no because the collar was rotted into his flesh...

we left the airbnb a little later and then she messaged me via airbnb and asked me for the info and name of the vet we took him to. i gave her the info and called the vet just to give them a heads up that the owners might come asking for the dog. 

so to get to my question — i'm concerned this woman might try to go after me for getting her dog put down (despite the fact that she said they were planning on doing it themselves and that they wanted ""nature to take its course""). is this even remotely a possibility or am i just being paranoid? i should have maybe tried harder to get a hold of the host once we got into cell service, but all i had on my mind was getting the dog some medication attention asap. thanks in advance for your help. 

(also RIP stevie, hope you're painlessly frolicking in pup heaven and someone's brushing your hair and giving you tummy rubs and snackies. you were a good boy.) 

**tldr:** found what we thought was an abandoned dog in near-dead condition on a ranch. took it to the vet, had to be euthanized. turns out he belonged to the ranch owners who said they were just letting ""nature take its course"" and now they're asking me for the vet's info. should i be worried/do they have any grounds to sue me or press charges for my killing their dog??

**UPDATE:** I've reached out to Airbnb and let them know what happened so that I can post an honest review without any repercussions (although based on some comments here, it seems as if Airbnb is not favorable to the customer and usually sides with the host). I've also reached out to the clinic and got copies of 1) the Good Samaritan form I filled out upon arrival detailing his condition, the place I found him (the ranch), and his lack of identifying tags; and 2) the medical report from the vet detailing the large number of maggots and the need to euthanize him, as well as the fact that he wasn't chipped and was classified as a stray. When I spoke to the receptionist on the phone this morning, she recommended I report the issue to animal control, so I'm going to do that shortly. Still waiting to hear from Airbnb, which is concerning.

Update:
After getting in contact with my attorneys i the morning and going to the court house i found out i there is no form to remove squatters property. Essentially i was legally able to just put it in my driveway and get his car removed. However luckily the officer got in contact with the squatter and gave him my information. He came and retrieved it before i had to pay to have it all thrown out. I would have pressed charges however they were never there while the officer was they were watching the home and only came by after the officer left. I told them that if i catch them in/on my property i have a right to defend my property with lethal force and will pursue legal action against them.

I was starting to think your a nice guy but I guess you want to get the police involved. It would be a shame to expose you at work like this as well"" 

ALSO, I received a call that had my area code in it that left me a voice message!!!
I listened to the voice message and basically just said, ""Hey (my name) I'm a sheriff with (my local police department) and I have a complaint about you with so and so's daughter and her father. Please call me back ASAP.""

I have a friend who knows an undercover cop, he traced back the original numbers the guy was calling me from.. both disposables. He checked the number from the supposed police officer, disposable as well. He called it and went straight to a voice mail.

I then called my city police department to see if there were any records or complaints filed against me about anything. Not in the database at all! Then I called the police department for another town over (I was told it was where the number was from or something like that, I don't know how numbers work like that) I  talked to a Sergeant for Criminal Investigations. I told him everything that was going on, he said yeah it's a scam don't do anything. He kind of had a laugh about it.

So that's where I'm at with this right now, I also changed my phone number just to stop this shit for good. I didn't get much sleep last night, I've never been involved with something like this before. Thank you guys for helping me out, I think I would have seriously sent money to the guy if it wasn't for ya'll telling me it's a known scam.

Can a school legally harass our family. UK.," my son started his new secondary school this year. He had one morning off for a hospital appointment and one full day off for an illness. On both occasion a school van with the school logo turns up at our home asking why he's not at school despite the fact we made the school aware at the start of the day via the correct methods the school requests. Yet still they send out the staff in a fully logoed school van. It's clearly an intimidating tactic to make parents deal pressured to send children to school. I don't agree with this but see how it could work when parents don't contact the school to explain the child's abscence. 

I have told them they are not welcome to enter my garden or come to my door anymore and gave told them should they come to my home again I will contact police as it's clearly harrasment  due to being 2 or more unsolicited visits. 

The head teacher has spoke to the local authority and replied saying they don't care what I say and they will continue to use the same absence policy. My question is can they legally do this? I have not signed any forms saying I agree to this when my son joined this s",legaladvice
Update: I didn't realize I was pregnant (AZ),"Update to my post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/93zqvg/i_didnt_realize_i_was_pregnant_az/


I just wanted to thank everyone for all the advice and support. In addition to all the lawyer advice, I had people offering me diapers, baby stuff, or just someone to talk to! I haven't ever had so many people be so kind to me before. I also had a lot of people saying nasty things- those people can keep ""going their own way"", they are angry and bitter and taking it out on others.


Anyway, I just wanted to let everyone know that I am feeling a lot better, and I have a plan in place. I put in a transfer to a store in California, where my mom works. She's going to retire this fall, so she'll be able to help me out. I'll probably go there before the baby is born, even though I really like my high-risk ob-gyn here.  I blocked my ex on social media, and I blocked his number. He hasn't left any more threats in my mailbox, but if he does I will call the cops.


 I also reached out to my ex's mom, who he is estranged from. She was actually glad to hear from me, and she says she will help me out if she can. She says my ex has no business calling DCS, because he actually has an open case against him in Maricopa county. He told me he didn't see his 2 kids because his ex was being petty, but now I know there was more to that story.

Missouri. Neighbor climbing over fence with family to use my lake. I don't want him to.,"I'm chilling at my lake, on private property, in rural Missouri when suddenly a group of 4 adults and 5 small children crest over the hill carrying supplies and a wagon full of shit. Apparently my neighbor's family was in town and he intended to 'show them the lake'. I've never seen this guy before, and I've never given him nor his family permission to come on my property. 

I told them to leave and then watched as they meandered through woods and mud in order to climb over the fence where it's lowest in a wash out. It was very obvious that this wasn't a first trip.

I'm not hoarding my treasure out of selfishness; there are plenty of people who have free reign to fish or whatever, but I KNOW them, they don't bring small children, and they always ask for permission first. I'm wondering how much litter I've blamed on my friends that's just from this guy trespassing. I'm mostly concerned with liability when one of these small children drown or get shot by someone I allow to hunt here.

How can I protect myself from liability from trespassing neighbors? Or keep them out entirely? 

I've put up signage and marked trees with paint along the fence line with his property, but someone crawling over a fence probably isn't going to respect that.

Edit: Thanks all, for the great insights. I'm gonna follow through with everything except the certified letter... It wasn't a particularly aggressive interaction, and if he wants to approach me in the future to fish or whatever, he's welcome to. I just need to know when someone is on my property and who they are -- I can't have someone strolling through the woods looking for mushrooms when someone with permission is shooting a firearm.

And no kids. I don't need someone having their kid drown. I can't afford to be haunted and I don't want my dog in danger of some misguided sense of vengeance.",legaladvice
Found cash in my walls. It's mine right? Can I deposit them in the bank & pay back my student loans? (Washington),"Washington state.

I inherited a house from my uncle 3 years ago and by accident (trying to pass a cable there) I found a stack of cash hidden in the wall.

I ordered a VHS player for my computer already to see what's on the tape. But my question is whether I can take this cash to my bank and deposit them without raising suspicions? Do I need to do that $10,000 at a time, or all in one go? I want to use this to pay back my student loans which are now about $65,000.

[UPDATE][NC] Our neighbor told us he'd killed seven people. Roommate is freaking out and wants to move. What are our options here?,"Alright so things got absolutely crazy and I couldn't not update. So here's how it shook out. 

- We went to our landlord asking if there was another unit available for use to move into in the same complex because we were having some difficulties with our downstairs neighbor. (After reading over the lease requesting a room or building change is allowed for just about any reason as long as there's space available. We might have wound up with slightly higher rent but not so much higher that it would have caused financial problems). Landlord is confused, says the apartment below us is being rented by a woman not a man. We come to find out she's actually been letting him stay there against the terms of her lease. He was her boyfriend or something.

- Not entirely sure what happened next but I'm assuming landlord went and had words with her because he vanishes for two weeks. Yay!

-Come back home a couple days ago, find police cars and an ambulance in front of our building. Turns out he came back and tried to strangle her. One of her kids called 911 and the police managed to get him off of her. 

- She returns the next day. I bring her a casserole (idk it seemed neighborly?) and apologize because honestly had no idea it was going to snowball like this. She tells me not to worry, he was always kind of an abusive ass and he's definitely looking at jail time. Apparently upon doing a more thorough background check the police discovered he's been using someone's stolen identity. Three guesses what kind of warrant they found when they ran the right information? 

Her understanding it was drug related crime, so not like deliberate serial murder but more like things turning ugly in a room full of people. Either way I'm glad he's not coming back. Roomie is.... high strung but I'm optimistic that things will settle back down and she'll be able to breathe properly in about a month. I spent all night last night trying to find a news article to link to but either my google fu is weak or this somehow managed to slip under the radar of the local press. Which is a shame because I wanted proof this happened if only because this is going to be such a wild story to tell at parties.

Bra required to be worn in jail?,"Hi, legaladvice. I have a question about the way my sister is being treated after her arrest. She's in CO, at the Grand County jail. First off, she's very sensitive about the subject because of some postpartum depression and general disdain about being in the situation she's in, so I'm trying to help her out. The jail requires female inmates to wear a bra in all common areas outside her cell, which I completely understand. She has been granted permission to pump her milk 5 times a day as needed in the infirmary, and has only had one CO really give her an issue about it. It seems like that one CO is now present more often the last two weeks (schedule change?) and is making remarks toward my sis about writing her up for breaking dress code, and asking why she isn't wearing her jail-supplied bra to and from the infirmary, and so on. The CO has been getting more and more volatile about it, saying that she looks obscene, and making other inflammatory comments, from what I've heard.

&#x200B;

The issue is that the jail issue bra doesn't fit my sister's figure. She was issued a 3X and simply can't get it to fit. Is it fair that she has an extremely large chest and is being singled out for it by this asshole CO? I've been denied visitation with her because she wasn't wearing a bra she can't fit into. What can I do to help her, and more importantly, is this something to talk to a lawyer about?

Tldr; sis has experienced some breast growth due to lactation + pregnancy and is experiencing discrimination from corrections officers because she is forced to go braless. 

&#x200B;

edit: I just spoke with her this afternoon and discovered she's been expressing in the showers 2-3x a day because the 5x daily rotation is inadequate. I'll be speaking with her lawyer tomorrow to get this issue raised ASAP. Thanks to a bunch of you, I'm also speaking to them about allowing a special bra to be ordered for her while she's nursing.",legaladvice

[UPDATE] Cat sitter stole our cats: PETAL AND JAMES ARE BACK HOME!,"[Link to previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4sfn3g/help_our_cat_sitter_is_refusing_to_give_us_our/)

Thank you so much to everyone who commented and PMd me on the last thread. You have no idea how much your support meant to me and how much it lifted my spirits. 

I'm so pleased to be able to update you that **Petal and James are safely back home with us!!**

We followed everyone's advice and called up the shelter she works at and advised them of the whole situation. We told them about how her credentials as a rescuer/foster carer were originally what made us feel comfortable about using her services, that she had taken the cats and was alleging abuse, that she had failed to take Petal's eyedrops, our concerns re animal hoarding etc. and we advised them that we would be pursuing her with the police and a private lawyer.

I say ""we"", but it was really my amazing husband who made the call while I was stuck at work.

That same day, I had an awkward moment where both myself and her mother were alone together in our office kitchen so I decided to just be really forthright with her and said, ""I think you should know that [husband] and I have contacted the shelter [daughter] works for, and we've also filed theft reports with the police and have taken on a lawyer. We're also notifying animal control about the number of pets she has. It's not too late for her to stop this."" (we actually hadn't gone to the station or called a lawyer yet, but I thought it might sound more serious). 

I don't know if it was her mom or the shelter that called her and told her to do the right thing, but my son called me at work just two hours later telling me that the daughter's boyfriend had just dropped Petal and James back home. My son said the boyfriend didn't say much and he didn't seem to know much about the drama, he just left the cats in my son's care and left.

I left work immediately and came home to my babies (oh, and my son lol). 

Both were well and safe, and we saw the vet that evening and had some tests done that we're still awaiting the results for - but all in all they seem fine. Petal's eyes were fine, and the vet said its possible she had access to the drops through the shelter, so that's a small mercy.

We still haven't decided if we're going to take it further legally. We have reported her to animal control regarding her pet numbers, but her instagram and facebook have gone into privacy lockdown so I don't know if she's still keeping the hero/victim narrative going or if there have been any consequences with the shelter. 

Again, thank you so much to everyone and I hope you can all rest a little easily (like I can) knowing that James and Petal are where they belong back home with us. ",legaladvice
[SC] RA keeps interrupting sex because I'm gay,"Hi legal advice. Every time I have my bf over, without fail, the RA (who is one of my roommates) will start banging on the door and telling us to stop. Tonight we were doing homework but he still started banging on the door after 20 minutes.

[Update 2] [ME / CA] My teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.,"Thought I'd post a quick update. My attorney spoke with my ex husband's attorney, and I don't know WHAT words were exchanged, but my ex agreed to the amended custody agreement, so she no longer has to see him. He made a big stink about how he's ""not paying child support anymore"", but I'm not very worried about it. I make enough that it's not really a concern, and I've lurked this sub enough to know that just because he doesn't have visitation, does not mean he gets out of paying child support. I'm a vindictive bitch so if he's late on a single payment I plan to pursue it as far as I can. 

As far as the shitcock that assaulted my daughter, I know very little, other than it's an ""ongoing investigation"" but that they will contact me when more information is available. I'm pretty sure he's been arrested, as I received a -lovely- email from my ex-Mother in Law, rambling about how I'm destroying her grandson's life, blah blah blah. I really don't care. I've blocked her, and my daughter has all of them blocked, so as far as I'm concerned they can die in a fire at the bottom of a well.

My daughter is doing well. She's joined a ""larp"" group (sorry I don't know what it is, they play something like dungeons and dragons but in costumes with fake weapons?) and seems to be bouncing back well. Not having to deal with her father or his family anymore seems to have lifted a weight off her shoulders. She is seeing a therapist regularly, though, as I know from my own bouts of depression that just because you seem fine does not mean you are.

I wanted to extend my thanks to everyone in this sub for how supportive and kind you've been through what is a very difficult time for my family. It was very helpful to have people able to calmly and clearly explain what my options were and what to expect when I was too angry to think straight. ",legaladvice
[MD] is it legal to charge more for babysitting special needs children?,"
This morning, I went to meet a client that that I've been talking to for a few days. The son was 8 years old. He was very quiet and was messily eating his breakfast. He didn't speak a word to me and I thought he was very shy. 

The mom just told me that I would have to look after the house and feed him. And she told me the hours I had to work and I gave an hourly rate. She was doing a tour of everything and showed me his room. When I was in there I noticed a box of diapers in the corner, one diaper on the dresser and a box of wipes. I got a little concerned and asked her about it. I thought she would just say the diaper is only because of nightly bed wetting. Turns out her son has autism, he is not really verbal and not potty trained. I told her that I charge more when I have to give that much care. She got angry and said she was going to report me to the website. And that it's illegal and discriminatory to charge her more for her sons disability. 

My usual rate is cheaper than most. I only do older children that I basically just have to be in the room with. I do homework and study for classes for majority of the time. I've only had like 4-5 special needs clients and they required more care so I charge more. The other parents were upfront about the child's needs and what my duties were (diapers, hitting, spitting, bitting, cleanups, constant monitoring)  She never mentioned her son being special needs since we've been talking that's why I told her the cheaper price.

She also threatened to report me to the board of nursing, even though I didn't get hired as a CNA. I recently got my CNA, the only reason she even knows about it is because this morning as we were chatting over coffee, she had asked me about my life/college/nursing major. I just mentioned it.

Is what I did illegal? Can I be reported for something that doesn't have anything to do with my CNA? She is furious and I don't doubt she'll make as big of a fuss as she can, what can I do?",legaladvice
[update] my brother has servers autism with ID and tonic clinic seizures and an Alabama county jail is refusing to give him medication.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bd2mxy/my_brother_has_severe_autism_id_and_tonicclonic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I am on mobile but I think I got the title as close to the original as I remember. 

Sorry for the delay. It got chaotic. 

He is currently in the hospital to help stabilize his seizures and have him evaluated for other services. He is sleeping and a bit dehydrated so he is being treated for that. He seems confused. He just wants to go home to his toys. He has a collection of Pokémon figures and plushies my dad has been buying him for years. It was their thing. He loves them and takes at least one everywhere. 

It was scary when I saw him. I don't think I have ever seen him this bad since we were kids. I remember the hospital when we were little but seeing it as an adult and knowing what is going on and how it is your fault is just something else. I feel just as helpless now as I did back then only now I don't have my parents to tell me it is going to be okay. 

I called the numbers/ organizations suggested but struggled to get a hold of anyone. APS seemed to take it seriously enough but when I talked to someone they said they would get back to me Monday when I mentioned he was currently in jail. 

I ended up calling the nurse on call from his neurologist office just to see if she had any suggestions. I was told I needed to call her if he had seizures that required the diastat and I was to call each time. I figured she would want to know since I had no way of knowing how long the seizures were or if they had given him any treatment. Well I called the answering service who called the nurse who then called me back but you get the point. 

She told me she would call me back and called the doctor on call. She called back and asked for more info and the jail he was at. It took a few hours but I eventually got a call back from the nurse saying the doctor had been able to get a hold of a medical professional for the jail and long story short my brother was eventually transferred to the hospital we are at now. The nurse said she and the doctor raised hell until someone heard them out. 

I talked to a lawyer this morning who came by the hospital to visit with me and my brother. I am going to sell my truck to my uncle to cover it. I am waiting on the check now. 
He seems like a great lawyer though. He told me it would be fine. I know he met with some of the doctors earlier about my brothers intellectual capabilities. I turned over all the paperwork I had and he told me they would call when they knew something further. 

They (doctors and his state case manager)  said he will likely be transferred to a temporary nursing home when he gets discharged here if he isn't required to return back to jail. They said there he can rest and get back on his medicines. After that, we will wait for the group home to respond to his application. The case manager said it is likely  that regardless of the legal issues I would be asked to compile with their effort to find him a suitable care setting. She mentioned not thinking  he was suitable with home care and community placement with me at the moment. I agree. I just want him to be okay. I know my parents were able to care for him but I just don't know how and I can't learn at his expense. 

Now I am just tired. He is safe at the hospital and I don't think he is getting released today.
So I am going home to sleep. 

I have kept the numbers of the agencies advised in the comments in case I need to reach out to them but I am going to just let the lawyer see what he can do. 

So thankful for the nurse. I absolutely believe she was instrumental in getting him help. She could have easily just told me to wait until Monday like everyone else I spoke with. 

Answers: 

ID is intellectual disability. 

I am his guardian but he does have the GAL paperwork. It was in the stack I took to the jail. It was everything my parents had told me he would ever need in the event something happened to them. 

He hadn't been given bail yet. He was combative when he entered the jail and they said they were holding him and couldn't release him to me. When I asked about bail they said bail hadn't been set yet. I have never been in jail before so I had no idea. 

Everyone keeps asking for the county but I don't want to give it out since you could find out information on who my brother is from that. Southernish Alabama though. 

The jail guard who I think ran the front desk/phone. I am not sure what he did. But he was a big help. I am sure there wasn't much else he could do. I am forever thankful for him keeping me posted and caring what happened. 

I might not answer for a few hours. Thank you for all your advice. Especially the links to support groups/organizations. I will reach out when things settle for some advice. It really helped and it gave me places to start. Obviously this isn't over yet but it is a start. This is better than yesterday and that is something. Thank you.",legaladvice
"[OH] Trying to get my girlfriend a state ID, but can't - Final Update, 1 year later","[See here for the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5vbkez/oh_trying_to_get_my_girlfriend_a_state_id_but/).

Basically we were stuck for 15 months unable to get her an ID so that she could get a job, take classes, or get on public assistance.

The toughest challenge was proving her SSN. She never made it past 8th grade before her mom kicked her out at 14, and didn't have any actual doctor visits. Her mom had tossed all of her identifying documents (old passport, Social Security Card, birth certificate, etc). 

We tried what seemed to be everything (feel free to read the original post above).

In the end, she suffered a massive panic attack in March 2017 and I had to rush her to the hospital in West Virginia. We were assigned a case worker because they wanted to make sure I wasn't hurting her or anything, and we were lucky to have the nicest lady.

We had no way of proving my girlfriend's identity, but we gave her SSN to the case worker and she was able to look up in the system and verify that the SSN was accurate (she said that she technically wasn't allowed to do this, but wanted to help).

When my girlfriend was discharged, the case worker provided an extra form that had all of her information on it (address, SSN, etc, and again she said she wasn't supposed to do this).

We drove back to Ohio the next day and went to the BMV to try again to get the state ID.

We provided her birth certificate for proof of citizenship, a fishing license for proof of residency in Ohio, and the hospital form as a copy of medical records to prove her SSN. The worker at the BMV had their manager look at it and finally after 15 months, were able to get her an official ID.

We went to the Social Security office and ordered her Social Security Card. The next month it came in. She signed up for Medicaid and had her Emergency Room visit covered.

1 year later we're now doing great. She's working (very close by) and should be getting her actual driver license in about a month.

It's been hell but we got through it. I completely forgot to post a final update on this, but here it is. 1 year and 5 days after the last update.",legaladvice
"Husband ran up 60k debt behind my back. How will this play out in divorce court? (Ontario, Canada)","Husband an I are mid-30s, we have a 3yo and a second on the way. 

We've never had a ton of money, but we manage. I worked retail to put him through school, then went back to school myself. We have about 20k student loan debt between us, and about 6k in credit card debt. Our mailbox is a good distance away, so generally My husband picks up the mail as he drives our only car to work, while I take the train. 

I handle all the financials, pay all the bills, make sure we have an emergency fund and there's always money for groceries and gas. I also make sure we have money for entertainment. We do it this way because my husband will spend every dime he gets as soon as it hits his hands. You could give him 1000$ and it would be gone tomorrow, and he would have no idea how he spent it. While we don't live poor, we do live well within our means, and I do strive to make sure our debt is getting paid down, and am paying about 400$/month on it. My husband agreed to all of this btw. 

Monday my husband dropped off the mail for me to go through. I always open the mail because I do all the banking. Tucked into the folds of a flyer was a letter from a bank we don't use addressed to my husband. Figuring it was some junk mail, I opened it to recycle it. It was not junk mail. 

It was a statement for a credit card in my husbands name, with nearly 10k on it. When I confronted my husband, he admitted he had several cards I didn't know about. All together nearly *sixty thousand dollars* in debt. I made him show me the online statements and it's all junk food, liquor store, online gaming micro transactions, etc. Just petty bullshit with no real value. He was literally packing a lunch everyday, then tossing it at work to eat at Wendy's or the local pub. Some months were 1000$ plus per month of debt being racked up. When one card maxed out, he'd open another one and keep going. He was borrowing money from his mom to keep collections at bay, and owes her nearly 4000$ too. He was hiding it from me by controlling the mail and removing the letters before giving me the mail. He missed one because it was stuck in a flyer. 

So all of that to say, I'm definitely getting a divorce. I took our daughter and moved in with my parents.

School Requiring $15 For Students to Receive Phone Taken By a Teacher,"I'm asking this due to having this happen personally to me. Basically what happened was I was on my phone, a close family member had been having medical issues and I was keeping tabs on them. I decided that since my teacher wasn't teaching I could check my phone. Long story short she took it and sent it to the office, requiring a parent or guardian to retrieve my phone for me(pretty standard stuff for a school). My guardian came to pick it up, but the office worker said the school requires a fee of $15 to any phones brought in by a teacher. Both my guardian and I were very confused, we even asked what the funds did, the lady replied with ""the school, the students"". My guardian and I were very confused, but we paid the fee anyways. As we left the school we discussed wether what happened was legal or not. We both came upon the conclusion that their loophole had to be ""for the students"". I'm in Texas and I have friends all across the state, but not one of them have heard of their school requiring a fee like that. I was interested if anyone could explain the legality of it to me.

So, it's been a wild week. I would've posted this sooner but I was spending Thanksgiving with my (now) wife and her father. We got married this week with my (now) father in law as witness, and my father in law has now separated from my mother after learning what a insane, manipulative piece of shit she was. With this weight lifted from our shoulders, we're the typical Honeymoon phase lovebirds you'd expect...except we haven't even had our Honeymoon yet. :)

But, it's not all good news. Since my mother called me, she realized I didn't know her work number, so after my father in law told her it was over, she called me repeatedly and harassed me about how I was ""ruining her life"" and that she would file for divorce on our behalf (and insisted you all were wrong about step-siblings being allowed to marry) until I finally figured out how to block that number. She also borrowed someone else's phone and called me on that, so I blocked that number, too. She hasn't tried any other phones yet, but I expect she will until I change my number again.

My father in law is also sad over all this. He said leaving her was the smart thing to do and for the best, but he's having a hard time coping. I don't blame him, of course, but I know I'd feel like shit if I was in the same situation. At least he didn't have to see my mom at her worst.

So, thank you all for all of your advice. My wife and I are very happy about starting a family next year after we get married in our Church. I'm glad I didn't rush into marriage like my mother (she got divorced and married another guy in the same year when I was 10), and we feel we made the right call getting the marriage license out of the way now so she can start the name change process before the wedding (I've been compiling phone numbers to call since my wife is taking my last name, and I never realized just how much work this involves).

Have a great rest of your Thanksgiving, guys! :)",legaladvice
"(WV) Neighbor paints curb yellow across from driveway on public street to prevent us from parking there, then paints it white so his wife can permanently park there for weeks. They left for vacation before Christmas and painted it yellow again so we, or our guests, couldn't use it.","We live at the end of a street that wraps around and essentially becomes a rectangle with another street. Our house sits on one side of this corner/""end"" and our neighbor is directly across from us. He parks a huge RV/his truck in his driveway so his wife has to park her van around the corner on the other street instead of in his driveway.

When we moved in, there was an area outside of our front yard that the curb was clearly not painted and we used it maybe 4-5 times when we had friends visit.   This curb is directly across from his driveway. He asked us one day to not park there anymore because it was hard for his wife to get out of the driveway (whose van never moves from the spot around the corner?) and we agreed to avoid it unless we had guests. He didn't seem satisfied with our answer but left.

A day or so later we noticed that he had spray painted (literally) the curb yellow overnight so that we couldn't park there anymore. We just shrugged it off because parking isn't a huge deal and I'm not about to go to war with a neighbor over something so silly. However, a few days later he spray painted it white, then parked his wife's van there and it didn't move for weeks. They just left for vacation before Christmas and he spray painted it yellow AGAIN, parked the van in their driveway and took the truck wherever they went. This all seems super petty and dumb, but my husband parked there since they were gone last night and this morning we had a parking citation. 

Our neighbor has a ring on his door and I feel that he saw the movement, saw the parked car, and called the cops. It is painfully obvious he is spray painting the curb (different color yellow, paint sprayed into our grass, cinder blocks just sitting there so he can use them again next paint job). 

What can I do? Is this behavior even legal? How can I contest the citation?

"After I cracked the door, police pushed it open on me (VA, USA) UPDATE","[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b5q6ha/after_i_cracked_the_door_police_pushed_it_open_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app](Original Post)

Background before yesterday's post:

So, December 2018, I had a fall and fractured my wrist.  It turns out, when police forced in the door on me, combined with cuffing me, he refractured my wrist.  I've attached a report from 3/26, the day, the incident occurred.

So, to summarize:

1) I cracked the door open about 2 inches.

2) 2 police officers, with no paperwork in hand, when I asked ""what are the warrants for?""said they'd have to go check.

3) arrived at my door stating I ""may have outstanding warrants.""

4) I told them 3 times, In a runaround conversation,   me: ""what are the warrants for?"",  and they ""we don't know"" and me: ""I will call the police station and if I have warrants out I'll turn myself in"", and they: ""no ma'am you need to come with us.""

4) Upon my fourth request for the warrants and statement I'd turn myself in, an officer pushed the door open on my body by force, with my right hand on the door.

5) that same officer, agitated, then cuffed me by force, although I didn't resist.

6)! During this time, my right wrist was refractured.

7) During this time I was a female in under pants and t shirt, which I had already mentioned to them repeatedly.

8)  I stated I had some warrants three weeks ago but did not mention that I added already been arraigned on the charges (meaning quite a bit of time for the paperwork to update passed I had been arraigned a full week earlier).

9) The officer who forced the door asked for my SSN.  After some calm questions I provided it.

10) After radioing in my info, I was  uncuffed, as it was discovered I had turned myself in 3 weeks before for these warrants.  The officer apologized ""it had to go this way.""  I indicated that I've been researching my rights as a citizen and I had no idea they could burst in that way.

11) the officers left with polite pleasantries.  

12) shortly after the adrenaline wore off, I noticed the pain in my wrist.  

13) later that say I went to a local medexpress and found my wrist had been refractured.

So, with no warrant and ultimately asking for nothing more than my SSN, officers broke my wrist forcing my door in on me with not a stitch of paperwork allowing them to do so.

I'm beyond angry.  I cannot believe that these cops could behave so egregiously they not only completely ignored the 4th amendment but they basically started me completely over on the healing of my wrist.

I sued Equifax and won. They filed an appeal. What's next?,"I'm in California and I sued Equifax via small claims court and got my judgement at end of October.  From what I've read, Equifax has 30 days before I can start collecting.

However, a couple weeks ago they've served me an appeal but the service paper does not have a new court date.  The service paper said to not contact the small claims court and the court will contact me.  How long do I wait?

Update:
- I checked my case status and got this
https://imgur.com/a/Ve7m4

Does this mean the court rejected the appeal?  Oh nevermind, Equifax probably just didn't pay for their appeal.  But does that mean they didn't file within 30 days so they're SOL?

Judgement was on 10/25 so did Equifax screwed up?

https://imgur.com/a/wU0eh

Update for new comers:

- Judgement is $360 + court fees on 10/25.

- Equifax served me Appeal on 11/8 via USPS.

- Clerk sent rejection letter for non payment of filing fees on 11/15

- It's been more than 30 days, time to collect?!?!

- The main basis of my case was that I should be able to choose my own credit monitoring service rather than use a service that's ran by Equifax, the company who lost my data in the first place.  The service offered by Equifax does not fully cover all credit bureaus in the US. They admit it as well and it's on their service description.

- Sounds to me like this won't fly as well in Civil court so I will probably try to find a legal angle to this.

- Obviously if I do come up with any argument I may not post it here since Equifax may be reading, sorry guys.  I'm only disclosing what I've already disclosed prior to today.

- Step by step process will be reserved for when I do get to collection to not encourage others to follow suit.  While I welcome what's to come, it may not be in your best interest and like others have said, even I might be in over my head.  Oh well.

- Worse case scenario, I lose $150 to Equifax for court fees due to:
> Code of Civil Procedure sections 116.780 and 116.790. Section 116.780(c) provides that the court may award the winning party attorney's fees actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the appeal, but not exceeding $150 (as well as lost earnings and transportation/lodging expenses not exceeding an additional $150). Section 116.790 allows the court, if it finds the appeal ""was without substantial merit and not based on good faith, but was intended to harass or delay the other party, or to encourage the other party to abandon the claim,"" discretion to award the other party actual, reasonable fees that do not exceed $1,000 (as well as an additional $1,000 in lost earning and transportation/lodging expenses).",legaladvice

[UPDATE] I euthanized my Airbnb host's dog.,"[Original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/94vkbg/found_an_abandoned_dog_while_on_vacation_and_had/)

Firstly, I wanted to thank everyone who replied to my original post with such kind and encouraging words. Unfortunately, this is a very boring and uneventful update, but I've had several messages about the incident in the last couple weeks so I figured I'd post something real quick. 

In short, I contacted Airbnb about the issue to 1) make sure they wouldn't take down my honest review once I posted it and 2) to see if they could talk to the host about the clear animal welfare concern. They assured me of both and gave me a $25 coupon for my trouble (lmao). My review went up last week. The host didn't write me a review.

I also contacted the vet to get records of the incident, and the receptionists I spoke with were incredibly sweet. They told me, off the record, that I should contact animal control about these folks, so I did. 

I called every animal control center within 50 miles of the place, and all of them told me the place I stayed wasn't within their jurisdiction so they wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Even when I said, ""But the place is in X County, and you're the animal control office for X County..."" they'd say, ""Well the address doesn't come up in our directory, so maybe try calling the Y County Animal Control."" It was super fucking frustrating and I ultimately wasn't able to have anyone go out and speak to the owners. However, even if they had, they would have found a thriving farm full of healthy animals, and I doubt anything would have happened. My theory is no one was willing to drive out into the desert over an animal that was already dead. 

So, that's kind of that. My review is so long I doubt anyone will read it, and they get so many visitors it'll just get shuffled down very quickly as new positive reviews pour in. But it was the least I could do. Hopefully I spooked them into taking better care of their animals in the future. ",legaladvice

So it's been about ten months since this issue. Although I wasn't able to make any legal impact on the situation, there have been some changes that I thought warranted an update.

The situation really didn't sit well with me so I wrote several complaint letters to the head of the hostel, the dean of my school, and the provost of my college. They were largely ignored or I was given non-committal answers about why that happened to us. I think I wore them down eventually, because they all agreed to meet with me.

Honestly it was very intimidating, having to meet all the heads of my school. There was a lot of pressure on me to back down, because it is unheard of to question superiors like that, especially as a woman. A senior lecturer even advised me personally to do so, or else my career would be over before it started. I nearly did, but I swallowed my fear and went through with it. The meeting was in late May, before we ended that academic year.

I had been gathering anonymous, handwritten opinions about the situation from my classmates and presented them to the panel. I stressed a lot on how I personally struggled with accommodation on such short notice and how the general maintenance of the rooms is the responsibility of the university, as outlines in their rule book.

They told me that painting rooms is only supposed to happen after five years, that the rooms weren't even that dirty to begin with. I had some pictures of some rooms before they were painted (they were originally white but at that point mostly brown with patches of grey, several rooms also had stains from where water had leaked into the room from the roof).

Amazingly, after about two hours of discussion, they decided to stop making students paint rooms by themselves, and are currently amending their policy to paint every year instead of twice a decade. However, they refuse to refund the money we spent painting the rooms, claiming that the painters weren't hired by the university and we the students weren't given receipts so they cannot trust any price we quote.

While I'm not happy about loosing 80 cedis, I'm proud that I've made an impact and stood up. Maybe someone else will have more success.

Cop Pulls Wife Over (AGAIN),"Previous Story: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9xn1ni/a\_cop\_pulled\_over\_wife\_and\_gave\_her\_3\_tickets\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9xn1ni/a_cop_pulled_over_wife_and_gave_her_3_tickets_and/)

This isn't an update. Yesterday the cop that pulled my wife over a few months ago pulled her over again yesterday. We have paid all of the tickets that were given to her and got her license squared away. The problem I have is that my wife wasn't speeding, was wearing her seatbelt, was driving her sister's car and the officer pulled her over again. When he got to the window he called my wife by her last name and asked, ""Did you get your tickets and license taken care of?"" and then proceeded to run her information. Since everything was good to go he let her go. I have a couple of concerns about this and you guys were so helpful last time. We are in Austin, TX (Williamson County)

&#x200B;

1. Is this even a legal stop? Can a cop pull over someone to check their ticket/license status and not for any other reason?
2. My wife was driving her sister's car so the cop didn't recognize the car, he recognized her and even called her by her last name. This seems extremely creepy and weird and I don't know if its acceptable behavior for a police officer.
3. Should we be worried about him pulling her over in the future and at what point is it considered harassment?
4. What should our next steps be?

Update: Thanks everyone for answering the questions. I appreciate the differences of opinions. That is one of the reasons I posted on here. I understand that he is doing his job and that may require different things. I will be getting a dash cam as soon as possible and will keep things recorded to ensure her safety.

Repeatedly, my landlord informed me that the owner wants to ""look"" at the thermostat. I've always feigned not knowing about it. When I first set it up, I had to de-register the last user, who I thought was the previous tenant, not the owner.

I consider this private information, as the schedule of cooling and heating indicates when I'm at home. It would also reveal any vacations away from my apartment, unless I just waste money to keep the apartment cool.

Most recently, the landlord told me the owner now wants to see the thermostat (I assume re-register as the user) under threat of stopping internet service. I have not yet responded to my landlord. I have never met, seen, or talked to the owner.

Internet service is among the lease requirements, but I suppose he could downgrade it to something unusable.

AFAIK, thermostat control is not required to be in his name. Furthermore, it just seems way more reasonable for me, the tenant, to have sole access to that info.

What throws this into murky waters is that I understood the lease I signed to be demonstrative and not ""real"", as part of a tenant application process - that the real lease would be signed after I was approved.

I was hesitant to sign this electronic lease, and only did so after asking, via phone call, the landlord to email me saying the lease was not real. She replied ""dates are wrong [in the lease]"" in an email.

I decided it was enough since I was in a rush to move in, so I went with it anyways.

Later I called her after being approved to find out when the real lease signing was to take place. She said, as a matter of fact, the first one was already real.

Any ideas if this is worth pursuing? I think it's silly for the owner to need this thermostat more than I do.",legaladvice
"Apparently, I'm running an art cartel.","This is ridiculous, my lawyer is out of town until the weekend.  Until I see him, is there anything specific I should worry about with this whole craziness?

Small tourist town, Pennsylvania. I run a gift shop that has a small gallery space for local artists work.  Two friends own art galleries within three blocks.  We work together to run promotions similar to ""first Friday"" in larger cities.  We also split advertising in flyers showing each of our current showing.  Mostly though, we will recommend the other galleries as each of us has a different proffered art type.

A guy moved into the area who owned a high end gallery in a city, who Ill call John.  Opens a small gallery in town as his retirement job.  We reached out to him to try to include him in the local arts community, but he turned us down rudely.  John has been doing poorly.  From my perspective it's because most of the work he shows is priced out of the local market and he tends to act rudely to customers.

He has become antagonistic towards us.  John has started posted ads that attack us for not having ""real art"", etc.  He has been quite vocal about badmouthing us to anyone who comes in his gallery.  So far, we have just let him bury himself in bad business practices and haven't responded in any way.

However, things came to a head this weekend, The other galleries and I held a promotion in conjunction with Halloween festivities and parade on Friday.  He was seen pulling down our flyers around town last week.  Most local shops stayed open late that night and had sales or promotions, but John's gallery was noticeably closed the entire day Friday and Saturday.  In the morning Sunday John posted on his personal Facebook saying the  other local galleries trashed his shop front. Later in the day a local police officer came by to ask me about it.  I know the police officer and he basically said the pictures he was shown were candy wrappers and litter by the door, similar to what was left all along the parade route.  The officer said he had no reason to think we were involved or that it was malicious, but he wanted to follow up and settle the issue.

I was told the next day John posted and then deleted numerous complaints on Facebook against other local businesses, but especially me and the other three galleries.  He has even given us a nickname, which sounds like an old west group (think ""The Three Banditos""). I can't see John's posts but was sent two screenshots and told there was worse.  On Monday, two of my friends galleries had printed flyers taped to their doors overnight, blasting them for selling cheap art and for pushing new galleries out of the community.  I'm told there were also angry posts on Facebook saying that an artist who had decided to pull from his gallery, which he blamed on us.  None of us know this artist, nor had any contact.

Which brings us to this morning.  I get a call saying that John was at a local coffee shop trying to get people to give him money to mount a lawsuit against us. He apparently had a document he typed up with his grievances. He is claiming that I specifically am running an art cartel!  (Hence the post title). That two of the other shops have flooded the market with low end art to destroy his business.  John was hassling patrons for money so much he was asked to leave before cops were called.

I think Johns business is doing poorly and he is going a little crazy. I think the worst he could do is drag us into a pricey lawsuit that goes no where, but I want to make sure there's no other trouble he could make for us. Is this dire enough to bring in a lawyer before I speak to mine on Tuesday?

Slight update:  One of the gallery owners who had something taped to their food Monday met with their lawyer today.  He let me know his lawyer is writing a cease and desist.  His lawyer passed along similar recommendations to here:  collect any evidence, get a security camera, and see if this blows over.  I'm still meeting w my lawyer Tuesday, and have people friended to John in Facebook watching for any new posts.  I'm probably going to just see if my lawyer will also do a cease and desist, but otherwise I'm just going to stay back and watch.

Adding: I posted this on a throwaway to have some anonymity.  I've gotten 17 guesses as to my town or gallery.  Understand I know that can only lead to harassment of John, so I'm definitely not going to give away any more information.",legaladvice

Not too exciting but an update none the less.

Not long after the original post I ended up sending an email to my landlord with a copy of the letter from the HOA and explained my situation. The next day I received a phone call from my landlord and she said not to worry about it. According to her despite my lease stating that the ""Tenant agrees to abide by any applicable owners association regulations as they now exist or may be amended."" this was a rather unreasonable demand by the HOA and isn't something that should be held against me or any other tenants she has in the neighborhood. She said she would take care of the situation with the HOA and offered to pay any fines that resulted in the meantime.

As of today I have received another letter from the HOA that said until further notice they will not be enforcing the rule regarding parking of vehicles older than 10 years old.

I haven't received any violations from the HOA up to this point and have yet to hear anything else from my landlord.

I'll update again when I know more and the situation has been resolved.",legaladvice
Landlord left door unlocked with a note saying so. Everything of value was stolen.,"I reported a maintenance issue to my landlord and he scheduled a repair person to come last Friday.  The landlord asked me to be there, I told him I couldn't, he asked me to leave the door unlocked, I told him I couldn't.  I asked him to be there for the repair, and he agreed.

He apparently came over late Thursday and unlocked the door, then put a note on it to the company literally SAYING the door was unlocked and asking them to lock it when they leave. 

I arrived home on Saturday night to find that the company never actually showed up and the door had been unlocked the whole time.  Everything of value was stolen and a number of things that weren't valuable were still broken/vandalized. 

I filed a police report. Then, since my landlord had agreed to be there for the repair person, I contacted him thinking he must have forgotten to lock up.  That's when I learned that he just came over and unlocked it a day early and left it that way.

I know it has only been a day, but so far my landlord takes no responsibility with what happened and I am afraid that won't change.  Is there anything legal I can do?

I need to go through the purchases but I believe the total amount of items stolen and items damaged is about $15,000 that I paid.

(It won't be covered by rental insurance, BTW, already looked into it.)

I Need a Way Out,"so, recently New York passed a law mandating vaccination from all children wishing to go to public school. And thank god, frankly. But unfortunately, my mother is antivaxx. Meaning I am not vaccinated. I've been out of school for about a week now and it's my Junior year of Highschool. I have 7 siblings, one working father and a BPD mother. Needless to say, no actual homeschooling will be happening. I'm not here to throw my future away, but my mom insistent that a stay on the law will happen that she has no plan to move us! Today she suggested I do online schooling, which wouldn't be so bad if that didn't mean I would be stuck at home 24/7 parenting my siblings because neither of my parents are emotionally capable of parenting. I told my parents, if they don't have a plan to get me to Maryland ( with my abuela ) so I can go to public school, I will leave myself. I have a place I am able to go to in the case of me leaving on my own terms, but unfortunately I cannot enroll anywhere or do anything without the permission of my legal guardians; not without emancipation. But the problem with that is that I would have to notify my parents and go to court, and also provide money to pay for it. And I need out as soon as possible before I miss more and more school. Is there anyway I can cut ties with my parents without court hearings?? Leaving asap???

Debt Collectors chasing me for friends debts,"My old best friend had a breakdown,  got together with a toxic partner and ended up addicted to drugs and accruing alot of debt 4 years ago. 

She has listed my address,  mobile number and home phone number as either her contact details or as me as a reference to her debt.  The calls started in 2015 and continued for around 6 months. She didn't have a mobile at that stage so I notified her via messenger and requested she resolve the issues.  This didn't work so I notified her parents and asked that they deal with it.  They gave me permission to pass their numbers onto the Collectors.  

Last month,  new collectors have started again I'm assuming with new debt.  I inform them the details she's supplied is incorrect,  I no longer have contact with her and to stop contacting me.  They've refused to remove my details from their files and continue to contact me - at this stage there is 4 different agencies chasing me for her.  

I'm concerned the implications this may have on my credit file in the future - moving isn't an option nor is changing my information.  

Is there any thing I can do legally to stop her doing this?

"[Nevada] HOA says we're violating ""single family"" clause. We're siblings living together, also not a member of HOA at all. They also want our pool removed & limit us to 2 cars. They have signatures to have us join!","Ok I don't even know where to begin.

Me and my two sisters inherited this property from our grandparents. It was their rental property. We demolished and rebuilt everything from scratch for ourselves to use as the main home for our family. We built a pool and a sauna. We live here now.

During construction the HOA president visited me and told us that that our design violates HOA's renovation guidelines. He also said that the pool and sauna are violations of the bylaws. I reminded him that we're not members of the HOA and have no interest in joining.

In the last 6 months we've received numerous letters from the HOA either compelling us to join or inform us of our infractions. They're either about the pool, about the fact that we have 3 cars, or that we're not a single family (apparently brothers and sisters are not family now according to this HOA).

We also received letters saying if we join the HOA the fees will be waived for the next 5 years.

This last week though the president brought us a form showing that there has been 45 signatures by the neighbors saying our way of life and our non-compliance with the HOA bylaws has significantly devalued their properties and has cost them stress and they would want us to become a member. The president says this is enough to get a court order requiring us to become a member. He says the neighbors will be willing to testify in court as well. He says to avoid the legal fees on both our parts, he's willing to give us the 5 year waiver of the fees.

First I have no intention of joining this HOA. They've proven themselves to be exactly the type of HOA to not want to be associated with.

Second, is it true that a court can order you to join a HOA? This seems weird. Are they bullying us into joining?

"[Indiana] Landlord pulls rental agreement when he meets me for the first time, refuses to refund my $100 application fee, I think it's because I'm black.","I found a great place on Craigslist several weeks ago that was going to be available on Tuesday. When I called, the guy was very polite, talked me through everything, sent me the link to the rental application on his website, made everything really simple. I did some research myself to make sure it was all above board, being on Craigslist and all, and the phone number and website definitely match up to the property owner. There's no office since it's only a 16 unit building but the guy is locally known for owning it. It definitely isn't a ""meet me at starbucks with cash/money order"" type of apartment listings, it's real.


Since I live out of state I knew I wouldn't be able to see the inside of it first, but a friend who lived in the same building a couple of years ago said they've just been renovated and he confirmed the pictures were what I could expect. Great! Send in the application and $100 admin fee, he contacts the place I rent from now, gets my credit and calls my work. A week later he emails me and says that everything came back good, he'd just need the first month of rent and a $250 deposit on the day I move in.


Fast forward to yesterday and I meet the owner there at 10 am. I tell him my name and he goes ""The same (my name) who I've been talking to at (my phone number)"" Yep that's me. ""And your email address is (my email address)?"" Yes it is. And he just stood there for about 10 seconds looking at the paperwork and said he'd be right back. He went to his car and I think he got on the phone. Maybe 5 minutes later he comes back and says ""I'm sorry, but there's been a mistake, your credit came back unsatisfactory, you can't have the apartment""


When I told him I don't have any loans - student or car, and I pay my credit card off every month so I can't possibly have bad credit he just said ""Sorry, it's not available"" as he's basically jogging back to his car at this point. He just drove off, I'm standing there alone flabbergasted, what the hell just happened?


As I'm driving to my friends house to help him clear some space in his garage for my furniture, which is now on its way with the movers and I have to change the delivery address, it hits me. This guy hadn't seen me before, my name is something very common so he couldn't have known what I look like. He just lied to me and refused to rent to me, after he said everything was fine, because I'm black.


When I emailed him demanding the $100 fee back he replied back with ""Sorry, that fee is non-refundable"" I'm out nearly $1000 from the movers, the $100 for the admin fee and I'm probably going to have to take the first thing I can find apartment-wise because I don't want to be a burden to my friend in his guest bedroom.

LA was right...it was a cat scam (update to pet theft accusations) PA,"Recap. Years ago I took in an injured kitten. Earlier this year I was connected on social media by someone claiming to be the original owner. They demanded return of the kitty and I ignored them. They then escalated to sending letters to my home.

Some LA posters thought it might have been a scam. I was sceptical because they hadn't asked for money even after things had dragged on for a while. Well, I guess they were playing the long con because I just got my first letter suggesting a few hundred dollars might just assist the ""owner"" to move on from their loss.  As a bonus, it was sent on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office. If I don't pay the cat fee they plan to sue. My favorite part is that they don't specify for what, exactly. They're just going to sue.  You know, like lawyers do.

 I'm still kinda worried they might try to steal kitty and demand a ransom (kitty is indoor only, chipped, and rarely left alone...on days I do have to work in office I've been taking him in with me.) But yeah, I'm thinking this is one of the weirder catfishing schemes on record. 

I tried to tell kitty about his custody dispute, but he just yawned in my face and joined his big brothers for a celebratory afternoon nap. Though he did hack up a hairball on my pillow yesterday...paying someone else to take him is starting to look pretty tempting.

UPDATE+QUESTIONS - My ex wife's boyfriend is abusing my kids and the custody hearing isn't until after I'm supposed to bring them back,"[Michigan, USA]

**Question 1:** My lawyer is telling me to be prepared for my ex to say I abused the kids and coached them to lie. Is there anything I can do to get out in front of that? 

**Question 2:** I wouldn't be surprised if the boyfriend has been abusing my ex wife. My lawyer said if this is the case she might use that as a defense for not stepping in when the kids were being beaten mercilessly by a grown adult man. If this surfaces does it help or hurt my efforts to keep the kids in my custody? 

See below for a link to my original post and an update on where we are right now.

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/87pnd0/my_exwifes_boyfriend_is_abusing_my_kids_and_my/?st=JFC4AIH0&sh=3ae41f39

My lawyer agreed he didn't have the background to handle this case and connected me to a different lawyer with experience in these cases and family court, who is also being very generous with her rates.

In the meantime my ex wife arrived out of nowhere to try and take the kids back. I hadn't gone into the driveway yet and the kids were tuned into their iPads with headphones on so we went on a spontaneous ice cream run. 

CPS is heavily involved and *six* separate reports were made (originally I had written five but I forgot my first lawyer also filed a report at the instruction of my new lawyer). So, his, mine, my new lawyer's, the ER doctor, the police who were called to the ER, and their school counselor (at the advice of my new, far more aggressive, lawyer.) The reports are almost definitely what backed the judge into the corner of having to grant the hearing. 

I'm too nervous to sleep. The boys slept some. They seem a bit calmer. 

Hoping for good news and **thank you for all the good advice**. I now see I really needed that new lawyer and filing the multiple reports and getting an exam was the best course of action.

**UPDATE**: Thank you all for your excellent advice. My lawyer is aware that I'm posting on here and said it's alright - especially since she recognizes she can't make herself as available as she would if I were a regular client through her firm paying full freight. She's been wonderful. 

The hearing was pushed back by a couple hours but we can't leave in case they can see us sooner so we're waiting now. I'm exceptionally freaked out but my lawyer seems deeply confident it will be open and shut. (The case worker isn't visiting the house until this afternoon but apparently she's already visited my ex's house and talked to the boyfriend and her conclusion from that was to recommend they stay with me.)

The boys have had some interviews and exams with CPS that sound like they went as well as they could have and the things that didn't go well will help me get them home and safe. 

After this process my next step is an order of no contact on the boyfriend or a restraining order if I can swing it. Will have to ask the lawyer. But she agrees we do need something official in place to keep him at bay. 

A buddy is installing a couple security cameras today. Thanks for those who recommended that.

**ANOTHER UPDATE** 

I have custody until the formal hearing is scheduled. I don't have to bring them back. Their lawyer tried to say the younger one had fallen on cement and rolled down a step and that's how it happened. When the boys were asked if younger fell and they had no clue what she was talking about (they tripped on some patio bricks but were barely scratched) their lawyer tried to switch it around and say I'd abused them and they were trying to do me a favor of keeping it out of court. 

The judge said ""Counselor, are you out of your mind?"" Which my lawyer says is a great sign moving forward. I don't know where they found their lawyer but he was wearing sneakers. 

So now we wait for next Wednesday. I'm just relieved there isn't the same clock on it now. Thank you again to everyone. 

The boys are back in school Monday and doing well. The older fell asleep tonight without issue for the first time since I got them. I'm hopeful. 

**UPDATE April/11/18** Sorry for the long delay. It's been a crazy few days, I've barely been checking my emails let alone Reddit (as wonderful as you all are!) Your support has been so critical in getting through this time. 

So - at first I did not win full custody. My ex wife and her bizarre lawyer fabricated evidence claiming I'd been fired from a previous job for violence, going so far as to forge a letter from a nonexistent boss and a whole hash of lies. (I am in IT. So I really don't know what she could have dreamed up that would end in physical violence.)  

I was just so flustered and terrified at the initial ruling. My lawyer hadn't seen the fake papers and was a complete shark, not allowing anyone to even leave the courtroom before she understood the reasoning behind the ruling. 

Once it came to light there was some sort of evidence she hadn't seen she really dug in and at the end of the day I got full custody with my ex getting limited supervised visits (provided the boyfriend is nowhere in sight) and the chance to come back and get more visits if she can demonstrate the boyfriend is no longer living in the house or would ever be around the kids. The other good news is it seems like the only plus to icky sneakers lawyer is that he is helping her seek some counseling for whatever trauma she personally experienced. 

My lawyer is following up with seeing anyone responsible for misconduct, including the judge,  is dealt with appropriately. 

I have the kids now. That's all that matters. They're still in school in her town (where I lived with her when we were married) and the end of the year is close but next year I'm going to move them to my district.

It's all on her now. All that matters is the boys are home. ",legaladvice
Teacher terrified kids into donating to a religious establishment. Any grounds to get their money back? (KY),"My children attend a public school in a rural, heavily religious area of the state. 

I recently learned my kids donated all their money (son, over 200 bucks/ daughter, over 100) to a local church because one of their teachers went around telling the school kids those who don't donate will burn in hell, suffer great pain, and surely die soon. I found out because my kids came crying to me after doing so wanting to know if they were still going to die because the teacher said they hadn't donated ""enough.""

I'm absolutely furious. We're an atheistic household and while I respect the teacher's choice to partake in religion, I'm outraged she's been saying these things to my kids and extorting them out of their hard-earned chore money. 

I've talked to the school, but I don't think there is a single person in administration who isn't religious. No one is taking this seriously and when I went to complain, they praised the teacher and informed be (bragged) that she forces kids to listen to her read the bible aloud in the lunchroom during lunch breaks.

Neighbors keep using our water even after we told them not to. (California),"Im posting this question for my cousin who live in SoCal, any help would appreciate.


Several months ago, we noticed our neighbor was using our water from our garden hose mid evenings (about2-3am) I spoke to the homeowner who explained they were in a rough situation and needed water for hygiene use and for their child. They have ""tenants"" and the homeowner assured me it was just for themselves and child so I agreed they could temporarily use it so long as the other do not. 

One day I came home and saw one of the ""tenants"" using it broad daylight. As I approached person drops it, shuts it off, apologizes, and says they wont do it again. 

Few days later we hear water again at 3 am. As my husband approaches, person scurries into their home. He proceeded to knock on their door to ask them never to use it again. Another neighbor (lives down the street) comes out of the home explaining they were under the impression they could use it because I said so. He didn't understand why this person was there at the time of night or why they were getting involved but he made it clear they are no longer to enter our property or steal our water. Person relays message and assures us it wont happen again. We were good for several months since then. 

Last week, I started noticing things again, and last night woke to the sound of running water. My husband went out, but this time instead of being apologetic, this person acted entitled telling us that we should allow him to use the water for several reasons. My husband was insistent he stop and he eventually shut the valve off and left. My husband is certain this person is related to the the others somehow. I'm not as certain since he proceeded to walk down the street. My husband thinks it was a ploy so as not to attract another police presence in their home.

We live in a very quiet neighborhood except for the one house on the block. They are frequented by WCPD. And the inhabitants are quite shady, I'm trying to balance enforcement of our property rights with possibility of attracting harm from them especially with our children in mind. They have known gang affiliations and the PD can't seem to do much about it. So I am trying not to provoke anything from them either.

99% of the homes on our street are not gated. We are seriously considering gating it now because we have 3 young children.

Is there anything else we can do about this? People keep telling is to call cops, but I doubt water theft is a high priority. 😔",legaladvice
"Stopped for a broken headlight, I now sell drugs.","Location: Long Island, NY

As the title says I was stopped Friday, 6/15/18, at 11:05pm for a broken headlight. The cop asks for my license and registration, after a half hour, he tells me, ""I'm doing you a favor by not bringing you in, your license has been suspended for selling drugs."" I was baffled, at first I laughed out of disbelief, and then was quickly informed that it was not a joke.

My charges are as follows:

* FLD/SURR/LIC/REG PLATES/REV-ART7 (MISD)
* DIVERS VIEW OBSTRUCTED
* NO/INADEQUATE LIGHTS
* OPERATING WITHOUT INSURANCE
* UNLICENSED OPERATOR
* AGGRAVATED UNLIC OP 3RD (MISD)

I'm claiming guilty to my inadequate lights and obstructed view, I had my graduation tassel hanging from my mirror. I'm certain this is a clerical mistake as there are many people with the same name where I live. Because I didn't know my license was suspended for a crime I didn't commit I received charges that I otherwise wouldn't have. I've prepared the following pieces of information in my defense:

* Pay stubs prior to the crime to prove my work hours of 8:00am to 5:00pm.
* Gym check-in's Monday through Friday from the hours of 6:30pm to 8:00pm.
* Driving history.
* Proof of insurance.
* My clean criminal history aside from the alleged crime, leading to my license suspension.

My question to you guys is, what do I do from here? I'm looking for a lawyer before attending my court date in August, is there any way to clear this up prior to the court date? If you've taken the time to read this, THANK YOU!

TLDR: Cop stopped me and informed me that I committed a crime that I didn't. I was not brought to jail.

Something more interesting than that, I have three felony charges and two charges of reckless driving in my history.

One of these charges being (6) months after I had passed my drivers test, so I've been driving without an active license for years now.

* SUSPENSION: 11/01/13 (I was 22 and in my sophomore year of college, and nowhere near the alleged location), FOR THE POSSESSION OR SALE OF DRUGS.  
The above suspension means I have been driving without an active license for five years now

"[UPDATE] [IL/NV] Paid an artist for a painting, never received it, artist won't respond to emails...","Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5mo5wh/ilnv_paid_an_artist_for_a_painting_never_received/

So, nearly two years after a gallery owner/artist took our money and never sent us the artwork we bought, we now have the artwork in possession, and the artist/gallery owner is in a world of trouble.

First, how we retrieved the artwork: after the previous legaladvice thread, we spoke to a friend who was a lawyer in Chicago, who suggested we contact the landlord of the building, which we were able to do successfully.  The landlord office manager noted the artwork was hanging in their public space (in a hallway, not in the gallery), so they contacted the artist who continued to not respond (although he was paying his rent) about the situation, and informed him if he didn't respond they'd take the painting into their possession.  He didn't respond, so the landlord removed the artwork and stored it in the basement where it sat... for over a year...

Meanwhile, my wife reported the artist/gallery owner to the Dept. of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, who ended up charging the guy with operating without a business license ($1000/day!!!), as well failure to deliver the merchandise in a timely manner.  The guy apparently doesn't read this subreddit, and decided to take the ostrich road and not show up for the case, so he got the maximum penalty due to a default judgement...  of $28,000 (plus the $1200 he owed us).  Fun!

A few months after the judgement, I was in Chicago for business for the first time in 2 years, so I made arrangements with the landlord to pick up the painting.  I ended up renting a moving van (the thing is huge) and then getting it to a UPS Store who packed it up and got it back to our home!  So we finally have the painting in hand!

Final fun: I was worried that since I now had the painting in hand, that I was no longer due the $1200 should the Chicago collections ever get it, so I contacted the prosecutor of the case to be as open as possible.  I told her that we had the merchandise in hand, but I had spent basically ~$1200 shipping it back home.  She said basically ""don't worry about it.""  

So, all told, a good ending to a long story.  If we magically get a check in the mail someday for $1200 (not holding my breath) I'll post another update.

Edit: TLDR, gallery owner/artist ripped us off for $1200, we got the painting without his help, he got a penalty from the City of Chicago for nearly $30,000.",legaladvice
"[Update] A bit late, but here's my update","[This was my original inquiry](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4yj8ar/advice_for_presenting_evidence_in_a_minor_traffic/)


My court date was actually last November so I'm quite late on the update, just had it on my check-list until now. 


Basically I went to court and claimed not guilty. They gave me a reduced fine and said it was a one-time offer. I said not guilty. They gave me a follow-up court date, which was the one in November. 


On that day, my ticketing officer did show up. At first, some of the court people were asking me if I was absolutely sure that I wanted to fight the ticket and if I was open to claiming nolo claim with a reduced rate. This was the same reduced fine that they presented me on my first court date, where they said it was a one-time offer. I said no and asked what the possible fines were if I was found guilty. The lady quoted me the maximum, which was like a **lot** of jail time and like $2,000 in fines or something. I still claimed not guilty. In hindsight I feel like she was trying to scare me into going nolo? Not sure. 


The court lawyer lady (not sure what she's called now that it has been so long) asked him questions to help him present his case on my ticket. Very reminiscent of TV court rooms, confirming dates, times, and details. 


When I presented the evidence, I didn't allude to my background or anything, as per suggestion from /r/legaladvice. Basically I just said: 



- The officer providing ground guidance for vehicles was unclear in his instructions

- There were multiple people ticketed for the same turn at the intersection

- The ticketing officer was not present or in the vicinity when the other officer was providing ground guidance



I did not sound very... er.... lawyer-y, but I didn't use slang, curse words, or anything like that. I was basically speaking like I was presenting a PhD thesis. The judge confirmed that the officer providing ground guidance was not present and that the ticketing officer did not see the other officer guide traffic. He then said at that point, it's basically a ""he said, she said"" situation and he would rule in my favor because the police side lacked evidence to prove that there wasn't any bad guidance from the other cop. 


Just wanted to thank you guys. Your advice helped a lot and to be frank, I feel like a basic understanding of law should be taught in school because in hindsight, I feel like they were trying to intimidate me several times into a nolo claim and paying the fine. ",legaladvice
UPDATE: Student's mother found out I was abused as a teen and is now telling everyone I'm a danger to the kids. I might lose my job. [NY],"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3y3b7m/students_mother_found_out_i_was_abused_as_a_teen/)

Let me start by thanking everyone who took the time to give me advice and answer my questions in the previous post. That was a very helpful starting point. There were a few requests for updates so here we go. 

Many of you suggested that I contact an attorney to write her a letter, which is exactly what I did. He said if I *really* wanted to pursue this with a lawsuit, I might be able to. But to be honest, I'd much rather not spend the time and resources if I don't have to, especially since my last court experience was less than great. I'm not looking for a big payout. I just want to move forward with my life. 
 
I asked my boss if we could set up a time to meet since we're technically closed this week. I knew she was aware of the situation since this woman had posted on our facebook page which my boss manages, but I wasn't really sure where my boss stood on the issue, so I was pretty anxious going in. I told my boss about my visit with the lawyer and about the letter he was going to send her. Turns out, she had a lawyer friend of hers do the exact same thing on behalf of the business. So this woman got not one, but two letters ordering her to shut the hell up, from two different lawyers. Hopefully that is enough to scare her into keeping her mouth shut. 

She told me to just avoid this lady at all costs. Like if I run into her at the grocery store, turn around. Her daughter is still taking classes with another teacher during a time when I'm not working. She said she knows this woman is batshit crazy and if she thought there was any real concern regarding me being around kids she would have fired me. She also said she thinks I've been doing a great job handling this and that overall the kids and parents respond really well to me and she's glad to have me on her staff. Always nice to hear and at this point it looks like my job is not in jeopardy. 

The facebook posts have been deleted. Not sure if Facebook did it after I reported them, or if she did it herself. Hopefully this is the last you'll be hearing from me. Big thanks to the community for your wise advice and kind words.

[Update] Wedding photogs using my parents property without permission,"Original post here- [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9tew0f/wedding\_photographers\_are\_using\_ny\_familys/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9tew0f/wedding_photographers_are_using_ny_familys/)

Well, first I wanted to thank the LA group for a lot of good advice, and the BOLA group for the lulz.

My parents have now acquired an adjoining piece of land and we have several plans for it. Firstly, we are planting a large pine plantation between the wedding venue and their property. There will be no immediate effect, however, over time the trees will create a fantastic visual and sound barrier between the wedding venue and my parents' home. It will be an fantastic source of profit as the trees can eventually be cut in sections, sold, and replanted, without losing the sight and sound barrier. This will be managed by father and myself, and we plan on setting up a trust so that it can continue to be properly managed for my children/grandchildren in the future.

Unfortunately, this also means that once the trees grow a bit, it will cut off the vaunted ""sunset view"" that has been a major selling point for the wedding venue, and also make it quite hard to trespass on my parents property, as pine plantations in their first several years can be notoriously thick and hard to navigate.

Secondly, just beyond the pine plantation, we have created a private firing range. That way we can safely enjoy our (quite loud) firearms from the convenience of my parent's backyard. The volume of fire might increase during wedding events mainly because they seem to happen on the weekends, and that's when the fellas from the gun club will be coming over. We've also spoken with local law enforcement and firearms instructors about using our range free of charge for things such as firearm certification/qualifying and Concealed Carry licensing tests.

Third, since we are going to be hunting the property as we have for almost 20 years now, we will be marking everything quite aggressively with ""posting purple"" and a bevy of No Trespassing signs, and have contacted the local game and fish department about dealing with trespassers as they seem to be a bit more independent that the local law enforcement, and just happen to be friends with most of the gun club members as well.

So, all in all, patience will win the day, and there's the added bonus that, if something happens to the trees... tree law.

Merry Christmas!

**Edit: Forgot to mention-** the family lawyer has sent C&D letters to the property owners and several of the photographers that have been identified through social media posts that have trespassed on their land to take the pictures. They were mailed out right before the Christmas break so they will likely be getting those today.",legaladvice
"[FL] My neighbor has basically booby trapped his front yard, what can I legally do about it?","So I live in a house in a south Florida suburb where the streets are wide enough to allow street parking (legally) for guests as most houses only have a small driveway to fit a couple cars tops.  This has never been an issue in the 3 years I've lived here but lately my neighbor has gotten really obsessed about people driving ""up his lawn"" and scuffing his grass when they park and this week decided to do something about it.  

His grass goes all the way to the street and when people turn in to park they sometimes drive maybe a foot onto his grass if they're really careless.  I've always told my guests to park away from his house because I know how angry he gets about it and I don't want the hassle.  However said neighbor has now placed several rebar posts with the tops sharpened to tips right at the edge of his grass and they're low enough in that they're hard to spot if you're driving by or unfamiliar with the street.  I asked the neighbor about it when I was walking my dog and he said that if people are gonna be dicks and drive on his lawn they deserve to get their tires punctured.  

I have to assume that there is no way this is legal, but what exactly can I do about it?  Is this something I should call the city about or is it a police matter?

**EDIT:**  I've called the police non-emergency line from work and they said they would send out someone to take a look and talk to the neighbor if need be.  I'll update when something happens.",legaladvice

"[Florida] I found out that my younger sister was sent away to a religious camp for her sexuality by my evangelical parents, who lied and took money from me (I believe) to fund it. I am furious.","I posted this in r/relationships but I was told to post here. I live in Florida and so do my parents. This rest of this is a direct copy paste of what I posted there.

I posted a thing here a two years ago that helped me with an uncomfortable situation involving a boss at work and it helped me save a good friendship and my job, so hopefully you guys can help me again with a much much more serious situation. I didn't remember that account so I made a new one. I need to give a little background to explain the situation. This will probably be long. I'm shitty at writing so please bare with me.

I work as a computer engineer and live away from my parents. I moved out when I was 18, not because we had a particularly distant relationship, but because I was very hungry for independence and I didn't want to go to college like they wanted me to. I fell in love with programming and got a job a month after I graduated, and I've done that since. I am extremely frugal, and I now make about 70k a year after taxes (go mr. money mustache). Both my parents are in traditional white collar jobs that make significantly more money than I do, and they are horrific with money.

When I was growing up my parents were semi-religious (church on easter and christmas type of deal) and not particularly invested in it or politics. Somewhere in the last three or four years they became interested in it, and in the last year in particular (regarding the last elecion especially) they have become some of the most religious and overfocused political people i've ever seen. I have tried distancing myself from this by refusing to talk about these issues over the phone at all. I could not disagree more with them. I think they have some very hateful views, but I've chosen not to engage them on it.

Growing up I was not close to my younger sister, mainly because of our age gap. However she has grown up and is very pleasant to speak to. We have spoken on the phone daily (I speak to mom and dad much less frequently) since she was around 14. I have not been exposed to to much of this because I intentionally tell both sides I don't want to talk about their drama (although I am generally clear with my sister that I agree with her, but I don't want to badmouth her parents). My sister is a lesbian, which I have no issue with whatsoever, and my parents do not (or did not) know and would immediately be against. We talked about this a quite often. My sister also has political views completely at odd with my parents (she was in trouble for not supporting their favorite political candidate, you can probably guess who) but I encouraged her to swallow it and suck it up at home for her safety and sanity. She mentioned a few times in the last two months about wanting to come out to them and I highly highly discouraged it. I have heard both of my parents approve of a pastor who disowned his gay son and similar stories. I didn't want them to do that to her. I have offered to let her live with me when she turns 18 but imagined that being in the future. I made her promise not to do that and she did.

On her 16th birthday, she came out to them. I was a little angry with her over the phone (I didn't curse or scream or anything, but I was annoyed, but with sympathy for her position. I did chide her a bit, which I acknowledge was dumb.) She was extremely mad at me and didn't call me for four days, which was a long time for us not to speak.

We spoke afterwards and I was much better, but things weren't going well. They didn't kick her out but weren't speaking to her at all. Literally she was screaming at them and they just quietly went into their rooms, not saying a word.

I offered to speak to them for her and she begged me not to, so I did not, against my better judgement.

My Dad, a week later, called me over the phone. He said that he was sick and needed emergency money to have a procedure He begged me ""not to tell"" mom or my sister. He needed about 20 grand. I had refused them money in the past for a car loan and made it clear that I wasn't giving them money, but I did for this, cautious but ultimately trusting him not to lie about his own potential death. I disagreed with him about a lot of things but he had always been so steadfast about the importance of honesty the thought of him lying about something like that seemed ridiculous and I felt guilty for even thinking that.

About another week after that, my sister stopped calling me. I thought she was mad again for some reason but she didn't answer at all. I was worried. I called my parents and asked about her after about a week and they said she was being moody (I thought they thought I didn't know about her sexuality or what was going on).

I checked my Facebook that night and I read an days old message from one of her friends that explained that she had been trying to reach me and that my sister was taken from her house into a van and driven off by men in a program with her and my parents there before kicking the friend out of the house. Her friend visited my parents house several times and they eventually told her they sent her to a religious program. She didn't get the name.

I called up my father, and he denied it twice before admitting it after a long talk. I was so angry. They seriously have these religious camps that parents can send teens to anytime without committing a crime forever. I didn't think it had anything to do with the money, but I looked it up after that and found out that these programs are generally very expensive. I called him up again and he admitted that's where the money went. I demanded that he let her out and he told me it was his money. I told him I'd never speak to him again and he just ignored me. I try calling him up every few hours for the last several days when I found out and they ignore almost all of my calls.

He intentionally didn't tell me the name of the facility or camp, but I've done reading and these are almost always dangerous places. I don't even know if she is in the US anymore. People die and get brainwashed at these places. I feel so guilty for giving them the ability to do this. I don't know the name of the camp, and I did technically give them the money.

My only recourse at this point is to go tell everyone in their neighborhood what they did. I saw a facebook post they made about sending my sister to a snooty christian boarding school and that is NOT what they did. I called the school they posted and she isn't going there. They are very connected to the church/suburban town community and I think it would threaten them to have their image splattered with the truth.

I would completely disown them now if it wouldn't completely destroy my chances of getting her out. I am at a loss. Please help me.

tl;dr: My parents lied to me and took money claiming it was for an illness only to turn around and use it to send my sister to a camp because she came out. They are ignoring my calls. I don't have any legal grounds (i think) and I do not know how to convince them to let her out.

Bank refusing to return money stolen by convicted fraudsters,"Location: USA

At the beginning of this year, I had a break-in, in which my ID and checkbook were stolen. I immediately contacted my bank (Bank of America) to put a freeze on the account, and then opened a new account and put all of the money into it. The following day, money started disappearing from the new account. I went straight to the bank and removed all of my remaining money, but money continued disappearing while I was at the bank, the people involved making off with about $3000 by using my ID and going through the drive-through. I took the rest of my money to a different bank, and put in a claim for the stolen funds.

Bank of America didn't get back to me on my claim until 4-5 months later, at which point they returned some of the money, minus $1000. (At this point, I'd also had issues with bill pay bouncing checks off of all the institutions I had bills set up for, even though my account was both frozen and empty, and then had to deal with bounced-check fees from those merchants.) With the help of a local branch employee, we eventually figured out that the $1000 was a check that the fraudsters had bounced off of my account around the same time all of the other things were going on. (They'd written a check on the account of someone else whose ID and checks had been stolen.) I hadn't been aware of this check, because it hadn't posted to my account until several days after I'd removed all my money from it, and so I hadn't actually lost any money from this at the time. So, I put in a new claim for the remaining $1000.

Several more months pass, then Bank of America gets back to me with a form letter denying my claim because I was supposed to report the fraud within 60 days of its occurrence and hadn't done so. I have an appointment at the local branch again tomorrow to try to resolve this - though all the local branch people do is put in claims with a department elsewhere.

In the meanwhile, the fraudsters wound up getting arrested and pleading to some lesser charges with respect to ID thefts against a dozen or so people. The police weren't ever terribly communicative with me and I don't know the details of who did what or what type of evidence they have in my specific case. It almost certainly wouldn't include this check though since I didn't know to report it. I assume the fraudsters have been spending their ill-gotten gains and wouldn't actually ever pay a judgment against them, if I could even prove which one was responsible for the bounced check. 

I am feeling at the end of my rope here. So, Reddit, any advice on this situation? Am I out $1000 because I didn't report the bounced check within 60 days even though I had reported that fraud was occurring on the account and had frozen and emptied the account before the check ever posted? Shouldn't Bank of America have notified me that this activity occurred when my account was frozen and fraud had been reported? What is the best way to go about getting my money back? If I report to an agency, which would be most effective? I've already had to miss a not-insignificant amount of work time meeting with folks at the local bank branch and the better part of a year has passed since the break-in, so I'm more than ready for all of this to finally be over.",legaladvice
Detained and Deported at London Stansted due to Airline incorrect re-routing,"This is a request for advice regarding an extremely unfortunate set of circumstances that led to a situation at London Stansted on Thursday April 18 and Friday April 19 (in the early hours of yesterday morning). I am a South African national, Dutch residence card holder who requires a visa when transiting through the UK. I was detained and deported from London Stansted on the night of Thursday April 18 and sent back to my port of departure (Eindhoven, Netherlands) in the early morning hours of April 19, Good Friday.

&#x200B;

I hold a full Dutch residence permit, and was travelling to Dublin, Ireland. My original flight was a direct Eindhoven - Dublin trip, but due to overbooking on the Airline (which I won't name at this point), I was denied boarding and given a rerouting free of charge through Stansted. Upon being given this routing, I asked to check if I was allowed to travel without a UK visa through Stansted. I was told yes from the Airline customer service, and that I could follow up with both Airport and Airline officials at Eindhoven when I arrived at EIN airport.Upon arrival at the airport, I insisted that Eindhoven officials call the Airline Immigration office to check the route was compatible with my travel documents. They did, and were told by the immigration manager there (of the Airline), that I was okay to board.

&#x200B;

This information was incorrect. I boarded the flight and was assured everything was okay. Upon arrival at Stansted, I was detained for 15 hours, interviewed, all belongings searched, my biometrics were taken, my photograph was taken, and then I was deported, and given a refusal-of-entry stamp on my passport. 

&#x200B;

I have gone back to Eindhoven and collected all the information to build a case against the Airline (and their immigration department in particular) for giving incorrect travel advice to Eindhoven airport officials, and by extension assuring me that it was okay to board when in fact I had absolutely no entry clearance whatsoever. I have contacted the South African embassy in the Hague. I have not received response yet, but hope they will stand by me and support me in this fiasco. I don't know what the consequences are of having a denial-of-entry stamp but it was completely not my fault. In fact, when I got back to Eindhoven, I insisted that an official there call English Immigration directly to confirm that I should never have been given the green light to board by the Airline Immigration officials (or re-routed via Stansted in the first place by the Airline). English immigration confirmed that Airline Immigration acted in error.

&#x200B;

I have documents proving the advice that was given to Eindhoven airport officials. I also have documents proving that Eindhoven supplied all necessary and complete information to the Airline before a decision was made. I have the name of the Airline immigration manager who gave the go-ahead, I have the boarding pass that clearly states: ""OK TO BOARD"" and I have the internal documents that state ""CALLD IMMIGRATION. SOUTH AFRICAN PP WITH DUTCH RESIDENCE CARD -- OK TO STANSTED"".

&#x200B;

I did not leave that airport until I had acquired scans of every document I could. I have scans of all internal documents with respect to my trip. I even have an email sent from the Airline Immigration Manager to the Manager of the Visa Check at the Airport saying ""Yes he can travel without a visa through UK if he has Dutch residence card hence my advice yesterday."" --> which is false.

&#x200B;

At this point, I have taken the following steps:

Made an official, strongly worded complaint to the Airline (and attached a name of a customer service rep who I spoke with for easier follow up)

I have contacted my embassy

I have contacted the British Home Office who runs the border force that detained me. Not with a complaint, but simply an explanation of what happened and why I was there, similar to above)

I have also sent a strongly worded complaint to the Airport, strategically knowing that the Airport will likely shift blame to the Airline when they see the docs and add pressure.

From the Airline's side, this is approaching professional negligence and I will pursue them as much as is humanly possible. I should never have been re-routed via Stansted, and I should never have been given an explicit green light to board (after asking multiple times and making calls to Airline immigration, and having been assured of my correctness in boarding).

I also ask if I can put on my shoes (as I was wearing old moccasins with barely any sole) and she laughs at me and puts me in her car. I can't see much else happening now. When she gets in the car I ask her again if she got my stuff and she angrily tells me yes and says something to the effect of I'm annoying her, so I dont question it further. 

I'm taken to the station, then transported to the county lockup 40 miles away. When I get there, they dump out the brown paper bag of my stuff that the officer had filled, and my phone and cards aren't in there of course. I ask the transport officer what happened to phone and money (cards), and he says he has no idea.  

8hrs later when I am released, I am stuck 40 miles away from my car with my phone and money in it. It takes me nearly two full days to get back to my phone, thru some very remote areas, where it is 120+ degrees. I spent the night on a bench outside a casino. I had no water, nor money for any, knew no phone numbers off the top of my head, no cab would take me to my car without payment upfront, hours of begging for a ride all failed. I badly burned and cut my feet on the searing concrete and broken glass on the side of the road. At one point I flagged down a sheriff and he laughed and told me he wasn't a taxi and left me. I fainted twice. The first resulted in tribal police waking me and asking me to move on, and when I only made it slightly further, the person who helped me ended up giving me a ride the rest of the way. When I finally get to my car I get my phone, but my card is missing... still is, which still makes things a pain in the ass. Just for the heck of it I went and checked around where my car was parked yesterday, and I found one of my cards (a postmates card) in the street there, so they were obviously dropped by the officer and ignored. 

Additionally, this cost me a extra two days in storage as my car was impounded, and I was starting a new job Monday morning, yet still did not have my phone and obviously did not make the shift, and so no more job. All for an 1/8th of mushrooms, which I take full responsibility for, along with the expired tags, but I've had several people tell me that denying my my phone and shoes like that was illegal. I have no idea at all. I'm still too exhausted to really process everything. I can say for certain that was the worst two days of my 34 years worth, and I can't think of a worse way to follow up my first arrest/first time in jail that 48hrs in the desert with no belongings. 

Any info, even if it's ""nope they can do that"", would be appreciated. Thanks guys. ",legaladvice
[FL] Police in full tactical gear came looking for me with guns when I haven't committed a single crime ever.,"So this happened about 2 weeks ago, I get a call from family explaining that the police came looking for me in full tactical gear, with rifles and the whole 9 yards.

To make a long story short, everyone is confused about the situation as am I.

I'm attending school at one of the state university's, but don't live on campus. I also don't have any mail sent to where I live because there's an office that sorts mail, and I'm not on the lease.

So I ended up missing the police looking for me at two locations, by shear luck.

They left a business card at one location in case anyone hears anything, and the strange part is that the officer that left the card is a Detective with SWAT/Fugitive Special Operations.

Another thing that's weird, is that the police said I had stolen a rental vehicle to Virigina which makes no sense.
I'm not even old enough to rent a car, nor have I ever rented a car. I'm too broke for that.

I'm confused because a little bit of googling and youtube shows that Fugitive Operations has to do with Immigration, and the tactical gear sounds like ERO - which are for convicted violent offenders that are getting deported.

I'm not sure what kind of lawyer to even consult for something like this, and just to be clear, I was born here, have medical records and all.

All my life I've heard that my dad didn't have his papers, and at one point he stole my sensitive identification documents. To make matters worse, we have the same name, and went no contact 4 years ago because of his abusive ways. I tried to file a report for stolen identity but couldn't because he didn't use my credit at the time. Apparently he was using my identity to drive, so I was able to file a report with Florida Highway Safety Motor Vehicles, and get my first drivers license, but no police report.

I'm not sure how to approach this situation as I'm worried about the police arresting me for something I didn't do especially in the middle of my summer classes, and I just started a new job.

Could the SWAT/Fugitive Special Operations be immigration?
And what's the correct kind of lawyer to consult on this?

Thanks for any help.



**Update:** So after consulting with lawyers, I ran a warrant check, and it turns out it was a case of mistaken identity which is bull, but means I'm ok.

I checked my counties records, and lo and behold my father had been arrested for a felony as well as a moving violation.

Honestly I know it's because we share the same name. I'm assuming he didn't show back up to court after posting bond, and here we are.

Thank you to the community for all the support.

I think to those in similar situations, it's in your best interest to file an informational report at least informing the state that your identity is being abused. I wish I had done that, but I was fortunate to have this sort itself out.

I'm not a lawyer obviously so that is just a suggestion.

Again thank you to the community for all their advice, and guidance on legal representation.",legaladvice
[WI] Roommates and I complained about faulty oven to landlord and he refused to replace it; two days ago it malfunctioned and a wall of fire hit me in the face and I now have second degree burns on most of my face and feel traumatized,"Hi everyone. My two roommates and I live on the upper floor of a duplex that is quite old - most of the things in it are old, including the oven. 

The oven has always given us some trouble: it is an old natural gas type that you need to manually light every time you would like to cook something, but on some occasions it would not light at all because no gas would come out. We emailed the landlord about this issue and he refused to replace it and said we were using it wrong and offered some alternatives that didn't necessarily work. We also have a string of other things we wanted help with that he refused (the previous tenants left a 250lb+ grill on the porch that we haven't been able to move and he hasn't sent anyone for, we asked him to look at the broken dishwasher but he didn't, the lock on the back door is very loose and would be extremely easy to kick in).

Two nights ago my roommates and I were in the kitchen cooking. I put some garlic bread in the oven, then went to grab a lighter. The pilot light that needs to be lit is at the bottom of the oven's compartment, so I turned on the gas and then lit the light as per usual and a wall of fire engulfed my face. I reeled back and I could immediately feel intense pain in my face. My roommates alerted me that my hair was on fire and quickly patted it out; I ran to the bathroom to run cold water on my face and I looked in the mirror directly after and most of my facial hair/eyebrows were gone, and my eyelashes were 80% gone. My eyes and nose were excreting fluids and my face was visibly swollen. 

I went to a walk in care but they told me I NEEDED to go to the emergency room immediately, where they applied some medicine and kept me for a few hours to watch me. Apparently with facial burns it is possible that swelling can occur and air passages can close, but luckily I was deemed okay to leave.

I'm back home now and about 50% of my face has been diagnosed with second degree burns - both my cheeks, around my eyes, and most of my nose. My lips are entirely scorched and blistered and I can only drink through a straw because the pain/fluid excretion is too much, and my face is begin the process of peeling. I emailed my landlord and he called me directly after and expressed his apologies and said he was going to purchase a new oven immediately (he later sent me the receipt for a new oven - the same exact model as the one that burned me). He said he would understand if I wanted to file an insurance claim and said he would get back to me with some info.

So here's the thing: he got back to me today and said his insurance agent said he likely wouldn't be liable. I'm wondering if that's true. I'm going to consult a lawyer regardless, but these burns have been very traumatizing. I already had generalized anxiety and this has exacerbated it beyond belief - I haven't left the house to get groceries because my face is full of blisters, and I've had to cancel some of my work (I freelance) because I've been straight up unable to get out of bed due to depression and worry that my burns are going to scar. I actually liked my face before - I wasn't a looker or anything but it was one of the very few parts about myself I liked, and now I may have scars on it for the rest of my life. This whole situation has really killed my spirit, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

[UPDATE] $400 pet fee for a cat I don't own,"First things first, thank you everyone for all the help! I've settled things with management, and no longer have to pay the fees. The reason behind that is something I just had to share with you guys.

I managed to catch the cat after leaving a few bowls of food, and it turns out he does have a collar. It's just hard to see under all his fur. So I looked at the tags, hoping to find an address. There was one engraved into one of the tags, but there was just one small problem: The address was mine.

Luckily, there was also a phone number, and this one wasn't mine. So I dialed the number, and it turns out this cat (Butter) belongs to the people who used to live in my apartment. They moved to a condo across the street, and forgot to get new tags for Butter.

I explained my situation, and asked if they could tell management what was going on. They did, and less than an hour later, I got a call from the leasing office. They apologized for the ""misunderstanding"" and said I no longer had to pay the fees. Naturally, I made sure to get that shit in writing. I don't think Butter will stop visiting my balcony, but as long as I'm not getting in any trouble because of it, he's more than welcome to drop by whenever he feels like it.",legaladvice
Update- My coworker adopted a kid from the Ukraine a couple of years ago. Now she's going around work asking us to adopt him and writing about giving him away on Facebook.,"Let me start with saying a huge thank you to everyone in this subreddit that replied to my post. Now that the dust has settled a bit, I'm honestly kinda overwhelmed by the number of people that went to huge lengths to tell me about just how serious this situation was/is, deep dived on resources, ect. I got PM's from people that worked for local and state governments and private agencies that were outside of my state but offered their contacts. I had people that spoke Russian/Ukrainian offering to help contact the Ukrainan Embassy and offered me contact information for Embassy departments. People even contacted us offering money for Tony's immediate needs in the event we decided to take him in. I'm sincerely touched by the genuine concern all of you had for Tony and his siblings and I hope one day I can tell Tony that despite everything that's happened, there's people out there like you guys that care about him. The information you guys gave us helped us act fast and got the ball rolling on this situation faster than me and my boyfriend would've figured out alone.

I talked with the cops about the situation and honestly? They were just as confused as I was. The person I talked to on the phone was just as stumped but he agreed that at a minimum they did need to do a welfare check. I've had experiences with welfare checks before and I had the nagging feeling that something just wouldn't go right…and someone PM'd me the priority line for my state's child protective services hotline. I got someone on the phone right away, and as soon as I mentioned that trafficking could be going on and that she was advertising the kid on Facebook (it was a public post here too, people), they acted with a quickness. I gave them all the information I had on Mary and Tony and all the information I had from Mary about Tony's adoption. The person I spoke to right away said that she suspected that the adoption MIGHT NOT EVEN BE LEGAL. I was floored. I e-mailed all the screenshots I had to the person I spoke with and asked for a followup if that was at all possible. I said that myself and my boyfriend were willing to take Tony on a temporary basis if necessary, but the CPS representative said that likely wasn't possible. Then, the waiting game began. Last night was probably the most stressful night I've ever had- hell at one point, I was ready to drive out to Mary's house myself but was stopped by my boyfriend. It was tough.

The cops followed up with us at approximately 2:00AM. Note that I haven't heard from CPS. The officer I spoke with was very cautious and limited in what he said, but he told me that CPS arrived at the home shortly after he did. In not so many words, he implied that Mary had been talking to someone about meeting Tony the very next day and that CPS' suspicions were confirmed— Tony's adoption was not legal. Tony was rehomed to Mary and her husband from another state where placement needs to be approved by a judge. He didn't elaborate further except to say that other issues came to light and all of the children were removed from the home for their own safety by CPS. He didn't say how long they were there, but said it was ""a long time"". I was asked to drop off all e-mails and printouts to the station in the morning, and I agreed.

My boyfriend and I wanted to make doubly sure that all of our bases were checked, so I called our local FBI office who said they lacked jurisdiction in the matter but would be writing up a complaint and referring the issue to the State Department. We called the Ukrainian Embassy and made a detailed complaint and I included the contact information I had for the officer from the department.

The shit really hit the fan when I went into work to printout the e-mail. Our company is pretty small and the company owner, (I'll call her Big Ange because of her resemblance to the Mob Wives lady) had gotten wind of Mary's email. Big Ange was FURIOUS, and waiting at Mary's desk to see if she would show up for work. My friend reported that Big Ange waited from 7:15 - 9:30 AM, and that Mary CAME TO WORK WITH A SOB STORY ABOUT HOW HER KIDS WERE BEING UNFAIRLY TAKEN AWAY! Mary wanted time off from work to ""clear her name"" and ""devote herself to re-claiming her family from this misunderstanding"". I wasn't there to witness this, but Big Ange, who has six kids herself, apparently ripped Mary a new asshole. Mary has been dismissed and rumor has it that Big Ange may or may not allow her to claim unemployment.

My head is honestly still spinning from everything that has happened. The past 24 hours have been insanity. I'm so grateful that the system worked as quickly as it did. I only hope it works out a long term solution to this problem and that Mary doesn't get to reclaim her kids. My heart is breaking for Tony and the other kids right now…I don't know what the fuck was happening in Mary's house that made CPS remove them that night, but I'm going to sleep better knowing that they aren't with psycho ass Mary and her husband, at least for awhile. What the future holds for Tony and the other kids (especially because Tony's adoption was apparently illegal) makes me sick…but I'm going to wish for the best.

I need a damn drink.

tl;dr: CPS took the kids. They're safe. Mary has been fired from work. Redditors amaze me with their kindness and willingness to help in times of crisis.",legaladvice

I really really wanted to make things right with my brother but it seemed like it wasn't a good idea. I talked to a lawyer who went through everything and told me that if I confess my brother may get reduced sentence but maybe not as he will still be charged with possession and destruction of evidence and he will not be released from prison. So nothing will happen more than the chance of a small reduction. I will also get charged and will likely go to prison for a few years.

I talked to my brother and he doesn't want me to do anything. He says punishing myself will not help him and he'd rather I stay out of trouble so that him going to prison would count for something. He says if I also go to prison then what he's been through will be for nothing.

I've made a promise to myself. I'm gonna stay out of trouble, study well, work hard and make a lot of money and give half of everything I earn to my brother for the rest of my life. It's a big promise but I will keep it. He's there paying for my sins and it's not right. I hope I can stay strong and do whatever I can for him as he's been strong for me.

[GA] Wife being bullied and discriminated at work for being intersex.,"Around Thanksgiving my wife has been hanging out with some of her co-workers and they were talking about having children in the future.

[UPDATE][TX]Pecan tree severely cut back by trimmers who came to wrong yard,"Seeing the sweet justice that guy in Oregon got reminded me that I never updated on my MIL's situation! I apologize in advance if I get any details wrong, as this is hearsay from my partner and I haven't talked directly to my MIL about it.

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/76strr/tx_pecan_tree_severely_cut_back_by_trimmers_who/

So my MIL had an arborist out who judged that, with some work and care, the tree should be able to survive the damage. By his appraisal, there was around $5500 in damage to the tree. Sadly, the photos my MIL was able to dig up weren't enough to let the arborist give a good estimate on how much the tree's nut production would be impacted, so she just went forward with that number.

She had a lawyer friend draft up a registered letter to the tree trimmers explaining the arborist's appraisal and her intentions to pursue repayment through whatever legal means were necessary. The trimmers came back with an offer to pay that amount but in 3 installments over the next year. She countered half immediately and half in a month. Two weeks later she gets contacted by the trimmer's insurance company and they sent her a single check for the full amount.

I've received a bogus invoice from my Uncle's business because I refused to take his son on a road trip at the last minute to meet a cruise ship.,"**The backstory part**

My aunt and uncle have always been pushy people and their son (my cousin, but family stresses don't have me relating to him in any way) is a 19 year old painful entitled arse I never had much to do with personally.

I'd been planning a road trip from Sydney to Townsville for a while, and I posted details on facebook of when I was leaving in September this year. Aunt and Uncle caught wind of this and asked if I'd take their son with me, and drop him off in Brisbane in time to catch a cruise. I said no at first, but after a few pushy phonecalls from them I said I'd do it but I laid out conditions that he had to keep the attitude down. They know as well as anyone what he's like, and they promised he'd behave, so I agreed to take him. My mistake agreeing to that.

On the morning I had to leave I packed and went to pick up their son from their house. He was still asleep and hadn't even begun to pack. After 2 hours of waiting and putting my schedule behind, we got going on the road. We didn't get 20km before he'd insulted me about my weight, spat chewing gum out the window, and jammed his feet with shoes up on the dash. The whole reason for my road trip was to stretch the legs of my car, and it's a cheap but fun sort-of-classic I'm attached to. He'd already scored the dashtop with his feet when I pulled over, laid into him about feet on the dash, and I snapped when he came back with ""babe, if you want this to be painless for the both of us you need to get the stick out of your arse"". 

So I turned around, and suffered 20 minutes of abuse before getting him back home, all the time with him threatening me with how pissed his dad was going to be.

After some trouble getting him out of the car when he was back home, I left him and his baggage in their driveway and went off on my trip.

**The legal part**

I've now been back a fortnight, and yesterday morning I received an invoice from my uncle's business for a total of $9200 for 'Travel', and a final notice warning that it would be sent to collections if it wasn't immediately paid. I phoned my uncle and he broke it down that they'd tried to get their son on a flight to Brisbane but he never got on it and bummed about with friends locally without them knowing, and wasted opportunities they'd organised for him on the cruise.

I'm beyond annoyed and told him to jam it, posted a scan of the invoice on Facebook with the background story, and I've received nasty emails from both my aunt and uncle (I refuse to take their calls) threatening me to take it down, and also to pay it or he *will* send it to collections.

Obviously it's not a legally valid invoice, even though as far as I can tell it's a regular normal looking invoice his business would send out, but what can I do here that'll quickly get him off my back? It wouldn't surprise me if he did try to send it to collections if I don't do anything. 

For all the stupidity of that act, which I'm sure can get him in deep trouble if I pushed back legally, he's knowledgeable of the law and I think he's expecting to take advantage of my lack of legal knowledge to make me pay. Is there a law I can quickly quote back at him in reference to the invalid invoice and fraud, without me going straight to a lawyer of my own, or would should I get a lawyer to fire back so he backs down? The cost of that would hit me hard at the moment but if I have to I have to.",legaladvice

The seller was an elderly woman and I was asking about what would happen should something happen to her, since she was obviously the party that I was making payments to. I was pretty afraid of paying thousands of dollars on an animal and then having a potential heir situation dispute my ownership interest.     
I had full interest transferred to me after the first payment so it was like buying a property that was owner-financed, I guess—I just made payments directly to the seller. I recently saw on Facebook that the seller was having health challenges, so I rushed and paid off my balance with her a few months early. I have some experience in the field of elder law and I have noticed that when one thing happens to an old body, there tends to be a tragic domino effect. I didn't want to get caught in a situation where there was any potential for conflict; I just wanted a pony...I have now cleared my debt to her and the horse's papers are en route to me via his breed registry, to be transferred into my name. The seller's health has since improved in while she is still pursuing some treatments, she is still absolutely as sharp as a whip and we enjoyed a nice telephone call this week.       
As for the horse: he is one hundred percent of my sanity and my life is much improved with him in it. He is gorgeous and exactly what the seller promised me that he was. He is now twelve years old, which is the prime of a horse's life, and it shows. He is castrated, but I am in the process of contacting the owner of the sire to see if it would be possible to freeze some semen if said sire still fertile. I would like to help continue this unique bloodline, if that's possible, since both the seller of my horse and the current owner of the stud are ladies have an advanced age.     
My horse and I are planning to make a debut at a higher level in a FEI-affiliated event in January. Everything has worked out better than could've been hoped for. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I'm excited to report that it may not be a train.

Neighbor lured over my child and administered a drug test,"I got home to find my child missing. My child is a friend with the nearby neighbor child. The neighbor child's parent suspected the kids were doing drugs and administered a urine sample drug test, which came back negative.

I mad to say the least. Beyond being an incredible invasion of privacy, did the neighbor also commit a criminal act?

"$20,000,000 verdict against HOA, owners now liable for $88,000 each","Teenager was injured by playground equipment, HOA was sued and lost because they knew the equipment was defective, didn't follow the manufacturer's maintenance plan, and didn't do their own maintenance. The HOA is currently appealing the verdict. Insurance only covers $2,000,000, leaving $18,000,000. There are 205 homes total. This is in Las Vegas, NV.  

My girlfriend owns a home in this community, and we're trying to assess her options. Is it a foregone conclusion that the HOA will have to come up with this money and hit the homeowners with an assessment? With the HOA found liable, can the HOA hold the property management company responsible? Is there anything she and the other homeowners can do about this mess?

"My GM is strongly implying ill be Terminated or forced to pay back some money that went missing. After we have an ""Investigation"" (ARKANSAS)","Some history:
 I was hired here by 2 of the District Coaches. I was trained at one of their higher performing stores for 6 weeks as an Assistant Restaurant Manager. The District Manager/Coach tried to brief me on how the store/location I was being assigned is underperforming and would like me to apply what I learned through all training. He told me there were people they wanted to get rid of and that they really needed help. They needed someone consistent even though it could get frustrating. And trust me it is! When I meet my GM he pretty much was saying the same thing. He wanted to get rid of problem people. 
So I go in applying my training on rules, proper portioning and service quality long story short Ive been meet with sooo much opposition. Apparently this location has been ""cheating"" they have been doing things their way for so long that im a complete disruption to their whole system.  Ive been keeping the District Manager/Coach informed of all the things they do that they are not supposed too and he in turn wants wants me to keep ""Nipping at the Bit"" or whatever he calls it. Trust me when I say they (the location) hates me! 

The upcoming Investigation:
At some point after I count my safe on the 9th and when the morning manager counted their safe on the 10th $100 went missing. 
We use the ""Crew"" app, an app for Employers to chat with employees. My fellow managers and my GM are strongly implying i took this money and my GM is also implying ""Someone"" will be terminated they wont come and say its me but the language and the obviously specifc details imply its me. 
The thing is im actually very computer Savvy.  I was able to run a report on the safe that documented everytime it was opened and by whom. I found through my own ivestigation that 2 Managers had gone into the safe between counts. 

I dont think  anyone knows how to run these reports or I probably wont have been harrassed about all this the way I am, I honestly believe they just want to try to get rid of me. 
When I present this report tomorrow during their investigation Im afraid that when the GM sees its one of his buddies that was actually in the safe last, he will not be willing to punish the individual so harshly.

Is there any thing I can do legally If my GM doest punish the individual to the full extent he was soo willing to punish me?
What If Im still somehow wrongfully terminated behind this?",legaladvice

(MD/SE Asia) I just found out my wife faked her death ~5 years ago. WTF do I do now?!?!,"I am reeling right now, its been a couple of days but I am still completely shell shocked by all of this and I have no idea where to go from here. 

I was married to a woman from South Asia for 10+ years. We met overseas and got married here in the US. She became a US citizen, went to college here and had a great job. We have two wonderful children together and a lived a great life in the DC suburbs. She went back home to visit family and while she was there we got the news that she had been killed in a car accident; that was in 2013. Our children were 5 and 6 at the time.

It was obviously extremely traumatic for all of us. It was complicated by the fact that no one in her family speaks English and we were constantly going through friends for translating. Her family is from a village that is not very accessible and definitely  doesn't get much western tourism. She was cremated and I have her remains in an urn here at the house. 

I've tried to keep up with video chats between the kids and their grandparents but it was never very successful because of the language barrier.

Well, a couple of days ago I get a video chat request from her sister and when I answer it my wife is there. I was an absolute mess. She told me that she was just so overwhelmed and couldn't deal with being a mother or living in a foreign country any more. Her whole family helped her cover this up and staged the whole thing for her. She has been living there the whole time.

I'm not here for relationship advice. I've called out of work but I haven't told anyone yet. I've got a session with a shrink next week, but WTF do I do next?

We had a $500k life insurance policy on her that I used to pay off the house and all of our credit card debt. I've still got like $100k of it left in college accounts for the kids. Am I going to have to pay this money back? I don't have that kind of money. I am beyond furious. There is no way I want her back in our lives. I know I will have to tell the kids but I don't want her near them. How do I protect myself and my children? Are we still even married? Would she be able to get custody/visitation with them?

Update. Stabbed at work and fired for my troubles.,"So before I give the Update, I wanted to say a few things. 

First I am not some Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Taekwondo, Krav Maga, or Patrick Swayze Roadhouse style bar bouncer. I am not a veteran who obtained my sick martial arts skills in the streets of Mosul. What happened was simply addrenaline and a decent amount of martial arts training I received when I was a kid kicking in. Although I do occasionally work out at the gym at my work so I am stronger than your average network admin. Also for those calling bullshit in the PMs saying that a punch to the jaw will not knock you out, well I have a small lesson. A well placed punch to the jaw can cause minor to major brain trauma as the act of your brain shaking about in your head can overload the nervous system making you lose consciousness. Your muscles instantly relax and you fall to the ground with no memory of the last few seconds. 

In other words go watch some UFC... 

Second. To the people in the thread and in my PMs, I did not punch him in retaliation for stabbing me. His knife was still inside me and his hand was on the knife when I punched him in pure fear. More like 100 percent pure terror. 

So on to the update. The company I worked for is a wholly owned subsidiary. This will be important later. The CEO of my company was unwilling to hear my side of it no matter how many times I tried to approach him.  The best response I got was when his secretary gave me the line of ""trusting the decisions of HR."" Several emails and 2 phone calls got the same response from him and his assistant each and every time. Because of the fact that no one at the office is willing to even hear my side, I decided to go to a lawyer that was recommended through a friend. Friend contacted a lawyer he used in the past who referred me to someone he trusts. Upon hearing my story the lawyer was very eager to take my case on contingency.  As an added bonus, he decided to represent the other three guys who helped out that day as well. 

The lawyer decided to name the parent company in the suit along side our former employer. His reasoning is that the parent company would have reviewed all corporate policies that the subsidiary has and that they would have had final say on the policies and procedure. This would have inevitably included the zero tolerance workplace violence clause that caused us to be terminated. 

Well the parent company, a company with many public contracts for city and state police in the area I might add, was not too happy to hear about what had happened. The event was apparently downplayed when it was reported to the parent company. They told the parent company something along the lines of ""A scuffle broke out in the office. As a result one of the employees was seriously injured. All employees involed will be terminated and Law enforcement are handling the criminal aspect."" Paraphrasing but that was the jist of it. 

Upon hearing about the truth of the matter, they were VERY quick to set up a meeting with us. This is a company that is in the self defense and security business. Not to be confused with people in the firearm business. They do not sell firearms, but do provide armor, non lethal options, and have security subsidiaries for police, security firms, and private citizens.  

Given the nature of their business, they know full well the damage that negative press could do if word got out that one of their subsidiaries fired a guy who fought for his life. This was the PR nightmare that gave us the edge in the negotiations.  The subsidiary I worked for is not in the self defense business. They are a security monitoring firm that only handles corporate contracts so they were not worried about that kind of press like the parent company was. Upon hearing the full details of what went down that day, the parent company went into panic mode. 

The three guys who held down my attacker wont be getting their old jobs back, but they were offered jobs doing the same thing at parent company's facility 12 miles away. They will also be compensated for lost wages at time and a half their normal pay rate for the time they were out of work. Parent company pretty much directed our old company to comply with this offer and our old company cut them a check. Since parent company has better benefits and better pay, this was a slam dunk victory for those three. Cherry on top for them is this means a closer drive for all of them. This offer was contingent on the three guys not going after either company for monetary compensation outside of what was offered, and the signing of a non disclosure agreement. With the NDA and a signed contract guaranteeing employment for at least a year, barring obvious reason to fire people, it would have been stupid of them not to take it.  

For me it was a little more complicated. They are very willing to offer me the same thing, but there are complications from infections that occurred from the stabbing as I developed MRSA in the wound. Fortunately it remains localized in my wound and has not spread to my blood stream, however if it progresses any worse than it currently is, my doctor thinks it may be prudent to cut out the infection. It is being watched very carefully and I spend probably 2 days out of the week in the hospital having the wound drained. In the meantime I have been offered the job, plus the ability to be paid while I work from home. This would allow me to get on their excellent coverage plan. (they only have a 1k deductible for single person) 

My lawyer basically told me that this was the best possible deal I could get without going to trial. He explained that the parent company can take the hit on the publicity and survive, but that since all they have to do is offer me a job and get the old company to pay me for the time I was out of work, why not? Minor expense to them and they do not have to worry about bad publicity. I took the deal they offered and signed a non disclosure agreement. 

So TL:DR of that one is that the each of us were offered compensation for lost wages and offered better paying jobs at the parent company. Far as I know our former job is paying the lawyer fees. We did not pay a dime for his services. 

As for the guy who stabbed me? I was very pissed off to learn he was offered a plea deal. His charges were reduced from attempted murder to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Since he was a model citizen before his knife wielding episode, and since this was a crime of passion, he was offered a mere 1 year in prison and a year of probation plus a 10k fine. I am told that there is the possibility that he can have his record expunged and that he can be out in as little as six months. I know that he has not appeared before the judge yet to take this plea deal. They were waiting to see if I would die as the charge would obviously change from agg assault to murder 2. Once they found out that I was stable and that the MRSA was not life threatening, they set a court date for the 12th. I will be there. 

Because of the fact that a lawsuit against him right now would be a lawsuit against his wife and child, I decided not to do anything on that front. Going after him would be a cash grab and would only hurt two people who had nothing to do with what happened that day. So I see no reason to sue him. 

Also before it is asked, yes I am taking extreme measures to deal with my MRSA. I have paid a company to come in and clean my house 4 times so far, I am taking my medications on time every time, and I am following doctor instructions for cleaning and replacing bandages. It is getting better, but my doctor thinks I will be dealing with this all the way until after valentine's day. ",legaladvice
[Ontario] Update to Feeder Employee.,"**Edit: I've received a few messages and read a few BOLA comments saying I should out Sarah, even by doing it secretly. That is absolutely out of the question. Please stop messaging and commenting to that effect.**

Hey everyone, I *really* didn't expect to have an update so soon, but my husband found something new last night and I just spent 2 1/2 hours on a skype call with my lawyer (while he's on vacation, bless his heart) so here we are. I'd also like to thank everyone who left comments in my last thread and helped me come around to waiting for my lawyer (even if it didn't go that way in the end). The majority of you were really kind and informative.

Also my last post was at risk for doxxing according to mods, so I'm going to be much more vague with this one on locations / website data. Mods, if you want something else changed please let me know.

So, onto this weekend's events. Lots of people were saying my best bet at this point would be gathering together the evidence of sick days lining up with photoshoots, so I brought all my work files home and started to go at it. Eventually I got too emotionally tired and started crying, and so my husband took over to do some of the match up work for me (he was already aware of what was going on, as he was present when I found Sarah and her husband's pictures online). While I had taken a bunch of screen shots I really had avoided looking at the actual pictures out of a mix of awkwardness / anger, and fixated on the dates listed more. However, at one point my husband called me over and asked me to look at a particular set.

Because of our field, my office has a large store room where we keep items used for set up. One of her picture sets had been taken in this store room over the weekend and had a title somewhere along the lines of ""Naughty Work"" (but not that). To give a bit of an idea of how this was even possible, my building doesn't have key locks we have a code pad system. My employees all have the codes, and it's not uncommon for any of my employees to visit the office on a weekend to do extra work or even just grab something they forgot to take home. All of that data is saved however, so I then pulled the keypad records from our server and sure enough, her code was used the day before the album was posted.

At this point I'm ashamed to say I lost it pretty hard and started screaming at the screen. It took a few hours for me to calm down, and then I called my lawyer on his personal cellphone which he said is allowable in an emergency. He picked up, I gave him a short run down and he told me to give him a half hour to finish lunch and then he'd call me right away.

I laid everything out for him (he tactfully avoided asking me how I found this profile aside from ""did someone send this to you, did you have reason to look for it, or did you find it accidentally?"" which was nice of him) and then asked him what we could do. My lawyer has said we have absolute cause to fire her without worrying about a rebuttal of this being because of her ""condition"" / weight gain, and that the best thing will be to have security at the door Monday waiting for her with everything at her desk boxed up and a formal letter of her termination.

He then suggested something I hadn't even thought about, which was needing that store room professionally cleaned (they used a plastic sheet but still...) and how to recover the cost of that from Sarah, as well as sending off a take down request for the album as my company logo is visible in at least two portions of it. He did tell me any of the accommodations I gave her without asking for a letter of disability were on me and not pursuable. At this point I'll probably just get the cost of cleaning that store room professionally, and getting rid of Sarah, which is fine with me.

My lawyer said he will be reaching out to a friend or two for help, as he's never faced anything quite like this. I told him that I could believe that, and that I was sorry to have to bring this to him. He joked that it was going to be one hell of a case study someday, and that if I need him for *anything* else related to this before he's back to give him a call.

As for me, I'm going to take 3 days off work after letting Sarah go to process my hurt feelings like some of you suggested. Then I'm going to have to install a full camera system in my office space, start building a new set of HR policies and look for someone to fill Sarah's position.

Again, thank you all for the advice you gave me even though I didn't end up needing it.",legaladvice
[UPDATE] (NC) Sold a board game on eBay for $2025 and being scammed by the buyer (NY),"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7tp5af/nc_sold_a_board_game_on_ebay_for_2025_and_being/?st=JDD8444I&sh=369ed9c1

Posted on eBay reddit and PayPal reddit. Decided to continue pursuing a PayPal appeal before getting a lawyer since that would be more costly.

I filed a local police report, USPIS report, FBI report and submitted all of that plus pictures, eBay information, tracking numbers, everything I had. PayPal went silent for a week once I started the appeal. 

Then after a week I got an email saying my fax didn't have enough information. I never sent a fax though. Tried calling them...could never get through? Decided to reach out to them on twitter asking about the fax. They never responded to that but apologized for the delay and said they were escalating to a specialist now. 

This morning I woke up to an email saying PayPal is issuing me a refund. This is their final decision and cannot be appealed by the buyer.

I will still be pushing law enforcement to engage in his fraud/attempted fraud. Hopefully this can still help the other guy that got scammed by him too. 

Now I wait for what this buyer will do next... but for now I won a PayPal case despite their infamous record and I feel okay. 

Thank you everyone for advice and good wishes! ",legaladvice
Should I turn in a student I know for violating HIPAA?,"This one is a little morally complicated. There's a girl I know that just started an internship at her local hospital near her college. We went to school together from middle school to high school, the entire time I knew her she was a bully. With that being said, I don't want to turn her in just because of that reason. Today she posted a Snapchat on her story. It was picture of one of the patient's charts. She did a really shitty job of marking out patient info but you can still clearly see some of the information. I know that violates HIPAA and honestly it makes me super uncomfortable to know that someone who would do that wants to become a doctor. Especially since she did it because she was making fun of the patient. I'm at a moral crossroads because I want to turn her in because she's a shitty person, not just for patient safety. Should I turn her in and if I did, what would be the consequences of what would happen to her? 

EDIT: This is in North Carolina, United States 

EDIT II: First of all, thank you so much to everyone for the advice. Mostly all of it has been sound, I have decided that I'm going to move forward with submitting this to the right people. She put it on her story and it is still up, I have taken a screenshot without her knowing. There's a way you can screenshot snapchats without alerting the person that you have done so. I'm going to have to do a little digging to find out what hospital she's at, I do know the college she attends though and I will be contacting the college as well. Any more advice is still welcome, again thank you so much for all of the help! 

EDIT III: Sorry for all the edits guys but I just wanted to give a quick update and also some more insight. First of all, the girl and I have no kind of relationship. We are not friends. Second of all, my moral dilemma is that reporting her will definitely impact her career in some kind of way. I know it is her fault but it will become my burden as well knowing I may have just ruined someone's life. Third, the Snapchat that she put up gave the patient's age, what procedure was done, and questions that the patient asked about post surgery. Also to give a little hindsight about what kind of person she is, the patient has cancer. She tried to mark out the surgeon's name but it was such a bad job that I was able to find the surgeon and where she works at searching only once. At this point the advice I am asking for now is what department should I ask for whenever I call the hospital and the college since I now have the hospital she is interning at. Thanks again for all of the help!",legaladvice
Got home from long trip to new tenants in apartment - MA,"I'm sorry if this is short, they have my computer so I'm using my phone. 

I went on a month and a half trip, starting mid June. I told my landlord about this in writing (email) and gave them permission to enter the apartment to do minor repairs. My lease is until mid September and I absolutely made no mention of moving out. I'm paid out through mid next month and supposedly the last month is already covered as I paid it up front with my deposit. 

I arrived at my apartment (a studio in a small building) a bit over three hours ago to find the chain on the door preventing me from opening it even though my key worked. Almost immediately I heard screaming from the people inside since they thought I was breaking in. I said that it's my apartment which they denied... even though I could see my pc and they were drinking out of my cups. They claimed that they rented the apartment as fully furnished and that I needed to fuck off since it and its contents are theirs fair and square. I pointed out the computer only to find that they had basically trashed it since they couldn't unlock it. It's a custom built machine and definitely is (or was) my most valuable possession, I don't understand why they could possibly think it would be included as a furnishing. I also had tons of clothes in the closet and drawer (assumed trashed now) and the sheets on the bed are mine. I know this, it's a factory defect set I got on sale so the chances of them having their own is next to none. 

I called the police who showed up surprisingly quickly, but the other people have a lease and recent mail for the address. I have no idea what they've been doing with my mail since the locked box was emptied.

Since we both have leases the police couldn't do anything tonight. I'm in a hotel. I'm not sure what the hell I can do. I'm concerned that now this is happening they'll sell off my stuff or otherwise be spiteful. Lots of the kitchenware are family heirlooms and can't be replaced, they have what's left of my pc, and all my furniture. I'm assuming the clothes and me-specific stuff is long gone already. I tried to grab some photos to show that they have my stuff but they shut the door when they saw so I only managed a couple blurry pics. 

I can't get a hold of my landlord and my new place isn't available for another month and a half. Since these people have been there for a month I'm scared that they have to be formally evicted and I'll have nowhere to live for the next few weeks. All my stuff is basically gone, especially if they try to get rid of the unique things. All I have is the small amount of clothing I had for my trip. 

**Edit 1:** Oh wow, thank you all for the advice! I was in full blown panic last night so I'm sorry I couldn't respond quickly. I'll try to answer questions here so everyone doesn't have to search! I apologize if anything is disjointed, I'm trying to cover as much as possible.

I still can't contact my landlord but I left messages both last night and this morning. A case has been opened with my insurance but they said not much can be done immediately because it's Sunday. I'm waiting on hearing from them before reaching out to a lawyer myself. I'm about to try the organizations suggested, hopefully they can help even more with specific information since I can't post everything here without being identified!

I do have a copy of the lease, it was all done online. I don't have the printed version though, it was in the apartment. When I moved in I paid 4x one month's rent: first month, last month, security deposit, and broker fee. I've always paid within a couple hours of rent being posted (it's an online system for all this landlord's property units) and have never missed any utilities, I know for sure this isn't from lack of payment. I had my passport with me since I was traveling outside the country so that's good! 

The landlord responded to my email, they definitely received it and acknowledged the trip. I did get home early though, as someone mentioned. By about two weeks, it was originally a two month trip. Maybe they were renting the apartment as a really short term sublet and hoping I wouldn't find out? I'm a little hopeful that they might have put my clothing in storage if so...

I'm in a neighborhood of Boston, one of the more popular ones for students. People do sublet pretty often, after reading some of these comments maybe it isn't as weird to have so much of my stuff after all. 

One thing did come up while checking out apartment details was that my electricity was off. I have autopay so I didn't even see the bill amount from last week, but if I had paid manually I (hopefully) would have noticed that my apartment was somehow using more power than usual. The only thing that should have been running was the fridge, everything else was entirely unplugged! The wifi is also still in my name and the password was on a sticky note. I imagine the new residents were told that the landlord was covering all utilities so that may also not be their fault. Same goes for the mail, they could have just thought it was a wrong address. 

I guess what I'm thinking is maybe the new residents are just as much the victims here. Their aggressive reaction could easily just be the stress of having a stranger try to get in the apartment and then call the cops. That'd make me defensive! 

I do have a possibly stupid follow up question. I'm spending the day making a list of the items I had in the apartment. Unfortunately my receipt box was in the unit so that doesn't help, thankfully most of my computer's parts were ordered online so I have that. The main question is, when deciding value does custom tailoring come into play at all? This morning I remembered that my bridesmaid dress for an upcoming wedding was in the closet. The dress itself is only a few hundred dollars (expensive but not crazy for weddings!) but it had a ton of custom work for sizing and neck line modifications. It'll be a pain to replace if I even can in time. Would it be worthwhile to try and contact the current residents to see if they kept any clothing? Or would that hurt my case? 

Also, is it better to stay in a hotel while this is getting sorted out? I'm staying with a friend right now (didn't want to bother her so late last night) but again, I'm not sure if hotels are better because of the paper trail. 

Not much has happened, tomorrow should have more progress!",legaladvice
"[ON] I caught my neighbors son stealing my underwear/other things. Family refuses to believe me or my landlord, and is threatening to sue me for slander. What can i do?","I am in Ontario, Canada. 

Moved in to the apartment at the start of January, since then i have been convinced that someone is stealing my underwear/bra/etc. Every floor has a pair of washer/dryer units, and since moving in i have had almost a dozen different things just disappear from the wash or dryer. The room is so tiny that there is no where to sit, aside from sitting on top of one of the machines, so it makes it very hard to wait for it. 

Two weeks ago i went and bought a bunch of new things, and when i went to go remove stuff from the washer i noticed that several things i had just bought went missing. Armed with this and the fact it was early Saturday morning, i went to our landlord and she was able to tell me during the 35 minutes of washing the only person who entered was my next door neighbors son. 

Now at this point i was furious and confronted the parents. The parents called me a liar, and basically told me off. They absolutely refused to believe me, however since confronting them i have had nothing go missing since then. 

Today i put laundry on and started cleaning my unit, when i went to go drop trash off, i checked the laundry and discovered our neighbors son going the dryer i was using. I again confronted the parents, and they immediately started screaming at me for harassing their son, and threatened to call the police on me for harassing their son, and threatened to sue me for ""slandering"" their son by implying he is a pervert.

"CA | Sister's mom wants to sue me for child support, claiming I play the role of her father.","My sister is 10 and I'm 30. My dad has been absent from her life for years, we don't know where he is. He wasn't around for me either, used to disappear for a few years at a time and come back for a few months only to disappear again.

I'm close with my sister, she usually spends one or two nights a week with me and my wife. I don't give her mom money, but I help out by buying her things that she need.

On Monday her mom called me telling me that we need to come to some sort of financial arrangement for child support since I have so far established myself as playing the role of the father in her life and therefore I need to pay child support. I laughed that off as it sounded absurd but apparently she is being serious. The role that I play I think is the role of older sibling (which I am!) with an absent father, that's all.

I was told by my sister that she has overheard their mother talking to her aunt that her lawyer is going to sue me. It could be the mom playing games, saying that for my sister to hear and then tell me to scare me into paying her money. She's capable of being manipulative.

Assuming she is being serious in her attempts to take legal action to get child support from me, what should I expect? And how do I prepare myself now?",legaladvice
"Final Update - PA - Wind damaged house, tenants refused to move, they tried to sue us and the Judge yelled at them","PA

Previous follow up post here - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/83xbg1/pa_update_storm_damaged_house_the_tenants_are_out/

It is done, and my father wanted to let you all know the conclusion of the situation.

House was repaired in a very timely manner and we ended up selling the place. In fact, I was able to convince my dad to sell all his rental properties (9 of them). He's so happy that he did. He's got a sizable nest egg to live off of for many, many years. Mom and dad are going on like a 30 day trip around Europe next year. 

So the tenants ended up suing my dad in small claims for....wait for it...$5,000!!! How about that!

Their son, who apparently is actually in law school and actually passed the LSAT decided ""as a resident of the affected home"" to be the one who did the speaking in the court room to the Judge. This did not go well. 

After a bit of back and forth between my father, the Judge, and the kid, the Judge scolded the son and threatened to call his school for his ""unconscionable, unreasonable, and childish behavior in the court"" if he did not back down. He went on to say something like ""your ill informed understanding of the law and disregard for (my father's) generous offer has put you and your family in a worse off situation...you should know better...etc."" ""(My father) offered you all an opportunity that many, many other land lords would not do, and you squandered that opportunity...shame on you, on and on.""

Needless to say, the Judge was mega pissed!

The 20-something legal scholar's mom was sitting next to him, she was crying after the verbal lashing from the Judge and kept mumbling to her son ""we should have just taken (my father's) offer, he's a good man, why did you do this to us!""

The case was thrown out, and the parents apologized to my father. 

So that's that. It is over.",legaladvice
"Mom is charging me $600 a month for rent, soon to be $700. Is this legal?","So my mom and I have been having a pretty serious feud for the past 10 months or so. At one point she decided to start charging me $600 rent every month to live under her roof. She says it also covers medications, health insurance, food (though sometimes she refuses to let me eat), and she also claims that it is compensation for her having to live with me. Also, my health insurance is about to get more expensive, so she'll raise my rent by $100.

Is it legal for her to do this to me? I'm still a minor, and since I'm in school, I have to find a way to get my schoolwork done while working enough hours to pay for the rent.

Should I try to find a new place to live with a lower rent (and yes, I am aware that anything that cheap will be pretty low in quality) and then get emancipated, or should I just wait and see what happens? My dad doesn't want to interfere, but he's told me that he doesn't think she's spending my money. If I wait until I turn 18, she might give me my money back as 'seed money.' If I get emancipated, I'm afraid she'll keep all of the money because she feels that I don't deserve it.

If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know, and fast. I'm almost out of money.

My Husband Knocked Up His Mistress,"Hey there, Reddit. Throwaway here.

My husband impregnated his mistress. She had the baby. She got a paternity test. It's his. 

The baby is a few months old.
She wants child support. 

How do I know this? She showed up on our doorstep with said baby and paternity results. 
I had no clue that he was having an affair, his affair partner was having a baby, or that he was present for birth and funneling her money from ""our"" savings. 

He is a stay-at-home dad to our two young children. I am the sole earner. 
If I don't immediately file for an at fault divorce (In Virginia), will I be responsible for paying for this child?

This is all very fresh and I'm on my phone- so sorry for formatting/grammar/content.

I'm going to consult an attorney next week, just looking for some unofficial answer so I can survive the weekend with my sanity intact. 

Edit: 
The reason I'm pretty sure it's a legit paternity test is that she has filed for support. 
And, oh yes. I plan to file asap and I'm meeting with my attorney Monday.

I've spent several hours plugging in numbers to the VA child support calculator. Even of I impute him a reasonable wage, I will owe him child support. Even if I have 80% custody, I will owe him child support. 
Even if he waives alimony, he will likely get a bunch from accounts/retirement/property unless he just walks away. 

He wants to ""make us work"", so I expect this is going to go downhill quickly. 

Thanks everyone for the advice. Pretty sure I'm fucked no matter what. The thought of having to (even temporarily) finance his ""other child"" was feeling like the proverbial straw...

My husband cheated on me with a 16 year old,"I originally posted this in a different place but was told I should come here

I've been with my husband, who is 45, for 17 years now. We've got 2 children who are 7 and 11. Recently our relationship has been struggling, bit deep down I thought we both loved each other and my husband had never spoken about or showed any signs of wanting it to end.

However, last weekend I took the kids away with me while my husband stayed at home. We got back home and everything seemed normal, until my husband's phone went off while he was in the bathroom. When I looked at it, it was a message from a girl saying 'I hope I didn't leave it at yours'. This immediately made me suspicious and I confronted my husband, who eventually admitted he had met with a girl who was just 16 and said they had kissed, but nothing more. But I later found 2 condoms, one in the house and one in the car, that I knew had not been used with me as they were flavoured and we had never used flavoured ones. So I'm pretty sure my husband had sex with a 16 year old. But even worse, he loves her and wants to end it with me to be with her. 

I just don't really understand it, she's 16 and I've searched her up on Facebook. She's a model and gets hundreds of likes on her pics and loads of comments from boys. My husband is not rich or anything like that, so what could she possibly want from a 45 year old man?

But they both swear they love each other and he wants her to start looking after our kids.

I just don't know what went wrong or what to do anymore

I'm from the UK, so the sex wasn't illegal

[RI]Wife paid $150.00 in copays for multiple visits to a doctor and xrays and was told she was fine. She went to get a second opinion and the doctor identified 3 different fractured areas in her leg/foot in less than 20 minutes. Is a refund possible from the first doctors office?,"She had fallen while hiking last month and for the first week she was in severe pain so went to an urgent care.  At the urgent care they took xrays and said everything was fine.  A week goes on and she is still in severe pain so I booked her an appointment at an orthopedic specialist.  Her first appointment she waited 2 hours and got an xray that he looked at for ~1 minute before telling her there was nothing wrong and just to take 'epsom salt baths' for her foot which was pretty bruised.  A week later she went for a followup with him and again she waited for 2 hours for him to see her for ~2 minutes and he said everything was looking better and she should be fine to get back to hiking.

For the next week she tried walking  bit with me but she was really in pain still and my wife is really fucking tough when it comes to pain tolerance so I got her an appointment at a second specialist.  She not only got in right away but the Doctor sat with her for about 20 minutes asking her 100 questions about the incident while she had new xrays taken and when he got the xrays back he found and showed my wife all the fractures in her leg/foot.

In Denver Colorado.

Hey everyone thanks for all your comments it really meant a lot.

So basically I filed a complaint with the hospital asking if this procedure was a normal situation.

I spoke with the head of ultrasound and another woman who was in Hr.

At first they told me their was not a record of who did my ultrasound but after looking it was a gentleman who's been employed for 12 years and is an expert in testicular ultrasound.

Basically they said he was going above and beyond  during my medical procedure by grabbing my testicles because he knows so much about them, and was trying to find the answer quicker.They also said that rubbing my penis was absolutely normal during the exam that i was having. (apparently i was also ordered to have a right pelvic exam for a hernia) 

I questioned them multiple times asking why there was not an a chaperone or at least an explanation of what was happening.  I also questioned if i was having a right side pelvic exam why was anything above the base of my penis involved. 
They apologized for the situation and let me go. 

20 minutes later another hospital rep called me to let me know a police report was filled about the incident and I will be hearing from them soon. 
So we'll see what happens.

New York - The teacher who assaulted my daughter 4 months ago was just arrested for possession of child pornography," [UPDATE] [I posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/75razd/second_grade_daughter_assaulted_and_bruised_by/) about 4 months ago regarding an incident where my daughter's second-grade teacher grabbed her and bruised her on the playground.

The school, of course, tried to minimize the entire incident and we had to fight to even have her class moved so that she wouldn't have to continue to deal with that teacher.

Yesterday, a notice came out from the school along with a press release from the state police that this teacher was arrested on 6 counts of Possession of a Sexual Performance by a Child. The arrest came after the second incident with a child where he supposedly made some inappropriate comments. 

This is a teacher who has been in the district for 30 years and had such a reputation for inappropriate behavior that parents warned us about him when we originally got our daughter's class assignment.

Furthermore, he was moved from teaching 4th grade to 2nd grade because 'he did better with the younger kids' according to other teachers at the school. 

The administration was less than accommodating in finding a solution. My emails at the time to both the superintendant and the teachers union were continuously ignored, and it was a struggle to even get her class moved, let alone any sort of accountability on the teacher's part.

After her class was changed, the teacher told his class (that she had just exited) that she was a bad child and they should not talk to her. 

I am absolutely sure that the district has been aware of the problems that this teacher has caused, and that my daughter and the most recent victim are not his only ones. 

You guys were tremendously supportive and helpful when I first posted. I wanted to update you and also see what my next step is in holding these adults accountable for letting this man around children at all.

[UPDATE] College roommate has camera in our room,"A little earlier this morning I had a meeting with the Director of Housing. He had heard a little about what was happening but asked to hear my side of the story from start to finish. Before I told him what was happening I let him know that I would be recording the meeting. There was a user that said I should have a back-up one recording and a decoy one. I did but it wasn't necessary. He said that was fine. 

So I told him start to finish what happened. When I told him that I had already met with the Title IX coordinator his face seemed to drop a little. And it dropped even further when I told him about what the Housing Coordinator said after our meeting yesterday. After I finished account of the story he asked a few questions, why I thought my roommate put up the camera, what I thought would be the best resolution to this situation, if I had any problem moving to a new place. 

We then talked about possible solutions and concluded that me moving to a new apartment would probably be best. Even though he promised that the camera would be removed I still want to move. I don't want my roommate to be able to mess with any of my stuff because he can't have up a camera anymore. And I don't want to spend the money to buy a camera and put up to watch my stuff 24/7 /s. All jokes aside this has put a bit of strain on my relationship with my roommate and I really don't want him to do anything to my things or deal with the resentment the rest of the semester. 

The director apologized for what happened with the RA, RC, AD and HC. He asked for me to not talk with my roommate about what happened tonight and assured me it would be taken care of this evening. He also asked me to come back tomorrow in the afternoon to sign a few papers, not sure what they are for but I assume it has to do with not pressing charges or anything like that, pick-up the keys to my new apartment, and update the Title IX coordinator on the situation. 

Thank you everyone for your advice I followed almost of it. I think this ended in the best possible way.

[Ontario] Update 2 -- Feeder employee.,"So for those of you saying this wasn't over, I'm really unhappy to say you were right. At this point I really just WISH this was over, I'm so overwhelmed and drained. Writing it all out has really helped me out, and I know you guys like knowing the ending to stories so I hope no one minds another update. Again, thanks for all of your support during this. I do read everything in BOLA, I just don't reply unless I see people really confused about something.

Now onto the update.

Saturday Sarah's husband showed up at our building after dark, broke into the entrance way and was in the process of trying to break into our offices when the police showed up and arrested him. Thankfully the cleaner was in the upstairs hallway and heard him smash the lock on the door in order to get into the initial entrance way, then hid and called the cops.

According to the police he had a gasoline canister with him and they believe his intention was arson as retaliation for us firing Sarah. They wouldn't say much besides the base facts, however from what I gather (and also what the cleaner told me afterwards) he apparently flipped out when the cops showed up and was yelling incoherently.

The police called me and had me come into the station and relay my full story. It was awful and honestly really embarrassing. At this point they said there'll need to be an arraignment (which I won't be involved in) and then most likely a trial (which I may be required to be a part of) before we know what happens to him, but that they would update me as the case moves along when they can (like if he gets out on bail, etc).

The police are charging Sarah's husband with a handful of things (breaking and entering, attempted arson, apparently assaulting an officer and a few others) however my husband said we could probably recover the damages of the busted door as well. I also got together an emergency meeting for all the building / business owners and informed them of what had gone on (just the basics on Sarah's firing, not the details) and our business offered to hire a night time security guard for the next little while, which they agreed would be prudent. I feel really terrible about this now affecting them -- all of them could've lost their livelihoods. They were really nice about everything, but I can't help feeling like crap.

I sent all of this information off to our lawyer but haven't heard back from him as he's still on vacation.

We've still not heard anything from Sarah either, though all of her social media is gone (not blocked, we checked through an account she would have no reason to block) as well as her account on the website with the fetish photos. I honestly have no idea if she had anything to do with this or not.

So that's it. I'll see if I can update when everything is wrapped up (though some of you mentioned my lawyer may have me take these posts down), but if I'm able to it probably won't be for a while while the police and courts do their thing.",legaladvice
"Getting a divorce, an update to a previous story. (ohio)","Here's the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5j2max/my_husband_drained_our_accounts_and_wants_to_kick/

First, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again.  I will respond to each of you individually.

So, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family. 

The update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.

My inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would ""fix this"".

I opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.

I opened a new credit card in my name.

My mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.

I met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had *most* of the money back, and my husband was asking to ""talk"".

On the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.  

I pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to ""erase"" us. 

Keep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.

We have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.

My goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.

I also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town.  The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free. 

So, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was.  It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone.

My assets were almost split in a divorce that I was not a party of.,"TL/DR I own my own farm. My parents were in the middle of a very messy divorce. My mothers lawyer motioned to include my assets in my farm into their divorce. My step-father settled before it could get worse and the motion approved.

&#x200B;

I own my own farm in a family farm abundant state (ND). I am 25 and have a family of my own. I own 100% of the assets and memberships of my farm, besides renting very expensive machinery from him to farm my stuff, as I am new at it. My mother's attorney attempted to subpoena me, my insurance, my bank, as well as my other employer, who I work for to keep insurance on my wife and kids, and farming is very volatile right now. I of course objected to everything as quickly and efficiently as possible. Eventually, he subpoenaed me for a deposition, which did not go as well as I liked, because I did not want the invasion of privacy on my business like that. His farm expert was my mother who does not know anything about farming, and reacted as if my confusion to the questions were as if I was not farming, but as if my dad was farming for me. My stepfather could not farm a majority of his stuff as this same attorney encumbered him and he could not get a loan. I qualified for a government loan as a first time farmer and rented some land, equipment, and storage. I also found landlords that my stepfather was no part of whatsoever, in the sense that he never rented from them before. I also picked up my own land later in the year.

&#x200B;

After the deposition, my mother's attorney motioned to ""INCLUDE ASSETS OF ITHOMAS510 FARM IN MARITAL ESTATE.""

My mother's attorney continued to call my farm names such as ""alter ego"" and ""alleged operation"" in public court documents.

A week later my stepfather settled the case because of this and other things.  As I was not a party I could not submit anything whatsoever to defend myself or my business. I was completely defenseless and at the will of the judge and this attorney deciding what my family and my farm's future was going to be like. They attempted to include it into the marital estate with absolutely no financials, no proof of membership, no proof of anything really.

Do I have any sort of a case here? Legal Malpractice? Defamation? Slander of title? Heck, even emotional damages.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time.

&#x200B;

EDIT: 

I would like to first clarify that there was no transfer of assets into my name from my father. Everything I had was either built from an operating loan or a mortgage loan, both backed by the government through a grant which allowed me to borrow such amount of money. I did rent land from my father for above the normal rent price for our area as he could not farm it due to a lis pendans put on by my mother's attorney. The land I bought was bought from a different landowner. None of this was hiding assets or a sham.

I had gone through about 4 rounds of subpoenas to me and my banks to hand in all of my information for my farm. I objected to every one stating that there was no hidden assets and none of it was my father's, as well did the bank and my mortgage loan officer. This is probably why he went as far as a depostition.

The reason why the deposition did not go as planned was because the attorney and my mother did not have the farm knowledge to know the questions to ask. Some of the questions were similar to ""do you perform burn down?"" and ""what chemicals do you use on your farm."" I asked them to clarify all of these questions and explained myself but they used them as fake ""gotcha"" questions as I told them that they were too broad and didn't make any sense. There is also an issue where my mothers previous attorney contacted my father's landlords and he started to lose rented land. I did not want this to happen to my farm so I may have gotten a little hostile as I worked hard to network to get these landlords and did not want them being harassed. I did not try to be clever, slippery, or sneaky. He is an oil attorney and doesn't know anything about actual practices of farming, so when I said questions didn't make sense he twisted it into ""didn't make sense to me because I didn't know."" My attorney I had set up for the deposition had a heart attack, so I had to find one quickly, and he was basically there for the coffee.

I had stated to this attorney several times in affidavits and objections that all assets were mine, were never dad's before or now, as well did the banks and loan officers and he kept on sending subpoena's. I understand this is within his right as an attorney and is encouraged, but I do believe that as a person and business owner, I also have my own rights to privacy if I do choose.

I understand renting machinery was a slippery slope as ""if it's the same machinery then it must be the same farm."" None of his machinery was getting used by him due to the lis pendans. He recorded all checks written to him from me for the divorce. If I was not farming any of it, there would have been no money made between my parents on the farm. My rents at least put a little cash into their pockets.

I would not want to pursue action against this attorney further if I was ""hiding assets and being sneaky."" He had his right to due diligence. He did not have his right to include my assets into the court.",legaladvice
"[Oregon] Identity thief created a company with my identity, which is now being brought to civil claims court for 35K","I had my identity stolen in January of this year. I've already done everything I was ""supposed"" to do, like freeze my credit (though he just called and unfroze them, but that's a different story), rolled my bank accounts, filed a police report with a bunch of addendums with his activities every week, I got a lawyer and disputed all the accounts and inquiries he made, locked down my house and got a security camera. That is already all done.

Then today I got an email that looked like spam, some offering legal services for a court case that has my name on it. Lo and behold when I looked it up in my state's system, there I was, a co-defendant as part of a company I've never heard of, being brought to civil claims court for \~$35K over an unpaid car loan. It was filed 4 days ago.

The other defendant seems to be the identity thief himself. His address is in the area where all the other identity theft stuff has been happening - fraudulent car loan applications, an IP from a site where he tried to order a bunch of expensive stuff in my name, etc. It has to do with cars which is what most of his other criminal activity has revolved around (he has been trying to buy cars from dealerships in the area using my credit for several months). He has a foreign name and he had bad english on the other applications he made in my name. I have a strong feeling this is the actual thief.

The case itself - apparently he bought a car with credit, and stopped paying it almost a year ago. The filing claims that a tow company, owned by My Name, towed it and is in possession of it and will not give it back to the plantiff.

I drove by this address and it's a personal residence with some cars hidden in the back, but none of them look like the car in question, though I didn't get a close enough look.

I have NO idea what to do right now. Surely I am not liable for this? What can I do? Can I call my state's state department and tell them that the business was made fraudulently, and have it closed? I called my lawyer, who told me to go get the filing and get back to him, but he is a consumer protection lawyer, dealing with credit bureaus, and I don't even know what category this falls under, or what type of lawyer handles stuff like this.

Additionally -- since this is the guy that seems to have stolen my identity (who made a company with my information) -- can I finally get him? It has his address and name and other information, and so far the police in my area have done nothing but hem and haw because they can't find the guy -- well, it looks like this is him. Can I maybe finally get him arrested? I just want all of this to stop so I can get back to my life.

First off I would like to thank everyone for the advice they gave. It made me feel so much better knowing that there are great people out there willing to help.

On Saturday I contacted the dealership. They were no help and told me even if it was there grandmother there was nothing they could do. After the phone conversation I felt my next move was to go to the dealership with my grandmother.

At the dealership I spoke to the sales manager and the conversation didn't go well. I explained the situation to him and he said there was nothing he could do because they did everything legally. He said they could not discriminate based off of mental complicity. Then he went on to say that it was the same as him not being able to discriminate based off if someone was ""Black, Asian, etc.."". He then went on to compare it to them asking a woman to speak to her husband. At that point my younger cousin got upset and began speaking to him and he got annoyed then stated ""You are making me not want to help you"" and that ""If this is the case where were you when she was here"". I told him that we needed to step outside to continue this conversation. Outside of the room I explained that what he said came off extremely disrespectful and that the dealership came and picked her up so how would I know this was happening. A few minutes later I realized speaking to this guy was a waste of our time.

I did find out on the bank paper work it said $3,000 ssi a month which is way off. I confronted him about the number and he said my grandmother confirmed it. I asked her in front of him how much she makes and she had no idea. I asked if he verified her income and he said he did not need to. After I left the dealership I had a friend of mine who sells cars look at the paper work and he discovered they had her sign up for a $1700 service agreement even though the terms of the lease would have that car covered through the car manufacturers warranty. He informed me that it seemed they padded the lease as much as possible and that I should inform the bank that she can't afford the lease because it is almost 50% of her fixed income.

I called the bank which is through that car manufacturer and explained the entire situation. The lady on the phone asked me if I was trying to break the lease early. I explained I was just trying to get the lease nullified due to unethical business practice and the fact she not afford it. She transferred me over to customer care and I explained the entire thing there as well. The lady was helpful and escalated the issue to the regional customer service person. She said they would call me the next day (Tuesday).

I recieved a call on Tuesday but missed it due to being in a work meeting. I called the guy back 3 times yesterday and left messages. I also called him this morning and have not heard back. I then called her county APS office and explained the situation. They said they could not help and that I should seek out legal help.

Currently I am waiting to back from the customer service manager and trying to find a lawyer who deals with these situations.

[FL] Left a Google Review because realtor screamed at me over phone. He just went to my place of employment,"A month ago, a realtor screamed at me over the phone.

[FL] Ex-wife has been having all my mail forwarded to her house for the last 6 weeks. What will happen now?,"Hi,

My soon-to-be-ex-wife and I are sadly currently going through a pretty nasty divorce and custody battle over our 4yo son at the moment.

I'm not sure how I didn't notice this before, but today I finally noticed - that for the last 6 weeks or so, I have been receiving little to no mail.

I went down to my local Post Office to figure out what was going on, and it turns out my ex-wife has changed her individual forwarding from my address to 'family forwarding' from my address to her address, twice in the past 2 months. Meaning she has been receiving all my personal mail for the last 6 weeks. (For reference, she moved out of my house into her own house almost a year ago, and we have never had mail problems before). She never once contacted me or told me she had received my mail.

Presumably she would do this to try prevent me from receiving important lawyer letters, and things of that nature. Hoping to get the jump on me regarding our divorce in some way by obstructing my mail I guess.

The postmaster seemed pissed when she figured out what was going on, and asked if I wanted to press charges against my ex-wife. For sure I do, I'm pissed as hell. But my question is, will it actually go anywhere? Will it get taken seriously? What will happen?",legaladvice
[MI/NC] Bartender took my (real) ID and passport and won't give them back!,"I'm a NC resident attending a MI 4 year college. I just turned 21 about a month ago, and I went to a dive bar/music venue to drink and watch a show. I look incredibly young in person, but my ID is up-to-date and so is my passport as well. The bartender confiscated my ID last night because it looked fake because: ""it is out-of-state and your hair doesnt match."" My hair is currently dark purple, but in my license picture it's black, it looks almost exactly the same in a dimly lit bar anyway! So I tell the bartender I have a passport and he is confiscating my real ID and he says he will believe me when I bring my passport. 

I retrieve my passport, which clearly shows my age, and this time I ask to speak to the manager. The manager REFUSES to give my ID back, saying he's going to call the police to confiscate it, AND THEN HE TAKES MY PASSPORT. No, I'm not kidding, I wish I was. He went on a rant about how I tried so hard to act ""of age"" and had all this fake proof and a fake life. By this point the venue is almost empty and the bouncers kick us out. I now have 0 forms of identification on me.

I write a pseudonymous blog. Someone posed as me and got a book deal. I've been ordered to hand over my website.,"For the last three years, I've written a parenting blog under a pseudonym. It started out small, but over time I've developed a decent sized audience. It's not huge, but it's respectable. I write entirely about my family and my life.

A completely surreal thing happened this week and it's escalated to the point that I know I need to contact an attorney. But it's a long weekend and I can't seem to get in touch with anyone. I'm hoping to get some advice here in the interim.

Earlier in the week, I started receiving a couple emails from readers congratulating me on my book deal. This came as news to me, because I've never tried to get a book deal. I asked the readers where they heard this, and they pointed me towards a couple news releases that ultimately led back to a small publishing outfit. According to the publisher, my pseudonym will be writing a book on parenting, life, and other topics. Also according to the publisher, my blog would be moving to a new site to better integrate with the book. It reeked of rebranding.

I immediately contacted the publisher and basically asked ""what the fuck??"" Within a day, I received a cease and desist email from a law firm on behalf of the publisher. From the letter and a few follow up emails, this is what I have pieced together:

Some deranged person decided to claim that THEY were the one who wrote under my pseudonym. This person contacted the publisher and worked out a book deal. This person told the publisher that I was a paid ghost writer who occasionally helped with posts and managed the website. This person warned the publisher that I had become disgruntled because I was supposedly informed that I would be let go in a few weeks once the book deal went through. The publisher was warned that I might try to retaliate. The publisher was told that when I learned the book deal was final, I locked the ""real author"" out of her own website and that I was now holding it hostage.

I was warned that I had to immediately turn access of the blog over to the publisher or risk further legal and civil penalties. I've been warned that any further posts made under the pseudonym will compound the damages because the pseudonym now belongs to the publisher and I was fired by the ""real author.""

I'm baffled and scared. What's uniquely worrisome is that the firm somehow knows my real name. The cease and desist is addressed to me. I have no idea how they obtained that information.

Because of the threats, I've decided to go radio silent on my blog. I usually post once a day, but I haven't posted anything since Wednesday night. In the mean time, the new blog has posts. It's weird and creepy and just plain scary because they are posts where someone is pretending to be me. I've seen my traffic take a nose-dive as it appears many of my readers have found the new blog over the last few days.

I'm hoping to reach a lawyer on Tuesday, but in the mean time, what can I do? Beyond the bizarre happenings with the blog, I'm beginning to be nervous about my own safety. I'm in Virginia.

Does a child who didn't see one parent because the other parent stole them despite custody orders in place have to repay that time debt after age 18? Oregon,"Posting anonymously because I think I know the answer but feel like an idiot asking anyway. I hope I describe this clearly.

My parents split when I was very young and had shared custody about 50/50 at the time. My mother ran off with me to Canada not long after but cancer took her when I was 15. I was taken back to my father and was always told because I was away from him for eight years but he had 50/50 custody then I had to repay that time debt for four years after I turned eighteen. I took it as just how things are.

There was a letter from dad's lawyer that I haven't been able to find that I had when I came back to him pointing out I would be a minor until after I turned 22 and a few months. I'm not allowed to leave home much except to work, dad gets all of my money to support me, I'm not allowed to see guys, I'm not allowed a car, and it seems really unfair to me, and nobody else my age is in this situation. Does any of this seem legally real? The more people I talk to the more it seems my dad has me under a big con but I'd like to know for sure. I know it might be trying to prove a negative but is there a link to a law I could use to show for sure either way?

"(Iowa) Accepted into a grad school, one week before last day at work and signed lease begins I am notified that the acceptance was a clerical error and will likely be rescinded.","**UPDATE:** I finally got through to the admissions folks at the school and they decided to admit me without funding for the first year. So I am happy because I will get the opportunity to prove that I should've been accepted flat-out the first time and secure funding in 2020 hopefully. Thanks so much for all of the advice and PMs though! 

I applied for a few grad programs for Fall 2019 and was accepted to my top choice, a very close second choice, and a distant third choice that is also at the same school as the top choice. I received letters in the mail for (1) and (3) and an email from (2). I quickly followed the directions in the letter for (1) and emailed the head of the program, the program secretary, the head of assistantship placements, and also Professor X that I had been corresponding with on research. No replies from any of them, but I excused it because it was April and was deadweek/finals.

Three months later (two weeks ago), I remember that I have no information on my program that is starting next month and re-email Professor X asking about assistantships. He replies immediately and says that when I emailed him in April, he checked with the head of the program and found out that I wasn't admitted. For some reason, he didn't see it fit to respond to me and let me know that there was an error in my admittance. 

In talking to the secretary today (that also failed to respond to me in April), I find out that the program coordinator for choice (3) somehow accidentally accepted me to choices (1) and (3) -- secretary has no clue how that happened and thinks that it's likely that my offer will be rescinded because it is a competitive school. 

..I'm floored because #1, I quit a very well-paying and enjoyable job to go back to school and #2, I have already signed a lease in a city that I otherwise wouldn't have moved to. Further, if I wouldn't have gotten into (1), then I absolutely was going to accept (2) and move to a different part of the country. Now I'm screwed because I already have a lease and can't afford to pay two at one time on a student's earnings.

Do I have any legal recourse? Professor X said that he *knew* back in April that I wasn't accepted and just chose to never respond to me. The likely scenario now is that I might be able to get into my last choice -- but at this point there is no way that funding is still available. Let me know if there is any more information that I can provide.

UPDATE: I write a pseudonymous blog. Someone posed as me and got a book deal. I've been ordered to hand over my website.,"[Previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5uzlut/i_write_a_pseudonymous_blog_someone_posed_as_me/)

Thank you for all the advice to my last post. I especially appreciate the supportive private messages I received from IT experts and fellow mommy bloggers.


As for the update, unfortunately this problem has become too complicated for me to fight and I've chosen to walk away. I know this does not make much sense at first, but there are many personal considerations that have gone into my decision.


In the comments to my last post, I alluded to being worried about the financial security of my family. What I did not mention is that much of this fear comes from the fact that my mother in law was recently diagnosed with a serious (though hopefully treatable) disease. My family and the families of my in-laws are helping her through this difficult period.

But the difficulties are more than financial. This has been a very emotionally trying time for my husband and my children. Prior to this legal problem, my husband and I had discussions about me reducing my blogging or stepping back entirely for a stretch. The amount of time it took to write for my blog is honestly time that I need to put towards supporting my family right now.

So one consideration in my decision to not pursue a legal fight was the money and (more importantly) the time it would take. Although my husband and I figured the money would work itself out, especially if our case was as strong as everyone here said it was.

But the real reason I decided not to fight the publisher is this: I wrote things on my blog about my in-laws (including my MIL) under the assumption that I was writing anonymously. I was never mean, but I did state some difficult truths about their behavior and unintentional emotional manipulation. 

We came to the conclusion that any effort to fight the publisher carried with it too great a risk that I would be outed publicly as the author of the blog. Given that emotions are running high now that we are all caring for my MIL, it would be devastating if my in-laws  became aware of my writing. This concern settled the issue for us.

The publisher filed a DMCA complaint against my blog. Thanks to the advice of everyone here, I made a backup of all my writing for myself. Strangely enough, a (very poorly formatted) archive of old posts also appeared on the new blog run by the impostor and the publisher. It looks like they just used copy and paste. I sent an email to the lawyers saying that while I was not conceding ownership of the blog or of my posts, I would not be fighting them at this time. They want me to sign some papers, but I have told them that I will not do that. They seem to have backed off.

Honestly, I am heartbroken to lose my blog, but I would be more heartbroken if it became something that would create a rupture in my family as we try to support my MIL. 

Thank you again to everyone. Hopefully somewhere down the road I can begin writing anew.

After reading most, if not all, of the comments in the previous post I called the Director of used car sales on his direct number (listed on their website).

Initially, he tried to give me the same spiel as the guy that called me earlier, but when I told him that he should have had an inspection done before I left and that all sales were final and AS-IS as there was no other agreement in place, he immediately changed his tone.

At that point, he told me ""they only intended to ask for my assistance in approving warranty repairs if needed"" and ""they never intended to try and cancel the transaction"" despite both him and his salesman trying to do so.

I told him I wanted a canceled copy of both checks in the transaction, a copy of their evaluation of the vehicle, and a formal apology from their dealership in the mail. He agreed, and they did indeed send a letter with all the requested information (except the apology, but I'm not going to call them back up). They have also since paid off the remainder of my original loan as agreed upon and they've had the title reissued properly.

I do not know what repairs were actually needed or done on the car, only that the dealership that serviced the car (which is different from the one I sold it to) listed ""engine checked"" and ""multi-point inspection"" to the CarFax.

My ex died last night and her mother is blaming me and getting the police involved,"I live in Jacksonville, Florida, USA.  
My ex reached out to me last night via text, telling me her sugar was low and she needed help. I know she has Type 2 Diabetes, and when her sugar goes low she can't really think properly, this is the primary reason I'm scared of the potential liability.  
  
I thought this text was her just trying to guilt trip me again to come over and see her (she has a history of doing this, and I kept the texts.) So, I told her she needed to call 911 or her mother to help her out. She said she couldn't, that I was the only one who could help.  
  
This morning, her mom texts me telling me she passed away sometime last night. She goes on to tell me it's my fault since I was the last person she messaged and further, she is turning over the texts to the police because I didn't do anything to help my ex out. My initial thought was that there was something fishy and I went to drive by my ex's place to see if anything was going on, her mother's car was there, and so were several police vehicles. I didn't see any other, so I have no clue if this is all the truth, but it seems like a good possibility. Let the panic attacks ensue...  

So now, not only am I hurt over the loss, I'm also scared because I feel like it may be partially my fault and the police are going to come and ask me questions over her passing.  

I'm not sure how to handle this at all, any advice, beyond ""go see a therapist"", would be really appreciated, but some specific questions I have are:

* Can I be legally held responsible for her death?
* Should I reach out to an attorney?
* Should I reach out to the police?
* Is there anything, I can do to to stop her mom/family from sending me texts blaming me? (what I would consider harassing me about the situation)

It might be worth noting before questions are asked:  

* Yes, I have all the texts from last night.
* Yes, I have all previous texts from before showing her history of trying to get me to guilt trip me and manipulate me into doing things for her.
* Yes, I also have saved copies of them online in multiple places in case I need them later.

**EDIT/UPDATE**   23:04:33 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time) 

* She really did pass away.
* She tried to contact her mother about 20 minutes before reaching out to me.
* At that time (20 minutes before reaching out to me) her sugar levels were approximately 28.

The short version of the rest is that, the police have informed me that there is no liability due to additional evidence found at the scene. They also informed me that they have issued a (verbal) warning to her mother to not contact me with further accusations.",legaladvice

Today I received a phone call from the school, telling me that they are doing an investigation into a series of very serious incidents that happened last year and they would like to have the password for my son's Facebook account, also asking me to disable two-step verification if his account has it. They also said it would really be a great help if I hand over any phones, tablets or computers that my son has had access to in the last year, removing any passcode or login restriction.

I was shocked about hearing this. I asked about the incident and I was told that they can't tell me since it doesn't directly concern my son, that they only seek this to see if there has been any mention of it in the communications that my son has had with his friends which might help them uncover some information.

I declined. Told them that I'm happy to talk to them about the incident in person if it concerns my son but other than that this is very unreasonable and really none of our business. I was told something along the lines of ""I strongly recommend you to help us. This is a very serious issue for a few other students and to be honest with you refusal will have some consequences, I'm mostly talking about your son's future at the school in the coming school year and but also potentially legally.

I told her to send us what they want in writing. She said that she hopes we're not trying to make this difficult as ""lives are on the line here"", I insisted that I want it for my records. She said they might do that.

So my question is... WTF? They can't be serious about this. My instinct is to get a lawyer if we received anything in writing but really what I'm wondering about is how far can they go in this so-called ""investigation""? Let's say when school starts, my son takes a phone or iPad to school? Can they confiscate and look through it?

NY - All elevators broken in 19-story apartment building,"My husband and I live in a 19-story rental building in Manhattan, NYC that is very new - we're the first tenants to live in our unit, which is on one of the upper floors.

It is a relatively small building with ~7 units per floor, with two elevators serving everyone. One of these elevators has been broken for the past two weeks. The management keeps claiming that a necessary part for the repair is coming ""in a week."" While it's slightly annoying to wait longer for the elevator, it's been fine. 

However, the other elevator is now malfunctioning. Last night, management shut down this elevator too. People coming home had to walk up to 19 floors to their units. It's running again today, but the maintenance team expects that it'll be down again, and they're not sure for how long.

This wouldn't be the end of the world except that (1) I am pregnant and (2) we have an old dog who can't make it up all of those flights of stairs. If both elevators are shut down for any amount of time, we are going to take our dog to doggie daycare, and we might look into an Airbnb, neither of which are cheap in NYC.

If this happens, do we have any legal recourse to ask for a rent reduction or other financial compensation? I know NYC requires that all newish buildings over 5-6 stories have a working elevator, but I'm not sure how it works if the elevator breaks and the management claims (accurately or not) that they're doing everything in their power to fix it.

TLDR: Daughter was assaulted at school, we followed the thread advice, and let the school handle it. 

Today was the first day of the new school year. Last year, the young man that attacked my daughter was removed from the school and did not return. This year, he was back on campus, and not only that, was in a class with her. He immediately was removed from the room when my daughter arrived. But the fact that he was back in the school upset her enough that we had to check her out of school and bring her home. 

We asked the director of high schools at the school board office what options we had - he said he didn't want to let her transfer because 'she wanted to be there and didn't want to punish her' and asked us to keep her out of school until he could investigate. 

She's feeling a major violation of trust and no longer safe at her school. My husband is using his PTO time to try to get her taken care of, but it seems that a transfer is out of the question. The school let us down in her protection.

Here's where I need advice. My mother (divorced) noticed he was missing on a Monday and tried to track him down since this was very unlike him to vanish.

On that Wednesday she called his gym asking if he had been in (he had) and if his car was in the parking lot. They told her that it was not, that no cars had been there overnight.

Several days elapse, it's now Friday, and she finds his vehicle at the gym where it had been since Monday. He's in the vehicle and has been the whole week, this is in Minnesota and this time of year it's obviously very cold so on top of the neurological damage he's suffered from frostbite to extremities and damage to his eyes and organs.

He spent time in a coma before we ultimately pulled the plug and he passed. This has all happened in the past 2 weeks.

So this is where I need advice, do I have a case against this gym? I'm hungry for blood and I don't know what might have happened if we had found him when the gym was contacted.

UPDATE: The saga of the 3 year old and the EpiPen,"I really appreciate all the advice and personal stories shared with me last week. This is my first experience dealing with my son's allergy in school so I clearly had/have a lot to learn. 

I was able to get a letter from the pediatrician stating that the EpiPen must be kept in the classroom. The teacher now has it stored in a high cabinet, along with a written emergency action plan that details how and when to administer it. I provided her with a clear plastic case with a child resistant cap that I ordered from Amazon and was made for precisely this purpose. The teacher and the classroom aide were trained by the school nurse in how to use it. I also made certain that written instructions would be provided to any substitute teacher or alternate caregiver my son may be left with. 

We have a rotating schedule where parents take turns providing snacks for the entire class. The teacher has asked that these snacks all be peanut free. Neither myself or the teacher have asked that the other students make their individual lunches peanut free; I simply requested that my son be seated away from anyone eating food containing peanuts. Since each little table only seats 4 kids, this has been easy to implement. 

I also provided a second EpiPen, a bottle of liquid Benadryl and a copy of the emergency plan to the front office. I also confirmed that multiple adults at the school have access to the medications locked in the office and are trained to administer them if necessary. 

Most of the advice I received on my original post was very supportive and helpful. However I was baffled by the amount of judgement and criticism I received from the rest of the comments. For those of you who suggested that my son doesn't have the right to be enrolled in school, I hope you never have a loved one with an allergy, a disability or a learning difference. For those of you who thought I was advocating for my THREE YEAR OLD to inject himself, I recommend that you brush up on your reading comprehension skills. For those of you that thought I was being reckless by putting the EpiPen in his backpack...maybe you had a point. Its true that I never considered another child would get ahold of it or that my son would lose it. I took your words to heart and found a solution we can all live with.

Also, apparently a decision was made more than 30 days before we received the letter about the petition that my wife was the liable party (I forgot about this). When my wife heard about the decision, they asked for an appeal, and was told that the law office didn't want to go through with the appeal, and were going to go higher up in the office to see if they were going to continue to represent my wife. This letter is how we found out they weren't. My wife is currently trying to get in contact with the lawyer to see if they ever filed the appeal.

I am the plaintiff in a slip and fall case in Pennsylvania. Back in January of 2015, I slipped and fell on an untreated ice-covered sidewalk, causing several severe hernias in my spine. I've been in and out of a wheelchair, depending on how the hernia has shifted over time, as well as dealing with excruciating pain, physical therapy, steroid injections, and heavy pain meds. My doctor finally decided, after four years, that back surgery couldn't be avoided, so I got it scheduled, and called my lawyer to let them know.

I had an arbitration hearing two weeks after my surgery, which my lawyer told me that he was going to have postponed, to give me a chance to heal a bit. My lawyer's office called me the night before my hearing that was supposed to be rescheduled to remind me about said hearing. I tried telling them that the hearing was supposed to be rescheduled, but they were just a receptionist, and my lawyer was unreachable at the time. I went to the hearing anyway, because otherwise, the court could have thrown out my case, and I couldn't reach anyone before the hearing because the law office didn't open until an hour after my hearing began.

At the hearing, I found out that not only had my lawyer failed to postpone the hearing, he also failed to notify the opposing counsel that I had just had surgery, leading to the fact that I had surgery being thrown out as evidence, severely hurting my case.

I just got a letter from my lawyer's office, telling me that they petitioned the court to drop me as a client, which the court allowed. Now I'm stuck without a lawyer, with an important fact in my case unable to even be mentioned. Is there anything I can do to salvage this, or am I totally screwed because my lawyer messed up?",legaladvice

"Sister's parents want to sue me for turning my sister gay (I'm not kidding), do I have anything to worry about?","State of Georgia.

She is my half biological sister through our biological father, but she has been adopted by her biological mother's husband. So her parents are not my parents. 

Two years ago when my sister was 15 I discovered that she was sleeping with a girl, I kept this a secret knowing that her parents will not be supportive and offered her and her girlfriend to meet and hang out at my place to make sure they're not discovered.

But now 2 years later the secret is out and her parents have discovered that I've known for 2 years and covered for her, so they're convinced that if they had intervened sooner (like when she was 15) they could have ""cured"" her more easily and they'd have more time with her under their guardianship (sister is now 17 years and 10 months old) to put her through ""treatment"" for being gay.

My sister told me that her parents are seeing a lawyer to sue me for all the distress that my sister being gay has caused them.

TX - I am a private investigator who was hired to find the biological parents of a person adoped in the 80s. Found out his bio dad is the same bio dad as his wife.,"So this guy is not actually a client, just very good friend whoI have been helping over the years try to find his parents in my spare time. 

This is important. 

He is white, and his wife is black. 

In my investigation I learned that the baby was put up for infant adoption by his bio parents. Over the years I was able to track down the information. I will not say how and everyone will probably understand why soon. 

The medical records list the parents by first name only, but that gave me a starting point. It took a few years but I learned the name of his dad and it scared the hell out of me. I confirmed it a month ago, his dad is the same dad as his wife. 

I quickly buried everything I had and have not told him or his wife yet. I then tried to find out how a marriage license was issued as I know they check adoption records to avoid this very thing, but quickly found out the answer. A county clerk got lazy when she saw the mixed race couple and did not do her due diligence. This was a cheap JP wedding with a license issued in just a few days back in the early 2000s. I can understand why this happened as most people would not believe a white man and a black woman are brother and sister. Well half b/s anyways. 

I know that I probably have a obligation to tell them. I know the father as well and have been avoiding him recently. I am concerned about the legal ramifications in all of this. Obviously the marriage would be annulled, but what about their 2 kids? They have a 17 year old boy and a 14 year old girl. 

This is going to ruin the lives of 5 people here, possibly more. 

Moral obligations aside, do I have a legal requirement to report this? He was never a paid client so I have no contractual obligations to him. 

Basically I am just wondering how and where to proceed, or even if to proceed. 

EDIT: No I will not offer my services to anyone here through here. I will not tell you the name of a good PI, we do not hang out together, and I will not tell you how to do my job. 

EDIT2:Going to tell them tonight. Their kids have after school activities till 7 so I can get the dad over there too. ",legaladvice
I woke up this morning to officers in my house with their guns drawn. (Louisiana),"This morning I woke up to yelling in my house. I heard ""sheriffs department!"" At first I thought it was my Dad pranking me because when he comes over he always knocks like how cops knock. Anyways I was butt ass naked. I yelled back ""shut up dad!"" because remember, I was sound asleep and to me that was the first plausible explanation that came to mind when I heard that. I wrapped myself in my blanket and walk out to a deputy or whatever with his gun out. Where we live it is pretty quiet and we don't have many neighbors so sometimes when my husband leaves for work in the morning he won't lock it. I'm cool with that, I know tons of people who live around these parts who don't lock their doors either. Anyways he gets to asking me who is in the house, who lives here, what's their names, where are they etc etc. i was half asleep, naked, and scared, so I just answered immediately and honestly. After this little interrogation he then proceeds to tell me that they are looking for someone involved in a domestic dispute a few houses down. He said someone told them our house is an abandoned camp. It used to be a camp in the past, but we have been here since January, and I am outside for hours every single day in my garden. There are baby toys, a trash can that has to be paid for, etc etc outside. I'm not buying it..


He then scolds me saying ""you should really lock your doors ma'am."" As if it was my fault he was in my house with a gun out. So, the domestic neighbor thing... I have one neighbor directly across the highway from me. I know these people, it wasn't them. I have about three neighbors on the same side of the highway as me, but still across the street.. whatever this dispute was it had to have happened almost if not more than a mile away. When I filed a complaint later they would not tell me where exactly this happened. They told me that I should be happy that this officer trespassed in my house because if I had been being held hostage they would have saved me. I asked if he was armed and they said that they didn't know but just assumed he was. They never cleared the house though. If they were so concerned I think that they would have made sure that there wasn't someone else like my son in the house being held hostage, and that maybe I was being forced to say that I was alone.. They are saying that they assumed the worst but did not act like it.


So here's the icing on the cake. They claimed they knocked and nobody responded so they felt they needed to come in. Problem is, I have an incredibly loud dog that alerts me to the slightest sound. She never barked until they started yelling. I also have a baby monitor webcam recording constantly that recorded all of the audio. They never knocked.

Weird slightly racist neighbor- Pennsylvania,"Okay so I posted here before about this a while back, but now I wanna ask you guys some advice about something..

A little backstory, bought my house in February 2019. All was cool but then I started having problems with my elderly neighbor's 40 year old daughter that still acts like shes 20. Driving through my property, trespassing constantly, parking in my driveway. The driveway is between our two houses and there is no fence or anything as of yet, something I will be remedying soon. Bringing all sorts of trash over to her house to talk shit about me and my family because I won't let them trespass on my property.

According to my other neighbors this is a constant problem, and always has been. She used to do the same thing to the 93 year old man that lived in this house. Yelling at him, and even ran over his grill with her car once. He seemed to never do anything, except put up a fence in the back that was rotting and falling when I bought the house, and home insurance made me take it down prior to purchasing the home. 

I have never had any issues with any of my neighbors in all the places I've lived, and so this is a fairly new phenomenon to me. Well, anyway the problem came to a head when I called the police on them one night because she was sitting in my driveway in a car with a bunch of shady individuals. Earlier that day she had threatened to have someone ""come talk to me"" because I said I would be putting a gate in the driveway. 

They have no longer parked their cars in my property since this occurred, but now even though i don't even look in their general direction or even acknowledge them, this woman continues to talk trash and try to intimidate me. I have cameras on the property and have recorded every time she has been on my property without permission. It usually happens when I am not here. I had a survey done, and had the property marked and pinned, and this seems to have made the problem worse. She brings her weird druggy friends over and they stand around and point at the survey marks and talk trash loudly. 

Yesterday she started yelling racist things outside her home when my kitchen window was open, specifically about my ethnicity and background. I have gone to the police twice and they always say the same thing, just file it in civil court we can't do anything blah blah blah. So my question Reddit is, besides video recordings, what else can I do to gather evidence against her? If the police won't lift a finger to help me, where can i turn to?

Edit:
I wasnt expecting this post to actually get so noticed so let me ask another question; is having an attorney send a letter of no trespass a good option here?

Pro-Life Group at 15 yr old's public school sex ed class - PA,"There is a lot to unpack here so please bear with me!

A few months ago, a Pro-Life group came to speak to my 15 yr old's public school sex ed class. This is just SOME of what we dealt with:

A sticker for when girls are ""in crisis"". It's for a NO ABORTION UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES clinic that makes it REALLY DIFFICULT to learn they are a no abortion ever clinic.

A brochure about STD'S that explains how INEFFECTIVE CONDOMS ARE AND HOW THEY DON'T REALLY WORK. 

A ""magazine"" that not only equates rape by incest w/regretting a consenting encounter, uses terms like ""pure"", ""clean"" and, I shit you not, ""lust of the beast"", it also gives FALSE medical information, does a bunch of victim shaming, and don't forget the obligatory ""if you masturbate, you won't be able to love your spouse and kids"". 

Gave the girls post-its to put on and off their bodies to show how everytime you have sex, you are less able to love your husband and kids.

Showed a slide show of famous people and told the class to imagine how different the world would be if their moms had abortions.

A straight up BIBLE QUOTE on a separate piece of RED paper

I called the school. I was told MULTIPLE TIMES by the assistant principal and Assistant Superintendent the following:

I am the 1st parent in 15 years to complain about this group.

They don't know who approved them 15 years ago. They don't know whether or not the group is reviewed for approval at all anymore.

It's not ""up to them"" to read everything that is given to the children in their school district from outside groups.

They ""don't have the time to review the medical info given to the kids from outside groups"". In fact, and I QUOTE ""we don't have the time to look at every piece of paper that is given to the students"". 

Not a SINGLE, SOLITARY ADMIN OR PRINCIPAL HAD EVER READ THE INFO

They do have a comprehensive sex ed program. I'll admit that. When I asked why that group specifically was brought in, they said to show the ""many sides"" of the issue. I asked for a list of any and all groups brought to the sex ed class this year. The pro-choice group is it and has been for years.

 I asked if they could bring a medical doctor from a woman's clinic to, at the very least, give the ""other side"" a chance to explain that condoms work and there is no chemical that is released when a man masturbates to make them love their children less (no shit on that either. it said that...ALOT). They said no. (note: they said they often bring groups in other classes to show ""other sides"". I asked what classes/groups/sides, etc. i got no current example but I was told it would be similar to bringing in a WW2 Japanese soldier to talk abt the war. I explained that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and committed mass atrocities during the war. I asked if they would bring in a German Soldier for WW2 to explain ""their side"" and he said i was being ridiculous!) 

I asked if I could be present the following day when they returned to the class. I was told no.

I asked if my daughter could record the group in her class. I was told no.

I was told it's not their job to make sure the medical information given to the kids in health class is medically accurate and it's up to the parents to decide ""what to believe"". Cause that's how facts work, i guess.

After WEEKS and threatening legal action, they finally said the group won't return ""to the school"" (they didn't say district), that they reported the guest who gave the religious quotes (but didn't tell me who they were reported to), and that it was done.

This group goes to 14 school districts in my area-MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. There is SO MUCH MORE to this but, for time, I just brought out a few examples. 

What can I do to protect other kids from this group? Do I have any legal standing to fight them and, if so, WHO DO TAKE ACTION AGAINST? The school for not caring about what the kids see? The group for breaking the law? The school board? The state edu dept? 

What do i do?

Edit:
I am looking to take is to see if they violated state or federal law.

I support ALL sex education as long as it's presented in a factual and accurate manner.

"(Brooklyn, NY) At what point to a contact the police/a lawyer about the mystery sack found buried under my back yard.","This is not a joke. I have pics to show the mods, if they so desire.

&#x200B;

2 years ago, my partner and I bought a townhouse in Brooklyn. We ignored the back yard the first summer - too much going on inside. This summer, we have started trying to clear it out, which is a real challenge. My home was previously a 3/4 way home (between a half way home and full independence for substance abusers) and the back yard was/is littered with needles, broken pipes, other drug paraphernalia, buttons, marbles (no idea), and a shitton of broken glass, mostly beer and liquor bottles. I spend a few hours each weekend day carefully eliminating the weeds, then digging into the ground for a few inches with a spade and a hand rake, carefully sifting through the soil, picking out broken glass and the larger rocks. We have previously found random chunks of concrete, as well as broken bricks, unbroken bricks and cored concrete blocks.

&#x200B;

Today I was digging and found a rock that felt fairly big, so I dug under it a bit with my spade, then got my shovel out, so I could lever the rock upwards and see if I could lift it myself or leave it for my husband. It ended up being about a 1'x1'x4"" slab of what I would guess is ripped up vintage hexogonal bathroom tile, set on a concrete matrix. An interesting find, but also irritating - we have so much rando construction garbage in our yard to get rid of.

&#x200B;

Underneath, I discovered some more tiles that are potentially vintage - a seaform green and some other small chunks that just look old. Mixed with the tiles in the soil I found 3 alcohol bottles, empty, open, intact. 2 beer, 1 that looks to be liquor. Also mixed in were big enough chunks of broken glass that I currently estimate there were 2-3 other bottles mixed in.

&#x200B;

After digging up that, I hit some weird rock. It broke easily, was uneven in thickness, but overall, quite thin. At the thickest, it's maybe 3/4"". at the thinnest, 1/4"". It breaks easily, I dig it out.

&#x200B;

I am now about a foot below the surface, wondering how far I need to dig to get to the bottom of this refuse.

&#x200B;

Under the weird rock, there's a bit more soil, then I see something pink and soft. I brush it off. Imagine an ikea bag, but sturdier. That kind of plastic woven and sealed together. But pink. There's some kind of sack below this large slab and all the other things I find. I don't know how big it is, I've only uncovered about a 4"" square part of the top. I have no idea where the sides are, or how deep it goes. It seems to be fully and totally sealed still and I think would require a good knife to slice open.

&#x200B;

At this point, on a hunch, I go back to the weird ""rock"". I break some, and find that what I was beginning to suspect is true. This isn't rock. It's hardened tar.

&#x200B;

So buried in my yard is a pink sack (maybe once red and faded to pink) of unknown size, covered in soil, then covered in tar, then covered in soil mixed with empty booze bottles, then topped with a large slab of concrete flooring, then covered with several more inches of top soil.

&#x200B;

My husband is working until 1:30am today, and once I realized that someone covered this sack with tar, I got freaked out enough to stop digging. I have no idea what is in that bag. I could be some previous family trolling us and making a weird time capsule. It could be someone's beloved deceased pet, I guess. Lastly, given this was a 3/4 way house that was run illegally and the man running it is now in jail, it could be all kinds of fucked up shit that I don't want to know about.

&#x200B;

So, my questions:

&#x200B;

1. Should we keep digging and open this sack on our own?
2. If now, lawyer first? or Police first?
3. If lawyer (now or later) what kind?
4. What should I be aware of in dealing with the police? Is it safe to explain the circumstances at all, without a lawyer present?

&#x200B;

I took photos every step of the way, from the moment the medium-sized rock I thought I was digging out of the yard turned out to be a slab of what looks to be antique tile flooring. I shared these photos and the surprise with friends online, as it started out as a ""look at this kinda cool, but annoying shit I found in my yard today!"" thing, before it went into creepy wtf territory.

&#x200B;

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Coworker is claiming my dish at a workplace holiday potluck made her sick and caused her miscarriage. Alabama,"A week ago I brought a dish to a potluck. Dish wasn't actually made by me. I bought it that morning at grocery store. It was a turkey salad. Expiration date not for a few days. Put it in the office fridge until the noon potluck that day. There were about 15 other dishes there. I don't know which ones she ate and which ones she didn't. The potluck lasted about an hour. The turkey salad was out about probably an hour and 5/10 minutes give or take. It was put in the fridge during clean up. 

No one else that I know complained to me about being sick. 

She apparently got sick soon after the potluck and went home. She is two or three months pregnant. She had a miscarriage. 

The turkey salad is old by now probably but it is still in the office fridge.

She thinks my turkey salad caused her illness because her doctor said she might have food poisoning. Her friend that works with her came and got the turkey salad for ""testing"". It has been a week. I mean it is probably going to be worse now that when it was fresher. But I don't know food science. 

Her friend mentioned me paying for the doctor bill. 

She sent me a text saying I should be careful what I serve. Like no one else got sick, I don't know.

Turns out that the priest was fully defrocked shortly before our marriage, for reasons no one will share with me. My husband says that at the time he was appealing the loss of his priesthood, but ""it didn't stick"". He (my husband) seems to have known the whole time that our marriage wasn't legal, looking at it as a potential out just in case, but he won't confirm this either way (I'm guessing if he did know it was some kind of fraud). My mother in law tearfully confirmed the situation, saying she didn't think it was a big deal at the time because she assumed the appeal would go through. I don't have any reason to doubt her about any of this. 

My husband is now saying that because we aren't really married, I don't have any equity in our house or rights to our things. Worst of all, since he insisted on getting paternity tests on our kids (7 & 4) as infants, HE has parental rights, but not me, since there isn't any proof that I'm their mom. Obviously I'm on their birth certificate but he says that doesn't mean anything because he has DNA proof and I don't. I don't *really* believe this, but I know that unmarried parents don't necessarily have rights without going through the courts so I wanted to check.

Original Post Here - https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3ysp6t/virginia_being_sued_due_to_separation_from/

Wow, I still cannot believe that this took 2.5 years to deal with. Fuck me, I am tired. This was all settled a few weeks ago. 

So we left off with Old Company threatening to sue me. [Your surprised faced when you learn they followed through with a lawsuit against both me and New Employer.](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tEjzh3Zdf_Q/V1ltIj4pt0I/AAAAAAAAheY/Xm9QfrhOWxkKv85iKg5vHfWRBMIV-0XZgCLcB/s1600/63594749.jpg) 

Old Company ended up taking us to court, their demands were that not only I stop selling to former customers for 4 years, but that New Company give them the gross profit as a ""finders fee."" They also made demands around me never speaking with their new sales people (I cannot help when one calls me), and they pushed for me to exit the industry for 4 years too. Their demands were all over the place.

New Company has a bright, young, and eager corporate lawyer who was itching to get on top of this. First he tried to meet with Old Company's lawyer, that went about as good as you can imagine. He then sent them pages, and pages of documentation as well as a few sworn statements from customers that they never want to do business with Old Company ever again. So they ended up agreeing to drop the suit and pay for New Company's Lawyers time.

Phufff...of course that did NOT happen. They doubled down! This time Old Company leadership apparently started harassing and threatening some ""current"" (at the time current) and former customers that if they did business with me, that they would be sued too, their services would be suspended, etc. Just a whole shit storm was created. 

So bringing it all together, Old Company still exists (honestly, I do not know how), and the Judge ended up more or less telling them ""tough shit"" with business coming to me/New Company and it leaving Old Company. Statements by customers were damning and basically lost the case for them. Yelling at customers and threatening to sue them on baseless accusations is not a solid strategy to one's business growth plans. Who knew right?

Judge tossed out the case with, his words ""Extreme Prejudice!"" and that he did not want to see this case come back to his courtroom ever again. 

I am still employed at New Company, and have moved into a Sr. Sales Management role. I am no longer an individual contributor. 

My spidey senses are telling me that this is not the last time we are going to have to legally wrangle with Old Company. 

After we won, Sr leadership from New Company took the legal team and me out to a very nice dinner, and thanked us all. Especially me for maintaining such professionalism, hence my new role now.

"I'm paid up. I'm a good tenant. Landlord and son packed up my entire apartment while I was gone, took door off hinges. No eviction, no notice.","Studio attached to main house. My landlady lives in terror of her meth-addict son, and lies to the police to cover for him. Sick situation. He came back to live with his mom, decided he wanted my apartment, tried bullying me out. Attacked me twice. Gaslighting me, terrorizing me for months. I got an assault charge finally and order of protection is going through this weekend. Mother's Day he came into my apartment with his mom's key, held me down, threatened my life, pushed me out. I came back a day later to my entire apartment packed up. Meth heads love menial tasks. All doors off hinges, including main door.

Cops come. He speaks for his mom, says 'Officer, he helped us pack.' Yeah, right.

I'm getting my stuff and just moving. This is too crazy to deal with. Not even going to fight it anymore. I did nothing wrong, he'll get my apartment, his mom will lose the rent she was making from me. Good riddance. It's a gorgeous, cheap studio, but not worth this level of insanity.

I know this guy is a thief. He bragged to me about how he steals a couple of times. I just know he'll have taken some of my things. I'm sure he'll have taken my nicest things, like my really nice-quality American flag, my box of old camcorder tapes I made growing up, my camera. I just know it. I'm terrified to be there so I just looked in the fridge and he had taken all my more expensive frozen foods, and my nice lamp was in his garage. My mini fridge is gone.

The cop said it was a he said she said. He doesn't know if I helped them pack or not. But another cop in the dept. knows this guy is crazy. And he's the one who took my assault complaint after I showed him an audio recording of this guy in one of his psychopathic rants.

Once I figure out what's missing--whether it's something expensive or something priceless for sentimental reasons, like 40 camcorder tapes full of footage... what do I do?

The cop who was there, who didn't know the situation, said ""this is a civil matter"" and told me ""Hey man, my ex wife threw out all my stuff one day, and it sucks, but it happens."" I handled it well, didn't call him a fucking idiot, just said ""Ok,"" and left with my lamp.

[NY] I'm being evicted for violating my apartment's no dog policy. I have no dog.,"I've lived above my landlord on the top floor of a legal 2 family triplex for the past ~3 years. We share the bottom floor (laundry, bike storage, small home gym) and both live alone. 

It's been a pretty ideal situation - we get along really well and he's been an awesome landlord. I'm also really cognizant about being a good tenant.

So it was a total surprise yesterday when I received an eviction notice (labeled 'notice of termination') along with a copy of my lease with the section forbidding pets flagged and highlighted. It was sent via certified mail and says I have 30 days to vacate.

I thought he was fucking with me at first (like I said we're cool and I don't have any pets) so I went downstairs to congratulate him on *almost* getting me.

He was not cool. He was really pissed and began ranting about my dog and how it's barking and running around has been keeping him up at night. I tried to refute this and it only made him angrier. He says he sees me walking the dog (a golden retriever named Steve) multiple times a day. Also he says we've had conversations about the dog and that I've been rude and aggressive when he tells me it's a violation. And worse, I asked him to walk Steve when I would be coming home late from work and he has the texts to prove it which he said he already sent me when he warned me (also via certified mail) that I needed to get rid of Steve. 

I seriously 100% swear I don't have a dog and I have no idea why my landlord suddenly thinks I do.

Is this something I should/can fight?  
Do I need a lawyer?  
How do I even prove I don't have a dog??

Thanks.

Edit:

Okay - so he just texted me in all caps ""YOU GOT ANOTHER ONE??"" 

I asked him what he's talking about and he said that he's watching me walk TWO dogs right now and waving at him through the window. 

It's 3PM on a Tuesday and I'm at work. Not walking dogs.

I really hope this is a fucked up prank (maybe would be kinda funny looking back) but I think I'm gonna stay with a friend tonight

Edit 2: 

I really appreciate everyone's help/support - and I'm trying to respond to all of your comments (especially since I haven't left this post pretty much since I made it). 

Sorry if I'm missing any but wanted to just say a blanket thanks because all this calm & rational advice is keeping me from totally freaking out right now.

Also my friend I'm staying with tn has a dog (not named Steve). Maybe I'm just delirious after the past day but I find that really funny.

Edit 3:

I need a break. This got very, very real - much more than I honestly expected. It seems obvious now that this is very not normal or okay, but I guess I really didn't want to see that and instead focused on the eviction itself and the sort of amusing dog thing. 

I'm not really thinking rationally anymore and I can't help myself or my landlord until I clear my head a little.

I texted the contractor we're using for the reno to make up an excuse and stop by to check on him (just in case) and then tomorrow I'm gonna take some action.

Thanks again, r/legaladvice. Both for the advice and letting me release my dumb stream of consciousness while this all sunk in. I get stuck in my head a lot so I think I needed this post to talk it out. ",legaladvice
[Update] Help. Animals were killed by neighbor's wolf dog.,"Here's an update from my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/88zvrf/help_animals_were_killed_by_neighbors_wolf_dog).

We had lost various animals to our neighbor's wolf dog. One of our sheep had survived the attack and we had taken her to the vet since our neighbor had agreed to cover the costs. She had also agreed to replace the other animals we had lost to her dog. The vet costs were more than our neighbor had bargained for an she decided she had done enough. 

So as suggested, I went ahead and sent a demand letter against my neighbor for the animals that her wolf dog had killed. I recounted our version of the events and asked to be compensated for the animals we had lost. I sent it on 4/6/18 and never heard back from her. On 5/21/18, I went ahead and filed a small claims against her. When I went to file, I had my demand letter and proof that she had signed for it with me. The clerk (who later turned out to be the county's Justice of the Peace) told me that she did not need those documents, only my form for the suit. That I would have to bring those copies in when a court date was set. At some point my neighbor was served. On 6/6/18 I received a notarized letter from her where she stated her side of the story and said she did not feel she owed us anything, since she had paid for the vet bill and her dog had been killed. She went on to put the blame on the fact that we lived in a rural are. And she tried to pass the blame on other dog's in the area that would roam with her dog. 

Now, I'm aware that I live in a rural area. But we haven't lost any more animals since her dog was killed. Our animals aren't constantly being chased by her dog. As for the other dogs she refernced, they no longer come into our property. Either way, we looked forward to pleading our case. 

On 6/15/18, I received the court letter with our court date. On 6/22/18, I received a call from the Justice of the Peace's office, the clerked advised me that I needed to bring in a copy of the vet bill. This threw me for a loop since I had not mentioned a vet bill in my suit and I was not allowed to leave a copy of my demand letter. Either way, I made copies of everything I had. Including screenshots from a video, where their wolf dog refused to leave the sheep carcass on our property. 

I had court yesterday, and I lost. 

While we waited for our trial to begin, she was catching up with the constable that was assigned to our case. While it is a small town, it made me feel uneasy that she was obviously friends with him. Our trial was in a small court room, my witnesses were not allowed inside until they were asked to tell their version of events. She was allowed to bring in her husband. He was allowed to question me and he blamed me for not telling him sooner. He was rude and arrogant. Their whole strategy was that I should have told them about their dog being a problem. The problem was mine. She also accused me of fabricating my story since for some reason the police report noted that we had lost 80 chickens when we had really lost 8. I simply stated that it was possible it was a typo, the whole report had errors. When she did this, I pointed out how her story had changed from the notarized letter she sent me. In the letter she stated that she had seen her dogs and other dogs eating something on our property but she drove on. When she got back from the doctor, she saw that there was a dead animal and she decided to come see what had happened. In court, she said that she stopped by as soon as she had see her dog attacking our sheep. What actually happened, she didn't stop by til she saw a deputy at our house. 

During the trial, she brought up that our dogs pee on our property and had photos of them on her property. I'm not sure how that was relevant but the judge took it as evidence. I'm not justifying that our dogs be allowed on her property. That's something I aim to fix but her property isn't even fenced off. So I'm confused at how this was relevant. Additionally, at one point her husband argued with me that I was probably just seeing a coyote on our property and that I had simply confused it with their dog. I confused a coyote with a white husky like dog wearing a red collar. 

The judge favored with my neighbors. She stated that I had no other proof that their dog was responsible for our other animals. That she had paid enough with the vet bill and that in the future I should try to notify my neighbors of what their dogs are doing. I needed to have photos ready of every single time I saw that dog on our property. 

I was floored. I felt like my case was built around their testimony. Am I wrong in feeling this way?

I appreciate all the help y'all provided. Unfortunately, it didn't bring me the resolution I had hoped for, I've lost faith in East Texas Courts.",legaladvice
"Someone at work kept assuming that I am transgender, harassment?","Location: Ontario, Canada

I work at a company that happens to employ a lot of transgender people. I am born male, I dress masculine, and go by he/him. Yesterday at work I was working with a new woman (was told they are MtF, which is fine). Yesterday they asked me what my preferred pronouns are and I said he/him. They then proceeded to whisper to me something along the lines of ""you pass very well as a man!"". It sounded like a compliment  but it made me really uncomfortable. I told them that I was actually born male and they just said ""oh"" and went back to what they were doing. If it ended here, it would have been fine, but later at lunch I was told by another one of our openly transgender coworkers that she had asked her if I was ""embarrassed about my previous self"". My coworker obviously said they vouched for me and said that I was born male and that it wasn't any of her business. She also told me asking about someone's ""dead past"" is incredibly rude and she doesn't know why she was doing it.

Update 6 - Washington State: Neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. What can I do? [It continues],"So my neighbor decided to throw up some nice floodlights pointed over his fence right at our bedroom window right after his court date.  In that time we have sold the home and moved to an apartment in transition to our new destination, far far away.

He turned on the floodlights every night at 10pm and they would clearly shine through the bedroom window even with the black out film, and really shone through our guest bedroom where my mom stayed for a week to visit. Police came out and took pics and drove by several nights to confirm they were still up.  Part of his plea deal is to not commit ""similar incidences"" and further harass us. This comes into play later.

I called the police and they ended up serving me papers saying I was required to be a witness in court.  Court day came, they were asking for jail time, and my neighbor's attorney asked for a continuance because he didn't have time to review the new info.

They granted it.

Second week comes around, we rescheduled for a special hearing with a pro tem judge.  Mistake.

Today was the hearing and the second time we all had to take off work to show up.  The judge immediately told the city prosecutor since she didn't have a formal briefing, that he was not familiar with the case and that it would not be heard today.  Typically the judge who does hear the city's cases is well informed and the prosecutor objected to this saying it is not a requirement, you knew what was on the docket today. The judge further mentioned that because specific charges were not filed and they were just asking for jail time given back onto the jail time they waived at the previous hearing, he wasn't interested in doing this today.  He read the plea deal and said that ""similar incidences"" is too vague, and should be thrown out and he didn't know how shining lights on our property was similar to whatever he got in trouble for in the first place. Then he mentioned he had court in Seattle in two hours and wasn't interested in hearing my testimony today.  Also, since we will be gone by October, he didn't see the issue in why we were even there - since we moved, we can't be harassed anymore so problem solved.

I broke down in tears of sheer frustration.  The prosecutor said I don't have to be a witness anymore and they would talk to the usual judge in the case.  And to keep in touch with her. When my neighbor walked out, he did a very dramatic prayer hands in the air, like he knew he won.  I give up again. We're leaving, it's over, I will never get my day in court. I will never know what I did to this man to make him harass me so deeply.  I will never get two years of my life back.

CT - Boss dictates weekend activities?,"Hello - writing on behalf of a friend ""John"". (x-posting to r/askhr)

In the past year, John started working at a new job. He loves what he does at his job but he's had some issues with some of the unspoken expectations that he has learned of as he has gone along (yes he is already looking for new employment). John works a typical Monday-Friday schedule with nights and weekends off. Occasionally during the times he's not at work, he will get phone calls from the people he supervises with questions. (Probably worth noting here that John is an exempt salaried employee.)

One weekend, John was moving into a new place and one morning his boss (let's call her Karen!) called telling him that he needed to come in to work because one of his direct employees had called out and there was no other employee at the same level that could cover. John explained to Karen that he was in the middle of moving and literally waiting for the moving truck to arrive at his new house. Karen told him that it was an emergency and these things happen ""sometimes"" and he HAD to come in. So John went in and myself and another friend met the truck at the house.

The next instance was when John was at brunch. He again was called into work to cover for one of his direct reports. He told Karen that he absolutely could not come in as he had been drinking at brunch, had not taken his car to the restaurant, and felt he was too intoxicated to drive. Karen told him that he should ""watch what he does"" on the weekends. John wound up calling all of his direct employees and found someone that COULD cover.

After this, John approached Karen about having some type of on-call schedule. His reasoning was that he totally understood that there were times that he would need to come in outside his regular hours but he felt that he couldn't live his life - he felt like he couldn't travel far from work, couldn't go out with friends, or couldn't be somewhere that he wasn't accessible by phone. Karen told him that ""this was nonsense"" and that he could do whatever he wants on his time off. John specifically pointed out the issue that happened with brunch and she told him that she doesn't drink and that she was ""surprised by his behavior"". John again stated he would feel more comfortable with some type of schedule so that if he knows he's the one that would be called in, he would stay close to his job and refrain from drinking. Karen said they would not be creating an on-call schedule and that he shouldn't worry about having to be called in since it happened infrequently.

So now we've reached the part where John asked me to look into this for him. Our friend group had planned an overnight outing (Saturday-Sunday) for next weekend at a location about four hours from where John works. Since John was not scheduled for those days, he didn't request any time off, figuring he would drive up on Friday evening and return Sunday evening. A few of us did take Friday off work so two weeks ago John asked if it would be possible for him to take that Friday off. Karen asked him why he wanted that Friday off so John explained that he had weekend plans and would like to leave a bit early if possible. Karen then told him that he could NOT go away for that weekend because she had weekend plans and he would need to be on call. He asked if any other employees that are at his level could be on call and Karen told him no because they also had other plans. Nobody had requested any time off because it was the weekend but I guess John was just the last to disclose his weekend plans?

From his previous job, John is aware of a Connecticut law that says people cannot work more than six calendar days in one week or twelve consecutive days ([https://www.cbia.com/news/hr-safety/hr-hotline-many-consecutive-days-can-employees-required-work/](https://www.cbia.com/news/hr-safety/hr-hotline-many-consecutive-days-can-employees-required-work/)) but he is unsure of how this applies to being on call. John is working on-site this coming Sunday so if being on-call counts as working, that means he should be allowed to not work on Saturday, correct?

Outside of this specific incident, is being on-call basically 24/7 even legal?

&#x200B;

EDIT: A bunch of people have been commenting that he should just not answer his phone. He did this once inadvertently. Karen called him at some super early hour (like before 5 am) because coverage was needed. He didn't answer because he was sleeping. She tried several times but a ringing phone will not wake him up. Karen proceeded to call his emergency contact (me!) at whatever ridiculous hour it was and she told me that she was a) worried about him because he wasn't answering and b) needed me to relay the info to him. I was half asleep so agreed but made him take me off as his emergency contact.",legaladvice
I think my company is asking me to do something illegal/unethical with another company's IP,"I do marketing for a manufacturing company in the USA (OH). I have known that my company offers knockoffs of other company's parts but since I'm on the marketing side, I never knew what was involved in that and I was told that these are not patented so they are ok.  I've also thought it was weird that we have very few technical drawings but thousands of parts, but I never asked why.

&#x200B;

Where I think the illegality is coming in is that yesterday my coworker gave me some documents and said he needed my help. He often alters technical drawings and it was my understanding that he was translating stuff from English to Chinese (he is from China and works with our contacts in China). He said he can't open these technical drawing in order to change the information on them. So he came into my office and asked me to alter some technical drawing. He wanted me to remove another company's logo and information from them.  He didn't say that, he had handed me a printed version of this document showing the information circled that I was supposed to take off in photoshop.

Not fully understanding what I was being asked, I decided to try to open the image in photoshop to take a look but it was password protected (which I later figured out was by the original company). He told me I should just open it to view the file, take a screenshot, and then remove their information. 

After inspecting the image and seeing ""all rights reserved"" on the photo, and seeing there was a logo circled for removal I looked up the company on the internet. I then realized this was a product from another company and that removing this information from the image meant my company was likely doing something unethical with the image. I went back to him  and and asked him to please explain what this was for and asked him who had told him to do this. 

He told me that the head engineer had asked him to do this and we do it all the time. It's how we get parts copied.  I said I don't do these things and this is wrong. He laughed and explained to me that we use these drawings to send to china to copy or to see if they will sell them to us, and if the other company's information is on there, then the part might be more expensive.  It seems like a weird justification to me and it feel like there may be more going on.

&#x200B;

Is this illegal? I feel that removing identifying information and sending another company's copyrighted images to a factory in China to copy from is wrong.  Is this something I should report and if so, to whom and how?   Can I be fired for refusing to do this?

I understand this may fall under whistleblower laws but I'm unsure where to go with this information.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Company is taking other company's technical drawings and removing their logos and identifying information to send to a factory in china to copy and asking me to help.

edited because I saw a grammatical error

Second edit:

I forgot to add that once I said I refused to do it, the coworker took the printed copy from me and deleted the files from the shared folder before I got back to my desk so I did not have a chance to make copies or document this.  I'll try to be more careful to document this if there is a next time, but this added to my suspicions that something wrong was going on.

"[UPDATE] [MI] I sell handmade items on Amazon and Etsy. A website is taking my photos and descriptions and selling them as their own, I am not the only one.","Last Sunday, I checked my Amazon account and started browsing the seller forum, and found a thread about a website that was stealing listings and from Handmade on Amazon sellers. I was curious and checked the website, and sure enough about 80 of my listings were there.

[Previous post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7kdvic/mi_i_sell_handmade_items_on_amazon_and_etsy_a/)

I had no idea my post would get so much attention! Most of the advice was very helpful, some was a little misguided, and only very little was unhelpful (to the guy who pm'd me because you're not allowed to comment on this sub, there's a reason for that).

The first thing I discovered that was incredibly frustrating, Amazon sellers are NOT allowed to watermark our photos! I am looking into workarounds, like printing out my logo on a card to photograph with the product.

To clarify a few things quickly: 
- I am not raising my prices to match the drop-shipper, it's not fair to my true customers and in all honesty a plastic bracelet is not worth $20 in my eyes. 
- I know that drop-shipping is legal, that wasn't the issue at all. The problem was they were using my photos and listings without my permission, some of which were outdated photos and didn't represent the items correctly anymore (mostly due to color changes, different materials, ect). This resulted in several returns that I have to pay the shipping on, and can't collect a restocking fee on. 
- When they make the order from my shop, they are creating a temporary account for their buyer. All I got was their username, which matched the shipping address. No easy way for me to determine if they were a direct customer. 
- I do include a business card with every package. I am also going to start including invoices, it takes an extra step to do but it's not something I should have been skipping. Etsy prints them for me automatically, so I was just being lazy.

I did contact their ""support team"" and got a generic message back. With the team of Amazon sellers I was working with, we all submitted DMCA takedown requests on Shopify, and it was resolved within a day. The website has been shut down, and we are much more familiar with how to take care of this in the future. I'm setting up a Facebook group for the sellers later so we can communicate easily with each other as well. I'm also registered on Pixsy now, which may help in the future if someone is using my photos for their own profit again.

In the meantime, I am taking a well deserved break. There are still a few orders trickling in, but I will tackle those after Christmas. I am sold out of ornaments and candles, and have had several good reviews popping up on Amazon which makes me feel great!

Ex-roommate put feces in my shampoo and which coincided with a mysterious rash that required a biopsy.,"[Oregon] To start, my ex-roommate was insane. We'll call her Insane Jane. She was a casual acquaintance who had a room open up in her two-bedroom apartment, and I signed onto the lease in November 2017 and we split the rent 50-50. It took weeks before problems began occurring and common spaces became incredibly uncomfortable. I moved my TV from the living room to my bedroom because of this, which then inspired Jane to empty the kitchen and move all the pots/pans, silverware, plates, mugs, cooking utensils, etc. into her bedroom and install a door lock in retaliation (she literally texted, ""if you can move your things into the bedroom, so can I""). I should've bolted then, but I'm stubborn and self-righteous as fuck, so I just bought replacements sets (served me well in my new apartment!) and hunkered down for a long war. 

Subsequent battles included Jane throwing out my food, rearranging the common space furniture to separate our respective possessions on opposite sides of the room (super creepy to come home to), leaving her music on blast in her locked room before leaving the house on the weekend, trying to move in her next roommate into the living room (on my couch) before I had moved out - standard insane Jane shit. In late November I developed a rash that I assumed was from the stress of my living situation and didn't pay much attention to it... until it became a problem.

The rash first was on my arms and chest but soon spread to my entire body; back, stomach, lower legs, forearms, and head, but not my face or genitals. It consisted of red bumps that didn't itch but flaked off, resembling psoriasis. One day in late December, my coworker - a nurse - noticed the bumps and asked me what had happened. I work at a community health clinic, so I don't know why it didn't occur to me earlier to ask my coworkers for an assessment.

They were stumped; MDs, NPs, and RNs alike. Anyone with a medical licensure was trying to figure out what the hell was going on with my body, but the consensus was that they *could* be chicken pox and I was sent home. I was told I couldn't return to work until I was deemed non-contagious by my primary care provider.

My PCP couldn't figure it out either and referred me to a dermatologist. He said it looked like Christmas Tree rash (I now know that that's a thing) or psoriasis, but wasn't certain, so he ordered a biopsy. The biopsy results indicated ""favored psoriasis"", so we chalked it up to stress and I was prescribed topical medication. This was mid-January. I moved out of my apartment February 15th to a one-bedroom in the same complex; some people saw the move strange, but it actually made the transition ridiculously easy and happens to be the cheapest one-bedroom that could exist in Portland (karma's a bitch, insane Jane!).

The landlord had already divulged to me that I was Jane's sixth roommate in two years, and that I wasn't the first to report problems, and while she agrees that Jane is a horrible human, she hasn't done anything to prompt eviction. Then, last week, Jane's new roommate knocked on my door to apologize for treating me so poorly and let me know that she was moving out as well due to the previously mentioned abhorrent behavior. She also let me know that Jane had bragged about putting feces, Nair, and other contaminants in my shampoo, as well as glass cleaner in my contact solution. My rash had resolved itself in early March.

I've tried my best to move on from the ordeal, but come on: that's fucked up. Like, what the fuck, Jane. My self-righteousness has returned and I feel like she should suffer some ramifications for her actions. I know the evidence is completely circumstantial, but if I have two individuals (Jane's current roommate and her coworker, who reached out to me on Facebook to corroborate) who will attest to what she did, medical records that suggest that it may have affected my health, and employment documents showing that I couldn't work - is there anything I can do to win the final battle? Isn't this legally considered assault? Could I present this evidence to my sympathetic landlord to at least warrant Jane's eviction?

Being Forced to Continue Fostering an Aggressive Dog,"I have fostered dogs for 9 years. I have three of my own and currently have a foster out of NY ACC (Animal Care and Control). The rescue I'm working with shall remain nameless.  

I agreed to take this dog back in April. In the shelter she was very fearful and shutting down. She is an overbred mama dog who has very little trust in humans. When she got off the transport, I leashed her and took her out of the van with no problem. She has been very dominant with my dogs, but they tolerate her and yield to her when she's bossy. She has no problem with me and is very trusting. She follows me everywhere, more so than even my own dogs. The problem is she does not like strangers, or males. My son is 14 and she aggressively guards me against him. He can't get near me when she is around. When I walk her she is reactive to strangers. She's a cute dog, kind of funny looking, and people stop me to ask about her, but her reaction is something out of Cujo.

I have told the rescue about this behavior and they have hired a trainer. The trainer came out to my house and suggested that I muzzle her and expose her to as much as possible. The problem is she is so completely out of control around strangers that it is frightening for people to be on the receiving end. I have tried several times to introduce her to people and she just freaks out. I thought perhaps it was because I was there, so I did a little test with one of my brave friends to see how she would react if I was not present. Still the same crazy barking lunging and aggression.

I am supposed to be training this dog to not be reactive to people. I am an elementary school teacher, not a dog trainer. Her aggressive behavior is far more than I signed up for. The rescue has been very abrasive and accusatory in that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to with this dog. I have no idea how she even passed the temperment test to ve released from the shelter. Again, not what I signed up for.  

I have appealed to the rescue explaining that not only does this dog not like my son, but I'm getting a foreign exchange student next week and I don't think it's a good idea to have this animal in my house. The rescue lady told me I am out of luck. And there is nowhere to put the dog. What recourse do I have?

Please feel free to suggest a more fitting subreddit, if there is one.

Pupdate: the dog was picked up today. Thanks to everyone that tried to help and offered suggestions. I ended up calling the shelter (NYACC) and they in turn called the director of the rescue. The director then called me to tell me that I have been blacklisted and I didnt have to call the shelter, and that I failed the dog, and I am a disgusting human being. Lol. 

The rescue was POUND HOUNDS and the director's name is Donna Darrell.  She's a tool.  

It's a happy ending for the pooch, not to worry. She is now with a trainer and will be getting the intense work she needs. I will miss her though. 💙

[UPDATE][NC] Boyfriend's mom threatening to call the cops over my heroin use...I don't use heroin,"Original thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7mglxj/nc_boyfriends_mom_threatening_to_call_the_cops/

6 months ago I asked for advice on my boyfriend's crazy mom threatening to call the cops on me/have me committed to rehab because of dry patchy skin on my inner elbows that apparently looked like track marks. You guys advised me that she didn't have the power to do anything to me legally, so that was a big relief. To take the pressure and scrutiny off our relationship, my boyfriend and I pretended to break up on social media and my boyfriend told his mom he had dumped me to focus on school. She was pleased, we were seemingly off the hook, and we were able to continue to date fairly easily (her being in another state) albeit somewhat secretively without risking her pulling his tuition out from under him.

I wanted to provide an update since things have come to a very sad and tragic conclusion that no one anticipated. My boyfriend's mom died from an accidental fall last weekend. She was an older woman—late 50's—but we didn't think she was particularly fragile and were both surprised by what sounded like a fairly short fall being fatal.

My boyfriend especially is dealing with some messy and complicated emotions. grieving both the mom he had and the mom he wish he had. I am doing my best to be supportive but I'm struggling a bit to be gutted by the death of someone who was only ever malicious towards me.

Apparently she had a considerable amount of money that she said in her will that she would be giving to her son, my boyfriend. I don't know all of the details yet because I didn't want to pry about finances at a time like this. But it's actually kind of awful because she never did find out we were still together, and I doubt she would have given my boyfriend the money if she knew. So even though I know it's horrible of her to be so manipulative with money I still kind of feel like scum. I am also worried that her will has conditions in it that will make my boyfriend jump through hoops to get anything from the estate, including something stipulating that he won't get anything if he's with me...which I honestly would not be surprised if that was in there, given what I know about her.

So...I don't really know what the future holds at the moment. It's still a shock that this has even happened.

tl;dr - My boyfriend had a crazy overbearing helicopter mom who threatened to have me locked up for nonexistent drug use. She has just died in an accident and I kind of feel terrible just for existing right now.",legaladvice

[Georgia] My ex-husband's child needs a kidney transplant and he wants our kid to be the donor,My husband had an affair with another woman and got her pregnant. Naturally we divorced.

He wants her to be the donor but I'm 100% against it. He doesn't care that I'm against it and thinks he can give permission for her to be the donor because he still has parental rights.

They're taking my child,"Hello legal redditors.

I need help. And I don't have a lot of hope. 

On Sunday afternoon, my wife suddenly passed away from congenital heart failure. She was 29. She has an 11 year old daughter. Her daughter's father and her were married a short bit but then divorced. 

With my wife's passing they said they wouldn't have me disappear, but that's not the message I've received from them. I've been texting my step daughter on the phone I pay for messages of love ("" love you kiddo""), and last night I was told to stop texting her and I can have this phone back.

They had split custody, 50/50 with not really an amicable communication structure. 

In the state of Kentucky, are there any laws or guidances for the step parent? My wife had no will written out. Anything that might give me reason or hope to step foot in a courtroom? 

They're going to take my little girl away from me. The little girl I've helped raise since she was in diapers. I've just lost my wife, and I can't lose her too.",legaladvice
Update on reporting Child Abuse situatin yesterday. Thanks your advice. Child has been removed from home.,"Yesterday I asked how to handle a suspected child abuse situation. I had nothing to go on but second-hand information about a text from my 8 year old nephew saying his dad beat him the night before but he said he didn't have bruises. My  nephew was afraid to tell the school because he was afraid what his father would do. 

After receiving advice here I called the state child safety hotline and filed a report. I didn't have enough information for them to submit it though. But then I got another family  member to call in. We also called the school and told them what was going on and (as the child hotline strongly suggested having a nurse look them over). 

We called the school multiple times as they didn't trust us and seemed uncertain as what to do. Finally though, someone at the school had the nurse look at him. They  found bruises and he had been kicked in the stomach. The school then called the child hotline too AND the police and my nephew was NOT sent back home.  I'm so thankful. Now we're trying to figure out how soon we can fly out and bring him home with us. 

I don't know the ins and outs but at least last night we knew he was safe. There had been rumours of intense spanking and beating going on for a while but because my nephew is out of state and has been so young we weren't sure what was actually going on and constantly encouraged him to report ANYTHING to their favorite teacher but he would always say there was no marks so he didn't think the teacher would believe him. 

We're so glad he was brave enough to text us and I'm even gladder this case didn't fall through the cracks. I'm sorry  my  nephew got bruises but those bruises kept him from getting sent back home.",legaladvice
[CT] daughter is suspended from school for 2 weeks and school will only let her back if she gets unnecessary therapy. Please help.,"My daughter is 6 and just started first grade. The school brought in a wildlife instructor to show them some animals. My daughter hates snakes and that was one of the animals they brought. The instructor told her to touch the snake. She said no. The teacher also told her to touch the snake. She said no again. Both the instructor and the teacher began pressuring her to touch the snake and told her they wouldn't move on until she did. She started crying and ran out into the hallway. She stayed in the hall right outside the door. This is the story from the teacher FYI, so I know my daughter isn't lying or exaggerating.

I got called into school and the principal said that running out of class without permission is an automatic 2 week suspension. When I heard the story, I asked why they didn't just let her not touch the snake. It seems to me that she had a fairly expected reaction for a 6 year old in that situation. They said that they were doing ""exposure therapy"" and were working to make sure she got over her ""irrational fears.""

I asked if there was any way that they could change the suspension, since I can't afford unexpected childcare for 2 weeks. They said that they would waive it if I could show proof of getting her therapy for her fear of snakes. Frankly, I can't afford therapy, and even if I could, there are many things that my daughter could make better use of than therapy for a fear of snakes when we live in a city and rarely encounter snakes.

I'm furious with the school and also at a loss. Can the school put her through ""exposure therapy"" without my permission? Would a lawyer help me get her back into school? Are there any legal remedies here? Please help. TIA.",legaladvice
Can I mercy kill my wife,"Sorry for the formating, I'm on mobile because we really wanted an answer.

My wife is currently watching her mother die of a slow and very painful familial form of Frontal Temporal Dementia (FTD).  We got to talking about what would happen if she contracted the disease and she says that she doesn't want to live to the same point as her mom who is unresponsive, can barely eat, and is bed bound.  

The toll this has taken in her family is huge, my wife doesn't want out kids and I to have to watch her get to that point.

We live in Oregon, which is one of the only states that allow euthanasia.  However to go through with the procedure the person who is going to be euthanized needs to give 3 forms of consent.  

My question is, can she lay out her wishes in our Will?  If it gets too that point and I have power of attorney can I make the call?  FTD slowly strips you of your mental abilities until you are practically nonverbal, nonresponsive, and not really there...

"[TX] Landlord evicting me, has proof of my misdeeds because of his hidden camera","Many months ago I rented a nice quiet 2 bedroom house for myself.  A few months into the lease my boyfriend from out of state came and stayed with me for about 10 days.  About a month later my landlord started the eviction process because I broke the lease.  See, my lease clearly states no guest may stay with me at the house for longer then 4 days in a row and no more then 8 days in any 30 day period.  So, the landlord is correct, I broke the lease.

Our court date is next week, and I'm fighting the eviction because that seems like a bad clause and I like the place.  I figured he just sort of was being over protective of his house and was checking up frequently and noticed my bfs car or something, well it turns out that wasn't it.  See he e-mailed me today with a settlement offer.  If I moved out by Sunday he would withdraw the eviction, it won't show up on my records, and he'll wave all fees.  He said he could prove that I broke the lease and sent 10 photos, one for each day that my boyfriend was here.  Well, the photos are from inside the house.  I'm not 100% sure where the camera is, but based on what I can see in the pictures, it must be in or near the ceiling fan.


So, I'm pretty sure what I did was (probably) not so bad.  Though I'm very sure what he did is definitely illegal.  Now, my bf wants me to call the cops and have him arrested.  To be clear, I do too.  But I know he's planning on submitting those photo as evidence against me in court next week.  I want to let him, and then call the cops.  Is that a stupid plan?


Last little wrinkle, I'm out of state at my boyfriends house for the weekend, so I can't exactly consult a local attorney at the moment.  Which is also why I don't want to call the cops right now, since I'm not home to let them in and show them stuff in the house.  Please reddit lawyers, you're my only hope(until I can get home and deal with this better).


**Update**: First of all, thank you all for reading and responding to my post.  Second, I want to apologize for taking so long to respond, I needed time to process everything and to figure out what I'm going to do next.  


I have decided to fly home today, and when I get home I will contact the police and have them look around the house.

Mom's neighbor is intentionally being a nuisance to keep her house from selling (so he can buy it cheaper) IA,"My listed her home for sale two months ago. At that time one of her neighbors offered to buy it for $20k (her asking is 75). He says he plans to tear down the house itself to give him a large yard.  When she said no for a month he upped his offer to 25 and then 30k. 

She is not interested in selling it so low (it was appraised for 82). They got into an argument with him declaring that she's an idiot if she thinks her house will ever sell, she's lucky he's offering her as much as he is, etc.

However now he is being an intentional nuisance to keep it from selling.  The problem is, as far as I can see most of what he is doing is legal, like intentionally being extremely loud when he sees the realtor show up to show the house (but not breaking noise ordinance for that time of day, so legal).

But now he is being intentionally creepy and lying. He has been making a point to go over and introduce himself as soon as he sees the realtor showing the house, and the realtor reports he is blatantly hitting on women and men in disgusting ways, offering them the number for his security company because they'll definitely want something set up since there have been 4 break-ins on this block in the last month (police outright said that's not true to their knowledge).  He asked one lady if he could borrow money and very obviously hinted it was for drugs.

Mom has spoken with the police who say he's a crappy guy but not technically doing anything illegal and they don't believe she's a candidate for a restraining order.

I'm wondering if anyone here has any thoughts - if there's an option other than a restraining order or ANYTHING we can do.  Thank you.",legaladvice
[UPDATE] Falsely accused of rape by my Mom.,"Justice has prevailed. The police called me saying that they investigated and that they are concluding that the claim is bogus.

He tells her that it is not a good idea and that she can't just make an accusation like that and then proceed as if nothing happened afterwards. She didn't seem to get it and talked about the devil is trying to break up the family.
[Update #2] My mom called me again asking to come home or at least to bring her some of her stuff. I told her I can't talk to her and can't see her.

Original story is below:
So I've been taking care of my mom along with my dad for years. She has MS and her mental health has been tenuous for years. Talking to herself, and just questionable behavior in general but usually rather level headed. She once falsely accused a doctor of doing or saying something sexual during a procedure and since they're were like 5 people in the room during it. It was easily dismissed as well crazy talk. We continued to care for her at home. We attributed her extreme behavior to a thyroid condition/ the MS. I take her to specialists. She gets on medication for the thyroid and the MS brain... well I figured from what we read the confusion was apart of it but it's never been to the point where my dad and I didn't feel like we couldn't manage her.

Now fast forward to today. My dad is going through heart issues and has been hospitalized for days. Leading to today where apparently he tried to hurt himself and is now on psychiatrist hold in the hospital and won't be discharged today after all. I make the mistake of telling my Mom this. She seemed fine but like 2 hours later while I'm walking the dog. She calls the police. I come home to an officer outside of my front door asking to be let inside. I'm mentally like not again ( she had called the fire department like a year ago when my dad was again in the hospital about a non-existent fire) and I let him inside. My mom then proceeds to tell him that I raped her the night before. I'm like completely caught off guard. I tell the officer everything. They decide to take her to the hospital for evaluation. At this point, I'm just done. I really want nothing to do with her ever again. The feeling of betrayal is off the charts with me. She needs more help than I can offer. But now the police want my DNA.
[Edit:] I realize she's not well. My initial anger has abated and now sadness over just everything is my chief emotion.
What should I do? I'll give the DNA but should I get a lawyer? I don't have much money.",legaladvice

I received a phone call earlier this week that our dog had been found hit by a car on the side of the highway about 40 miles from where we live and had to be euthanized shortly after being picked up by animal control. She did not have her collar on but they were able to identify her/call us based on the microchip we originally had placed.

Animal control thinks based on where she found she was likely abandoned on the side of the road, as it's not close or easily accessible to any residential areas.  On Animal control's recommendation, we had them perform a necropsy . They are reasonably certain she had given birth in the past month or two, was slightly underweight from nursing but otherwise healthy.

"Update | [Florida] Realtors keep driving onto my property to show a plot of land for sale, they claim this is legal to do.","First, [here's my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3x7p30/florida_realtors_have_shown_up_on_my_property/)

And second, [here's my professionally drawn map of the property in question.](https://i.imgur.com/Vfsnkhg.png)

Lastly, thanks for your patience. A lot happened and I didn't want to ruin anything that was in the process of unfolding.

-----

I'm going to cut out a big chunk of what happened because it's not super relevant and I don't want to waste time. The gist is: the easement to the property in question is NOT on my property, but there WAS an easement there in 1986, however it was relocated when the property was surveyed and rezoned that year. 

Fast forward, I went to the realty office and spoke with the owner of the company. He was pretty douchey - bald, short, fat, wore thick gold chain and a huge watch. Almost like he watched 80s movies and picks up fashion advice from the villains. 

Anyway, he told me the owner of the property is very motivated to sell the land and that I should just buy it to get rid of the headache. The words he used and the way he said them immediately tipped me off that he was the one telling his realtors to pester me and go through my property and if I spoke up about it, I should just buy it myself. So of course I wasn't going to do that.

I told him that my gate is now locked to all trespassers, and that if he's lucky, I'll only call the cops when I see any of his employees on my property again. I regret saying that, but I was so frustrated with this guy, you don't even know...

So for the next week or so, I saw maybe two cars pull into my driveway, get to the gate, get on their cell phones then drive away. 

The next week was Christmas and I got a visitor. It was the son of the guy that owned the property, visiting from out of state. His dad (the original owner) had died a few years back, and he was now looking to sell it because he doesn't want to pay the taxes and/or do anything with it. Apparently, someone at the realty office told him of what was happening and he wanted to come straighten everything out. He was extremely nice and apologized profusely. I ended up taking him to a bar (this was actually a few days before Christmas, don't want to send the saddest image possible of two older guys drinking alone in a bar on Christmas). Learned a lot about his dad taking him hunting and camping on that property when he was a kid. It was really nice. 

So the property is about 80 acres in total, appraised at $280,000, but listed at $200,000. I told him I'd love to buy it and just keep it the way it is, maybe fence it off and add cattle to it, and his eyes lit up. I told him I don't have $200k sitting around and that I wouldn't feel right low-balling him. He kept pressuring me for a number, but I just couldn't come up with one that seemed fair.

Fast forward again, January 2nd. I get a phone call from the guy, asking if anyone has come to see the property in a while. I had almost forgot that the realtors used to pester me, and I was happy to report I hadn't seen any since we last spoke. He told me he took the listing off the market and dropped that realty company. He asked me again for a number, and I told him $100,000 was the highest I could see myself going. He said ""sold!""

So a few days later, he showed up again with his lawyer, we signed some documents, I wrote a check, we went back to that bar to celebrate, and my farm just got 80 acres larger. Very, very happy.",legaladvice

Update Bank gave away my entire banking account,"My original post was back in February about my bank giving away my account to someone with the same name as me. \[Link text\] [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atb2ce/bank\_gave\_away\_my\_entire\_banking\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/atb2ce/bank_gave_away_my_entire_banking_account/)

So I posted back in February about the incompetent bank giving away my account. Not much to report on the legal front, but I did report them to several governing bodies as suggested by helpful posters. The bank did reimburse my entire account and bounced check fees as well as opening a new account number with my money while admitting ""some fault"". So I got my money back and have not moved my account as some posters suggested as it is a beneficiary account my grandfather set up 20 + years ago before he passed that accumulates 5% interest.  So basically, if I remove it I will never get this type of interest again because these types of accounts don't exist anymore.

My update mostly concerns abut my personal situation, which recently become a problem. My husband and I are trying refinance our house, and on the equifax report... surprise surprise... THE OTHER WOMAN'S CAR LOAN IS UNDER ME.  STILL.  8 months later. Also, her current address.  Which means they did not fix any of this. I had tried to contact the other woman (non-confrontational) about this situation back in March letting her know her info was breached and she immediately blocked me.  No lawyers I had contacted were interested in taking my cases since they gave my money back so I kind of dropped it.  But now I've filed fraud under my credit report, and now have to fix my credit with her under it.

I'm not sure what my next steps are, but I re-filed some complaints under FDIC and am trying to figure out what else I can do, since clearly this bank isn't interested in actually fixing this situation.

"[NJ] Employee brought her ""service dog"" to work, and I fired her. Was that a mistake?","I hired a new employee to work at my restaurant a few days ago as a chef. She was to stay in the back, and handle the food and cooking. No mention of needing a service dog. But when she showed up for work on Monday, she brought a chihuahua in her purse that she said she needed for ""emotional support"". Right away, I told her nope to the dog. I didn't want that dog around the kitchen or the food. We argued, and I fired her on the spot. She screamed at me that she was going to sue me for discrimination.

So I told my lawyer what happened that day, and he sighed real heavily on the phone. 

""You fired a woman with a service dog?"" 

""A chihuahua. I think she was full of shit.""

""You know service dogs come in all shapes and sizes, right?""

Then I realized I fucked up...

Are there any laws about this in New Jersey? How screwed am I? Is she going to win if this goes to court? Just for clarification, can a chihuahua be a service dog? I find that so hard to believe.",legaladvice

I called our county's CPS office and left a message, got a call back in a few hours from the CPS investigator. I told her everything I knew up to that point and she came to my house two days later. 

She looked over everything in my house and asked some questions, then my husband and I signed some papers agreeing to be Nancy's ""temporary safety providers."" The county has since taken legal custody of Nancy and we are now her foster parents. 

Nancy has experienced a lot of neglect but she's amazingly resilient. We are getting things taken care of that should have been done a long time ago, and she's settling in here. If she chooses to remain in foster care until she's 18, she can go to college at any NC state college for free. She will be getting counseling to help her deal with all this through her school. CPS also has a program to help her learn life skills that she was not able to learn in her mother's home, like cooking and personal financial management. She needs healing from the damage that growing up in chaos has done.

[Ohio][UPDATE] HOA president threatening me for following state law,"OP - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6d6u1g/ohio_new_hoa_president_is_threatening_me_for/


Hello again, it's me with an update to my situation with the HOA president. I'll get it out of the way now - no, he didn't clamp my car and no, he didn't get arrested. As much as that would have been a more entertaining update I think this will still satisfy legaladvice for today.


So, my chief was pretty mad at this guy already, but when a certified letter appeared at the station addressed to myself and the vol. fire department demanding payment of fines and threatening again, IN WRITING, that he would clamp my vehicle, it was like a red rag to a bull. Oh well, as they say, never interrupt the enemy when he is making a mistake.


So my chief called a buddy he knows in the command staff at the sheriffs office, and they went over to this guys place with a couple of officers. I get the feeling that the deputies were probably more likely to need to protect the HOA president from the chief than the other way round, but there you go. It was explained in no uncertain terms to the president what the law was and what he was risking, and he has now backed down. The sheriffs also said if he tries to retaliate please don't hesitate to give them a call. There is a nasty letter from a lawyer that will be turning up on his doorstep within the next day or so as well, courtesy of the county director of emergency services and the city.


The rest of the HOA community has already come out and said this guy is an asshole, and they are looking at getting him voted out. I am very privileged to enjoy a lot of support from my local community for what I do and I definitely don't take that for granted.


I also want to go ahead and clarify some things that came up in my OP.


Regarding state law that says you must have sirens on while lights are on, I spoke to the chief about it and we are going to get absolute clarification on that from higher up the chain. I would also like to say I may have gotten confused as our department policy states that we must be using sirens while lights are on, however my chief does acknowledge that this can be counter-productive in some scenarios, so he will get the advice then review the policy if necessary.


There also seemed to be a little confusion regarding my vehicle. It is my personal vehicle which is fitted with lights and sirens. It does not belong to the fire department and is not overtly marked, however when I am responding to a call it is counted as an emergency vehicle. 


Finally, regarding my driving. u/mechdrunk I am truly sorry that happened to your sister and the I hope the volunteer who was driving was appropriately disciplined and his rights to drive code were revoked. As you said yourself, I am required to drive with due regard for other road users and safety, and I take this very seriously. My comment about hauling ass was probably a poor choice of words given that between my house and the main road where I have to slow down and stop anyway (STOP sign) is only about 5 or 6 houses. So despite all of the downvotes you got, I do take your comment seriously.",legaladvice
Texas. Terminated on vacation 2 days into a 3 week vacation without notice. Job refusing to pay vacation.,"We have 1 week of vacation a year that gets rolled over at the end of the year if it is not used. 

Well I never took mine in the 4 years I worked there, did not get vacation during first year, and collected 3 weeks of it. My boss told me I HAD to take all of it this year as he would not approve any vacation after the end of march. Basically we would get super busy april-may ish and hit a small lul first week of June and then busy throughout the year. Jan - end of march is dead time for us. 

Basically he said if I did not take it, I would lose it and told me it needed to be before april. I scheduled for the last 3 weeks of march coming back on Friday. 

I was terminated 2 days into the vacation by him after it was approved, but my access for email was never turned off. No notification came through, nothing. 

I came in today, my badge still worked, and started working. An hour into my shift my boss pulled me into his office and basically asked me ""What am I doing here.""

Proceeds to tell me I was terminated 2 days into my vacation for abusing the vacation system and that because I was terminated 2 days into it, I would only get paid 2 days of it. We went to HR, I informed them everything that happened and basically plead my case. They said it was already done and that I still had access because I was the only one who turned off access... 

My backup was not doing his job, and apparently did not know how to even use AD to turn off access. 

They tried to make me surrender my phone, and asked me if I would terminate my own access. I told them to pound sand and deleted the company email off of my phone. 

TL:DR Was forced to take 3 weeks vacation or lose it. Was fired for abusing the vacation system to take a 3 week vacation. Company did no terminate access as I am the one who does that. They do not want to pay me for my vacation days. Wat do?",legaladvice
[KY] A stripper pole was installed inside my office,"About a month ago, I was hired at a small tech company. When I arrived, I noticed I was the only woman in an office of at least 30 people. I just disregarded it as a coincidence at the time, but I now realize it was because of the workplace. I am intimidated on an almost daily basis by my coworkers.

Several of the employees have attempted to make romantic advances on me. These range from awkwardly asking me out (which I don't mind, but I am in a committed relationship, but they still keep asking) to ""accidentally"" brushing their hand against my butt. And these were not one time advances. Today when I came in, there was a new pole that had been installed in the middle of the office. When I asked my boss, he said they had discovered a ""sag in the ceiling tiles"" and that this was a temporary fix (although it seems a bit small for that), but after lunch several of the guys came up to me and one said ""why don't you show us why you were really hired"" At that point, I excused myself to use the bathroom and then left shortly after, saying I wasn't feeling well.

I could brush off the compliments and asking me out as awkward engineers being awkward engineers (and not getting the message after several times), but the brushing their hand on my butt and now this? I am furious. When I told my boyfriend, he suggested I post here since you guys would probably know where to go. Should I quit? Complain to the boss? Call the police?

Thanks in advance.",legaladvice
[Update][PA] Neighbor kid got bit by stray cat that hangs out in our backyard and had to get rabies shots. Parents want us to pay.,"[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8bmge5/pa_neighbor_kid_got_bit_by_stray_cat_that_hangs/)

So, the mom brought over a hospital bill the next week, like they said they would. I refused to take it based on the advice I got here. She wasn't happy about it, but she took it better than I expected, and I thought maybe that would be the end of it.

Then, two days ago, we got a letter from a lawyer's office saying we have to pay the neighbors $2200 and some change or they'll sue us. I googled the name on the letterhead and they're a real law firm, but they're located in a town almost an hour away from Philly, which to me seems weird because there's tons of law offices more local. 

Also weird is that the letter says the kid was bitten by a dog rather than a cat (we don't have a dog either). At first we thought they had hired the most inattentive lawyer of all time and it was just a mistake, but then I started thinking about how people on the first thread were saying that cat bites usually don't require rabies shots, and animal control would have come to quarantine the cat until they were sure it didn't have rabies if they *were* concerned about it. Now I'm starting to wonder if maybe they really are trying to run some type of scam.

Luckily, my dad has a friend/regular customer who's a lawyer, and he said he would help us write a response letter. He said that based on what my dad told him, it doesn't sound like they have much of a case, but we're going to meet him for dinner at my parents' house Sunday and explain the whole story to him then.

Thank you everyone for all the excellent advice! If anything else noteworthy happens, I'll provide another update.",legaladvice
Dog walker did not follow directions when instructed not to take the muzzle off. Is trying to sue for medical bills & pain/suffering. Thoughts?,"This occurred in Virginia.

A little backstory for more context.

I went out of town and hired a dog walker to walk/feed my dog. She advertised herself as a professional dog walker for 4 years. I advised her that since my dog was unfamiliar with her that the dog would be muzzled for her safety and for his. I specifically instructed her to not take the muzzle off. For clarity, he is able to eat with the muzzle on. 

A few hours later, I get a text message from her saying that my dog had bitten her in the face. This took me completely by surprise as I had taken the necessary precautions to avoid such a situation from occurring. 

I promptly call her on the phone to see what happened. She admits that she took the muzzle off to feed him and that she got her face close to him while he was eating. 

As a professional, I would have expected her to:

1. Get in contact with me before deciding that it was okay to take his muzzle off
2. Know better than to take a muzzle off a muzzled dog
3. Know better than to stick her face close to any animal when it's eating

She is now trying to seek full compensation for her medical bills and pain/suffering. 

What is everyone's thoughts/stance on this? Am I liable to compensate her for medical bills and pain/suffering? 

Edit1: Added location. 
Edit 2: Provided clarity that the design of the muzzle allows the dog to eat.

I knew something was wrong because I began to smell something in the hall, she had been in there four days.

While she was alive the building had tried to address the pest infestation in her apartment, as it began spreading quite rapidly. Anytime they tried to spray, she refused to let them in and I believe it's because she was mentally unwell. They served her an eviction notice but she died before the 90 days I think? She was always wearing the same thing and was dirty all the time. I called the LHIN (Local Health Integration Network), the city and anytime I had someone lined up to help her she would refuse to let them in, even though she would initially agree. She would speak to my wife but not me, but then forget everything she told my wife or that my wife said to her. We tried to help her but she would forget who we were. It genuinely makes me quite sad.

Anyway. She has died and they have been unable to locate any relatives, she literally had no one. Last night I came home and there were literally cockroaches covering her door and all over the hallway. Adults, babies and every other size. I called building management and they keep telling me to put in a maintenance request, this is has been there solution to every call we have placed. BETTER THAN THAT, they also keep telling me to get her to put one. In case you weren't reading, she is dead. They haven't even gone in to clean her apartment yet and a few days after the mailman delivered something and left her mail slot ajar, making the whole hallway smell of death.

[VIRGINIA]

Today was our day in court. We were called last, so we sat there for 3 hours stressing over it. Once we were called up, we were sworn under oath. The LL immediately requested a continuance under the grounds that he wanted to file a counter suit. The judge denied on the basis that he has not filed anything and he is welcome to appeal once the verdict was made.

I started by saying we were there because we had not received our security deposit or a written list of deductions within 45 days of the end of our lease and delivery of possession, which was in violation of § 55-248.15:1 of the Virginia Residential Landlord & Tenant Act. I mentioned that today marked 75 days out of our lease, and 60 days out of the date that the LL agreed to meet us to get keys. 

I handed over our text transcripts, transcripts of recorded phone conversations, emails indicating intent to not renew, forwarding address, etc. I provided utility bills to show we were paid up well before the end of our lease. I even included the receipt for the U-Haul truck we used to move before our lease.

In addition, I brought the lease, move-in and move-out photos, a move-in report, the statute I was citing for reference, etc. but we didn't even get to any of this.

When it was LL's time to speak, he implied that my phone transcripts were out of order(they weren't - I also brought a CD with mp3s but there was no way to play it. the judge mentioned i could file a request to bring me phone before the case. I will keep that in mind.)

LL essentially rambled on, didn't bring any evidence, and only said he sent the documents(with a timeline way different that he told us). Long story short, the judge was not having it and explained it is LL's responsibility to document everything. LL mentioned multiple times that we painted, but the judge said that she didn't care if we trashed the place because LL did not fulfill his obligations of sending notice.

He said that we owe him $2800 (not sure where that number came from).

I'm still full of adrenaline so this may seem a little choppy. I'm happy to clarify anything. But first, thank you all for your wisdom and guidance! We won!

 As we were leaving, it seemed LL walked into the clerk's office to file a suit for the $2800 he claims we owe him. What should I worry about in terms of this since a judgement has already been made?

Final Update: (Oregon) Can I sue my business partner in small claims court?,"Hello again, r/legaladvice. I understand you appreciate updates.

I posted several questions and updates throughout my saga, but [here is the (most relevant) OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/83a71m/update_question_can_i_sue_my_asshole_business/).

**The important points:**

* I was a minority shareholder in a small business in Oregon.
* I also worked in that business.
* I decided I wanted to no longer work in the business.
* The majority owner decided he didn't like that, so he ""fired"" me instead, froze me out of the bank accounts, stopped my distributions, and threatened to sue me to get back ""all the money I ever received"" from the business.

That was scary and frustrating, so I got lawyer.

**Now the update:**

After spending months trying to peacefully resolve everything and getting stonewalled, we filed a document inspection lawsuit in November to compel my partner to produce all our agreements and financial documents so we could at least understand what the heck he was doing and to figure out just how bad he was screwing me.

My lawyer (who's practiced for 30+ years) said he's never had to file an inspection suit before because, in Oregon, it comes with attorney fees. No one allows themselves to be sued for that because it's a big liability.

My partner dodged service for 2 months, so we weren't able to get the ball rolling until January. He had a lawyer this whole time, but they never agreed to accept service.

And then... more stonewalling. We ended up filing notice of intent to take default. The next day, they filed an answer to the suit denying everything and countersuing for attorney fees (which, apparently, they can't actually get).

In March, my lawyer's assistant was doing some routine research and just happened to find that the business filed amended documents with the state that completely omitted me as a member / owner.

He was trying to erase me.

My lawyer decided the best thing to do was to continue the inspection suit and file a new suit naming my partner personally for breach of fiduciary duty. That way, he could try to do as much useful discovery as possible under the inspection suit where we could get attorney fees back and use all that discovery again in the individual suit where we couldn't.

This is also the point at which he offered to represent me on contingency, which was a huge relief for me because he's expensive and things were escalating. He also credited the fees I'd already paid towards future costs/expenses, which helped a lot.

Even though the other side was making no effort to resolve the problem, that really felt like a positive turning point because I think getting a lawyer on contingency for a business / contract dispute is pretty unusual.

I later learned my lawyer offered contingency because my partner pissed him off and he wanted to keep turning the screws on him. He didn't want me to bail. I get the impression he's getting towards the end of his career and just likes to work on cases that interest him now.

Fast forward a few months, and we depose my partner. That experience pissed my lawyer off even more. I wasn't there, but reading the transcript was both sad and hilarious. My lawyer said it was the ""3rd most frustrating deposition"" he's ever taken. Oh well, guess you can't be 1st at everything.

After the deposition, partner's attorney got in touch to offer a settlement (he was on his 3rd lawyer at this point, btw).

It was a terrible offer so we said ""no thanks, but we'll do mediation if you want.""

They agreed, which is tragically comical to me. Mediation was my *partner's idea* that *I agreed* to before any of this insanity ever started. But he changed his mind at the last minute and I never heard from him again.

We spent a FULL day in mediation and, at the end, accepted a ""mediated settlement"" when negotiations broke down.

The settlement, once the contingency fee was subtracted, was not far from what I thought I was owed, so I was happy to accept it and put an end to an emotionally draining 2-year saga.

I often second guessed myself throughout this process and felt guilty for suing someone I once cared so much about but, really, he brought it upon himself. And I'm happy that I stood up for myself and am not spending the rest of my life asking, ""Why did I let him get away with that?"" 

My ex-partner has a very strong cult of personality that's served him well—he's very charming and can convince most people to do what he wants. I don't think anyone's ever stood up to him like that before, and it caught him flat footed.

The whole process was confusing because he never made a logical move until he was truly backed into a corner and was facing trial. At every turn, I wondered, ""Is this a trap? Do they have some epic strategy I can't see?""

The longer things dragged on, the more I realized they didn't. There was no strategy beyond ignoring me until they couldn't anymore.

Though my bank account is much healthier today, I have to say the money really rings hollow. I lost a friend and a partner in this debacle. But it was obvious I was going to lose that anyway, so better to have the money than not have it I guess! 

And I'm very thankful I found the lawyer I did. I probably could not have sustained the fight all the way through trial without a contingency agreement. I could tell he really loved his job and I think he's a little bummed we're not going to trial.",legaladvice
My mom killed herself. She told psychiatrist about her suicidal thoughts multiple times (quoted in records) but was told to come back in 3 months. She couldn't obviously....please help,"This is really important; so much so that I'm venturing into unconventional and unknown (for me) territory to make this happen.

So here's a little backstory...

My mom killed her self in September 2016. She was mentally ill and had been under the care of the same psychiatrist for 13 years. This doctor was completely negligent in his treatment of her, and continues to have this same ""standard of care"" for all of his patients. I got her records (which were incomplete and contained someone else's lab work) and there were at least 3 times she specifically stated ""I want to kill my self"", ""I want to die"", etc...she was never put into impatient treatment after stating these things. She has a history of suicide attempts as well as family history of suicide (sister). She was told to come back in 3 months for a med check.They knew she was drinking alcohol(stated 3-4 alcoholic bev a day, although that was a gross understatement)while taking Xanax and antipsychotics which is a HUGE no no and any reasonable doctor would have discontinued the Xanax at least, but doing so would have required her to be inpatient for a taper off of the medicine because she'd been on it for like 15 years.

So here's where I need help....
I'm trying to get a lawyer to take this as a malpractice case which is apparently pretty unheard of in the case of a suicide AND there's a 2 year statute of limitations on malpractice(at least in NC). I've had medical professionals look at her records and agree that this was incredibly negligent treatment and that the ""standard of care"" was not met.

...this isn't just about my mom, it's about the living people in my community going to his office and not getting the treatment they deserve. I believe people have tried to bring legal action against him before, but settled outside of court. I don't want to do that, unless he's giving me so much money he can't afford to keep his practice open.

I've spoken to someone at 1 office so far. I conveyed my information to a paralegal who said she'd talk to the attorney and he'd decide if he even wanted to look her records. This was 2 weeks ago now so I don't think I'm going to hear back from them. Should I keep trying to get someone to take this case? Or is this something that no attorney will touch and I should just start writing my complaints to the medical & psychiatric boards and leave it at that?

I've got a very limited amount of time left on being able to peruse this legally so any help is really appreciated. I accidentally posted this the first time in the ""best of legal advice"" and ""legal_advice"" so obviously I'm not that bright and can use all the help I can get from you smart people on Reddit.

EDIT: I KNOW HE COULD NOT ""FIX"" HER. THAT MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE PRETTY MUCH FOR LIFE. I'm not saying she should have been locked up and have he key thrown away. I know that inpatient treatment isn't a cure all. What I am saying is that EVERY OTHER TIME in her 13 years with this doctor she said ""I want to/am going to kill my self"" she tried and he knew that. He was aware that it's not just ""something she said"". He didn't even have her sign a safety contract 

I don't want to ruin his life. I just want him held accountable. That's it.

Literally all I wanted to know was if I should consult with multiple attorneys. I've received a TON of good information, but lots of redundant ""can't cure mental illnesses"", ""don't be angry"", ""I know nothing about law or medicine, but...""

Look, listen. Look and listen....

We negotiated terms that I could terminate the lease early if I found a new tenant for the apartment. (To sign their own lease). I did in December 2018. She never returned my security deposit or other monies owed-so I filed for small claims and subpoenaed her to bring copies of all rental agreements from 2018 to present. 


Yesterday was our day in court. I told my side, and she claims that the tenant I found for her signed a lease but didn't pass the background check. (?!) The judge asks ""do you make it a habit of running a background check after signing leases?"" and she says ""not typically, but u/rubbishtrashg was harassing me so much I just wanted to get it over with"". 

Judge: ""Did you notify u/rubbishtrashg that things didn't work out?

Ll: ""yes""

Judge:""How?""

Ll: ""... text message... I think""


Here's the thing. I was never notified, and that's a bold faced lie. She claims the apartment was empty until May of this year. However, the utilities were transferred to the new tenant in December (when the tenant I found signed a lease). Today I plan on calling the utility company for monthly averages to prove someone was in the apartment.


The judge didn't make a decision in court yesterday. He said he'd need a few days to review the statute and he'd send us his verdict by mail next week. Is it too late to submit evidence proving that my old landlord was lying?

Update: Thank you all for your comments! I apologize that the wording of the post is a little confusing. A few things to clarify:

The landlord is claiming the apartment was vacant from 11/2018 to 5/2019. This is what I can disprove. The utilities were transferred to the new tenant 12/2018. I just spoke with the utility company, they will provide documentation showing when utilities were transferred. I am speaking to a supervisor tomorrow about obtaining redacted records that show the monthly bill amount from 1/2019 to present, proving that there was an inhabitant. 

The LL claimed she sent a text message letting me know the tenant didn't work out. This is a two fold lie, which is why it's confusing in the post. She didn't send me a text message AND the tenant I found lived there for an unknown period of time. She signed a lease and had the utilities transferred. She didn't work out long term, because a different tenant signed a lease in May.

[NY] Woman has come forward claiming her child is my half-brother to try to get a part of my fathers estate despite the fact it is impossible. What can I do make this woman go away or pay for this stunt?,"Using an alt because this is just ridiculous.

So here's the situation. My father passed about 2 months ago from natural causes and left everything he owned to me and my sister. His estate is worth over 5 million with almost half of that in liquid assets. His estate is still being split up now (not because me and sis are fighting or anything. The two of us are just working together to see who wants what and figuring out what to do with the rest.) But that isn't the issue here.

About a week ago a woman we'll call Stupid bitch (SB for short) contacted my fathers estate attorney claiming that she had a secret child with him and demanded he get a third of the estate. I have never met this woman or even knew she existed until then but apparently she is the daughter of someone my dad went to high-school with so it isn't out of the question at first. But here's the thing, my dad was diagnosed with testicular cancer 15 years ago and had both his testicles removed. So unless this kid is at least 14 then its impossible it's his. 

So entertaining the thought I met with SB and was surprised to find out this ""secret child"" is 9 years old and looks nothing like my father. During this meeting she demanded ""her child's share"" of my dads estate and wants 9 years of child support in cash. She claimed she would sue if he wasn't added into the will. My dad's estate lawyer said that if SB's kid passed a DNA test he would bust she refused. She claims she has a ""secret letter"" from my father acknowledging this kid as his own but refused to provide it. 
The meeting ended with my fathers estate lawyer telling her to pretty much get out until she's ready to do a DNA test and her claiming she would ""see us in court."" 

It's pretty obvious this is not my dad's kid but SB is still trying to take from us. My question is, what can I do to make her go away? What kind of legal action can I take to make her disappear from my life. If she does try to take action against me and my sister, what can I do to make sure this bitch gets what she deserves?",legaladvice
"[Update]NYC. Frozen pipes in bathroom 3 days in a week, no toliet, sink (bathroom only) or shower water. Can I ask for a reduce in rent?","Hello everyone,

I got lots of good feedback, so I justed wanted to share the result. I emailed the management company the following:

> For the last three days, our water pipes have frozen leaving us with no water for most part of the days.
> When the plumber came in, he noted that the bathroom is very cold (it has no heat!) which is causing the pipes to freeze. 
> He advised us to leave the water dripping to avoid overnight freezing, which we followed.
> As a result, we now only have hot water on tap and in the shower with no cold water and no water in the toliet.
> While leaving the tap dripping is a stopgap solution, I am very worried about the water situation in the future, when the cold will get worse. It is obviously irrational to assume that the plumber will be available every time the water stops pouring at midnight.
> On top of that, of course, is the inconvenience and distress of having to live in a house with a bathroom with no or at best, scanty water.
> 
> I request you to look into this recurring problem and perhaps suggest a way to compensate for the distress my partner and I have been undergoing through the last few days. Our monthly rent is $2623, which brings our daily rent to $84.61; we'd like to be compensated for the three days we havent had water ($253.84) and for the consequent days the problem persists.
> 
> We plan on paying rent today, and look forward to hearing of a solution from you soon.

They got back to us today and **credited $350 to our account**. After the above email, we were out of water the following day as well. The plumbers pretty much spent 8 hours in our building making fixes. Shortly after this, they shut off water/heat for the entire building and made additional fixes to the boiler. Whatever they did has helped a lot, as our apartment as been toasty ever since, with no water problems.


A lot of redditors gave the helpful suggestion of running a drip to prevent pipes from freezing. A+ advice.

Thanks to everyone and take care.",legaladvice
"(MI, US) New employee at my small company has a service dog. I'm allergic. How screwed am I? -- FINAL UPDATE","[First Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4z4xfq/mi_us_new_employee_at_my_small_company_has_a/)

So, in the end, things went pretty bad for me, but I got some payback. Last post I mentioned boss was trying to work with me, and got me a temporary work space at another site. Turns out that was because he had just got a big order for some custom parts that I was really the only one qualified to make.

So, about two weeks into fabrication, he calls me at my new site and asks about how long I think the project will take. I say it's about two more weeks. The next day I get a call from him (and his lawyer), and say that the current solution can't be maintained, and ask me to give my notice to resign at the end of the month.

I know I probably should have said no and made them terminate me, but I was so freaking pissed at that point. So I gave them the notice that I was walking out the door, and hung up.

Cue my phone exploding. Calls. Texts. Emails. I ignored them all for the rest of the day. I got a call the next morning, asking why I wasn't at work. Told him I resigned. He tells me I need to finish my project. I hung up.

More calls. One from a coworker I really like. Apparently my boss is freaking out because it's a pretty big fab job for a repeat customer, and there's no one who can take over. They can't even return the raw materials, because I had already used most of them. Apparently, they had to eat the materials as a loss, and the customer cancelled the order. Another friend who works there told me that earlier this month several other people contacted our shop for very similar work, and they all had to be turned away. Guess who got laid off because, between losing the jobs and the materials losses, they couldn't be paid. Yup --- new employee and the dog. I feel a bit bad about that, but just a bit.

I wish I could say things are looking up for me now, but they really aren't. At one point it looked like my boss might bring me back as a contractor for that one job, but when I told him that the rate would be double my previous salary, he decided against it. Haven't had any luck with a new job yet. Things aren't tight yet, but that will only last another 3 or 4 months.

So, a bit of justice, but I really, really hate dogs now.",legaladvice

Update: Turns out dealership employee stole my car after I purchased it.,"Texas

Ok so quick re-cap. Bought car Saturday night. My salesman refused to let me have it till it was insured. This was at 10pm, one hour after closing. I showed him how my insurance covers the car for 30 days. He still wouldn't let me have it. Odometer at 101 miles.   They're closed Sunday.  I go Monday morning to pick it up. Go through financing (got scammed on btw), pull over to figure out the tech on my new car and see 380 something miles on it.

\---------------------------

After almost 12 hours and back and forth, it seems they are finally admitting my salesman stole the car from the lot on Sunday, took a trip and brought it back Monday morning.   They ""gave"" me two options. Neither are very generous.

1. Cancel the deal.
2. Keep the same deal get a similar focus.

I'm going there tomorrow morning. I'm most likely going to cancel and take my business else where, after I cancel the deal I'm considering calling the police and reporting the auto-theft, and then calling Ford and letting them know what happened. Tomorrow, I'm going to let them know that that is what I'll be doing, unless I leave ecstatically happy.

What I want:

.

1. Give me the same black on black Focus SE I have now but the one with paddle shifters (mine now doesn't have it), they also cancel the warranty and bring my payments back to 60 months (what I SIGNED for) instead of 72 months (what they sent to the bank with no signature from me). They then give me the warranty for free.
2. I'll eat the high payment, and 72 months, keep the warranty. In return they give me a ST (preferred) or  Titanium model.

If they won't do any of those I'm pressing charges (he's on camera sneaking into the lot and stealing my car when they were closed). I'm also letting their corporate office know what happen, Ford, etc.

\---------------------

BTW. Of the 50 replies to my original post, 49 of the 50 of you said I was being a idiot, to stfu and just let it go. Turns out it was exactly what I thought happened, my car was stolen and beat on for 300 miles. Sure happy I didn't listen to yall.",legaladvice
"[FL] My employer, (hospital), is requiring us to be at work in the event of a hurricane however we have been told that we will only be paid for the first 12 hours of every 24 hours we are here.","I am a nurse and I work in a hospital ER in South Florida.  In the event of a hurricane our staffing will be split between ""during"" and ""after"".  Prior to the arrival of a storm the ""during"" people are required to come in and stay until we are relieved.  That could be 12 hours later or 5 days later depending upon how long the area is affected by the storm and whether the ""after"" staff will have access to roads to get to work.  


I worked at one hospital during a storm and I was there for over 100 hours before I was relieved and I was paid for the entire time I was there.  They even gave us OT.  However, my leadership here is saying that we will only be required to be working for 12 hours per 24 hours we are here and therefor they are only obligated to pay us for the time we are actually at work.  We will not be allowed to leave the hospital when we are on downtime.  The hospital is setting up cots where we can enjoy our ""time off"".


This doesn't sound right to any of us.  My understanding is that if I am required to be at work, I am required to be paid.  I understand they are not obligated to pay us overtime until we actually work more than 40 hours in a given week.  But not paying us at all while we are at work seems ridiculous.  


I should also say that the hospital will remain open.  Closing will not be an option.  


I will also say that being available for hurricane staffing is a condition of employment that I and everyone else agreed to in order to work here.  Personally I am happy to be available during disasters as that type of dynamic is something I enjoy on a professional level.  


Finally, I have been through at least 8 hurricanes in my life including Andrew.  I am well prepared for this one.  I have water, food, cash, the shutters are up, the house is ready, the hatches are battened and the main sail is reefed!

Wife and I had IVF done recently. Possible HIPAA Violation?,"Edit: Thanks to everyone for their replies. We decided to file a complaint and let the investigating agency decide if there was a violation.   


A few months ago, my wife and I recently went through IVF. The fertility clinic makes it part of their process to test all patients for gonorrhea/chlamydia. No big deal, I guess.  Our real issue is that the lab company sent the bill to my wife's workplace. It was addressed to her, but her workplace opened the bill. This was really embarrassing for my wife, because the HR lady saw the bill; it only showed a line item for  ""Chlamydia/GC Amplification"". In an attempt to save face, she had to explain our infertility issues which is hard for her to do.

After making some phone calls, it appears that the fertility clinic filled the forms out correctly and the Lab company sent the bill to the wrong address. When I called them, they apologized and said they'd look into it. They followed up with us by sending a copy of the form the clinic sent in (which was filled out correctly). They claimed it was the clinic's fault, but the formed showed otherwise.

We were upset with this, but decided to just move on. That was all a few months ago.

Well, today, we received the other bill (I guess one for each of us. I don't know why this one took so long). This was, again, sent to my wife's workplace and again opened. Is this a HIPAA violation?

Liable for an apartment I was unaware of,"[Indiana] Am I likely to be financially liable for this? So going back to July of 2017. I was looking around for an apartment complex near my university. I saw an advertisement for a place that I thought looked nice. Everything looked pretty okay, so I sent an application in to be looked over. They sent an email back saying it was approved and said the following:""We have received your application and we're excited that you've decided to make (The apartment complex) your new home! Below is a link to your Housing Agreement. Please read through the agreement fully and let us know if you have any questions or need clarification.

We will email a completed copy after we counter-sign the agreement"" 
The thing is that I never received an email so I gave them a call. They told me over the phone that the unit I was looking at was rented to someone before me since it was one of the few units still available. Unfortunately, I did not think to get what they said in writing since I figured the situation was over. I moved on and eventually found a different place to stay for the school year. Fast forward to today and I see a ding on my credit for a $5100 from a collection agency. I did some digging in my emails and found an email titled final statement that I missed (originally sent on June 28,2018). It stated that my move in date was June 15, 2018, my lease start date was August 17, 2017, my lease end date was August 2, 2018, notice given date (empty spot), and move out date (empty spot). 

The whole situation is confusing, I never received keys, never spoke to them again, never received any emails or physical mail, never even seen the inside of any of the buildings besides the internet.

Friend is lying to her now fiancé about being pregnant. Is this illegal? [GA],"As the title states, my now former friend faked being pregnant to get her ex-boyfriend back. He left her a few weeks ago for another woman, and she ended up buying positive pregnancy tests off of Craigslist to convince him to come back. He did, and now he wants to ""make things right"" and get married before the fake baby is born.

He ended up buying her a $1,500 engagement ring, paid for car repairs (he didn't want to risk the baby's safety with her car in the condition it was), and she is now convincing him to buy a house so they can settle down and start their family. I'm sure he has paid for other things as well. I don't know the extent of her plans, just that she told me in person (unfortunately no written proof) what she had done, and the things that he has done for her.

On top of being morally wrong and her being a terrible human being, is this illegal? Could it be theft by deception? I'm working on a way to tell him anonymously as I'm one of a handful of people who knows. She is incredibly vindictive so I'm afraid of what she'll do if she knows it was me for sure. If she's willing to do something this awful to begin with, I worry about her retaliating and trying to destroy my business and personal life. I know there are only a few people for her to suspect, but I'd like to attempt to protect myself from anything.

On top of the question of this being illegal, does anybody have any suggestions as to how I can anonymously tell him without having his phone number and him having no social media presence? He needs to know, but I have no idea as to how I can inform him.

Edit: Found out last night where he works, and I'm on my way to leave a letter on his car. Apparently I'm one of five people that knows, so I'm sure narrowing it down to me won't be too hard, but it's worth the risk to make sure she doesn't do something even worse to keep up this charade. May be back with another question regarding libel/slander about my business if she does find out. 

If anybody else reads this, I do have another question. If he does attempt to sue her for the money that he's given her and he finds out that it was me that left the letter, will I be subpoenaed to speak to his lawyer to corroborate the story?

Edit #2: I left the letter with one of his co-workers as he was on his lunch break and I had to get back to work myself. The letter was in a sealed envelope, and I told them it was private yet urgent. I informed him of what I had been told, wrote down the link to the Craigslist post where she purchased the tests (the woman is still selling them for $40 per test), and told him I was concerned about what she would do going further. Thanks everybody for your replies. I'm hoping she suffers some sort of repercussions for her actions.

Edit #3: Mutual friend just called me and said she's freaking out because he's coming home immediately after work to talk instead of going to an appointment or something that he had scheduled. Apparently she's scared that he's going to break up with her, but hasn't been clued in as to why. She's thinking he might leave her for the other woman, and has apparently convinced herself that she's pregnant because she used the ""he would really leave me and the baby"" line, even though our mutual friend knows better. So I'm glad he knows, but I'm expecting a very angry text or call from her sometime within the next few hours. Just wanted to let everybody know what's going on, and thank you all for your advice and replies.

Final edit: He broke up with her. He came home, told her he had been having suspicions about her pregnancy, told her to take another test, and she refused. He said if she wanted him to stay, she would confirm with another test, and she still refused. My mutual friend has told me that he left, she's threatening to kill herself, and her mother has been informed so she can deal with this. Thank you again everyone. I'm still hoping this remains anonymous, but I'm sure it may come out at some point. Hopefully by then she'll be past this and have undergone some serious therapy.",legaladvice
[Update][VA] Question about neighbor's animal excrement,"Firstly, thank you for all the advice. 

I got a call from the HOA president last night. He told me my neighbor reported me to the HOA Saturday and requested that I be fined for stealing his pig's poop. The HOA board looked into it and found that ownership of anything classified as ""livestock"" was against HOA bylaws and against local ordinance. In exchange for not being reported to the authorities, my neighbor agreed to send the pig away to live with his grandmother in Idaho. He was fined by the HOA though for failure to pick up the poop.

My neighbor came by this morning to apologize. He said he had gone to a lawyer on Friday and paid $150 for a consultation and was told his case would be far from a slam dunk he thought it would be. 

I hope the matter will be closed, at least until I try my friend's naturally fertilized produce. ",legaladvice
I've have had the cops called on me 3x by my downstairs neighbor and I don't know what to do.,"I live in a busy city and surprisingly I am fed up with my downstairs neighbor. My gf and I moved into a new apartment last May and have gotten complaint after complaint from our downstairs neighbor. It began as angry notes pinned to our mailbox which, at first we felt ashamed for walking too loudly, but after the 5th message when were were at home doing nothing besides watching TV and going to bed at 10-11pm we realized our neighbor might be crazy.  We notified the property manager and he said he would tell her no more notes. We were good for a bit, but then she started calling the cops directly. 

Now I am writing this after being woken up in the middle of the night for the third night in two weeks from a violent knock on the door from the city police telling me that a noise complaint was being phoned in from my downstairs neighbor. The police felt as embarrassed as I did when I opened the door in my boxers with them asking  me if I was  having a party. I have no idea what to do legally and what rights I have, but this seems like harassment to me. There is nothing scarier than being woken up in the middle of the night by policemen at your door knocking like it's a big drug raid or something when you are fast asleep. I know laws in California tend to favor the bottom tenant but this seems completely unreasonable.

 Anyways the times we have talked to our downstairs neighbor she has yelled at us and told us we are not ""being like adults"" and ""stepping too loudly"", but we are simply living in our apartment. We both work relatively late, but take our shoes off when we are at home and are careful not to run the dishwasher at night (after an angry note telling us not to do so). A big part of me wants to knock on her door, stomp on the floor and wake her up in the middle of the night too, but I don't want to start an even bigger battle.  I have no idea what to do or legally what I can do. File a harassment suit? Complain once again to our property manager?

The cops told me to talk to the landlord which I did, but I just got woken up again tonight so I guess that didn't work out too well. My gf is fed up, as am I after tonight, but not sure what steps to take next. I live in San Francisco/CA which I know has all sorts of tenant-landlord laws so I feel completely helpless here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   I can post images of the notes if needed.",legaladvice
